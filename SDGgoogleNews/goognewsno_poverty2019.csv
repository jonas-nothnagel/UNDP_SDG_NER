Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer have documented the daily horrors of life for the several million people in the United States who actually do live on $2 a day, in both urban and rural America. Matthew Desmond’s ethnography of Milwaukee explores the nightmare of finding urban shelter among the American poor.

It is hard to imagine poverty that is worse than this, anywhere in the world. Indeed, it is precisely the cost and difficulty of housing that makes for so much misery for so many Americans, and it is precisely these costs that are missed in the World Bank’s global counts.

Of course, people live longer and have healthier lives in rich countries. With only a few (and usually scandalous) exceptions, water is safe to drink, food is safe to eat, sanitation is universal, and some sort of medical care is available to everyone. Yet all these essentials of health are more likely to be lacking for poorer Americans. Even for the whole population, life expectancy in the United States is lower than we would expect given its national income, and there are places — the Mississippi Delta and much of Appalachia — where life expectancy is lower than in Bangladesh and Vietnam.

Beyond that, many Americans, especially whites with no more than a high school education, have seen worsening health: As my research with my wife, the Princeton economist Anne Case, has demonstrated, for this group life expectancy is falling; mortality rates from drugs, alcohol and suicide are rising; and the long historical decline in mortality from heart disease has come to a halt.

I believe, as do most people, that we have an obligation to assist the truly destitute. For those who believe that aid is effective, this is reflected in their own giving, or by supporting national and international organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank or Oxfam.

For years, in determining this spending, the needs of poor Americans (or poor Europeans) have received little priority relative to the needs of Africans or Asians. As an economist concerned with global poverty, I have long accepted this practical and ethical framework. In my own giving, I have prioritized the faraway poor over the poor at home.","This evidence supports on-the-ground observation in the United States.

Remarks in Za'atari camp in Jordan as delivered:

“It is heartbreaking to return to Jordan and witness the levels of hardship and trauma among Syrian refugees as the war enters its eighth year.

We in UNHCR are deeply grateful to the Jordanian people, for their generosity and humanity towards the victims of the conflict.

Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq now host nearly 5 ½ million Syrian refugees between them.

They really are an example to the world, at a time when solidarity with refugees is in short supply.

We should be under no illusions that this is a crisis that has been out of control for years.

UNHCR does not have the funds to provide in full even the most basic necessities for survival for many families:

Last year, the UNHCR response for the Syria crisis was only 50 per cent funded.

And so far in 2018, it is only 7 per cent funded.

There is nothing more devastating for UNHCR staff than not to be able to give people the help they need and deserve.

After seven years of war, most Syrian refugees have exhausted any savings they had.

The vast majority of them already live below the poverty line, on less than three dollars a day.

Imagine what that would mean for your family.

Here, it means families going without sufficient food; children unable to get medical treatment; young girls vulnerable to early marriage; and many Syrians facing their seventh winter without proper shelter.

This is the reality of those displaced by the conflict in Syria, and I want to thank all the journalists who continue tirelessly to cover these stories and bring them to the attention of the world.

We know that the fundamental issue is not that people don’t know what it happening. It is the lack of a credible political and diplomatic process - based on human rights and international law - to bring the violence to an end.

A viable political settlement is the only way to create the conditions for Syrians to return to their homes, and to end the human suffering and the strain on host countries.

Humanitarian aid is not a long-term solution. And to be clear, no one wants to get off aid relief more than Syrian families. For such an educated, capable people, it is soul-destroying to be made this dependent.

So I would urge the Security Council members to come to the region, to visit the camps and the urban refugees, and find a way to finally bring the full weight of the UN and international community to bear to solve this conflict.

We should never forget that the war began with demands by Syrians for greater human rights.

Peace in their country has to be built on that.

It cannot be built on impunity for the targeting of civilians by all sides, the bombing of schools and hospitals, barrel bombs, torture, chemical weapons and rape used as a weapon of war.

It must be built on accountability – for instance, justice and recognition for the years of violence that women in Syria have faced.

So that is my message to the international community today: yes, of course, please do moreto help meet the needs of desperate Syrian families, and the countries hosting them.

But above all please provide the leadership and strength needed to negotiate a principled end to this senseless war – without sacrificing the dignity and human rights of Syrian families. That is non-negotiable.

Thank you all for letting me speak to you today.

David Letterman’s woolly, post-CBS beard might be the guiding aesthetic for his new Netflix talk show. My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman (quite the grammatical train wreck, that title) does away with the band, the Top 10 list, the neatly delineated segments with various guests, and nearly everything else we once associated with him on Late Show. That’s not to say there’s no method at all here, just that this is a more relaxed format than we’ve seen Letterman anchor in the past.

Letterman’s inaugural guest, former President Barack Obama, sits with him for over 40 minutes without commercial interruption, before a live audience, and talks about life after the presidency, his relationship with his mother, father, wife, and kids, the challenges of global poverty, changing technology and growing income inequality, and most movingly, the struggles of the civil-rights movement, without which he would never have become a political force himself. It’s in this section that My Next Guest veers away from what you might’ve expected, segueing to a handsomely photographed sequence of Letterman and John Lewis, U.S. representative for Georgia’s 5th congressional district, walking over Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, the site of two legendary marches in 1965, one of which found Lewis enduring a beating by police. It’s fun to imagine Netflix subscribers clicking on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction because they’re looking to kill an hour and want to see what ol’ Dave is up to these days, and coming away with a miniature history lesson about one of the most important events in 20th-century U.S. history. That the episode takes its sweet time before returning in earnest to Letterman’s conversation with Obama suggests all manner of potentially fruitful avenues for future installments. Freed not only of commercial interruption but of the need to adhere to any particular structure, the show could go wherever Letterman’s mind decides to wander.

Other than the avoidance of anything related to Donald Trump, there’s nothing about this Obama interview that could really qualify as news — not that Letterman gives any indication of caring about generating headlines. A quarter of the discussion is a bit fluffy, and much of the rest covers ground that has been well-trod elsewhere. But the obvious comfort level between them does lend their discussion an air of intimacy that’s rare in sitdowns between people who are as prominent in their respective fields as these two. The title itself feels like a bit of humblebrag, but at this point it’s an earned indulgence, especially when your first subject is a two-term president. Letterman was never known for his interrogatory skills anyway — the occasional delightful curveball notwithstanding — and nothing he does here is going to reverse that impression. But his willingness to ramp things down into borderline small talk is fascinating because there isn’t much tradition for that kind of thing in the modern American talk show, which is still driven mainly by questions generated during backstage pre-interviews and consequently tends to feel canned, even when guest and host are having a good time. The looser and more structurally inventive things get here, the more fascinating the results could be.","Photo: NetflixDavid Letterman’s woolly, post-CBS beard might be the guiding aesthetic for his new Netflix talk show.

3,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/09/apple-tracking-block-costs-advertising-companies-millions-dollars-criteo-web-browser-safari,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,"No tracking, no revenue: Apple's privacy feature costs ad companies millions","Internet advertising firms are losing hundreds of millions of dollars following the introduction of a new privacy feature from Apple that prevents users from being tracked around the web.

Advertising technology firm Criteo, one of the largest in the industry, says that the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) feature for Safari, which holds 15% of the global browser market, is likely to cut its 2018 revenue by more than a fifth compared to projections made before ITP was announced.

With annual revenue in 2016 topping $730m, the overall cost of the privacy feature on just one company is likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Dennis Buchheim, general manager of the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Tech Lab, said that the feature would impact the industry widely.

“We expect a range of companies are facing similar negative impacts from Apple’s Safari tracking changes. Moreover, we anticipate that Apple will retain ITP and evolve it over time as they see fit,” Buchheim told the Guardian.

“There will surely be some continued efforts to ‘outwit’ ITP, but we recommend more sustainable, responsible approaches in the short-term,” Buchheim added. “We also want to work across the industry (ideally including Apple) longer-term to address more robust, cross-device advertising targeting and measurement capabilities that are also consumer friendly.”

‘Sabotage’

ITP was announced in June 2017 and released for iPhones, iPads and Macs in September. The feature prevents Apple users from being tracked around the internet through careful management of “cookies”, small pieces of code that allow an advertising technology company to continually identify users as they browse.

Q&A What is a cookie? Show A cookie is a small text file a website can drop on to a visitor's computer when it wants to remember something about them. The contents of a shopping trolley, perhaps, or whether or not they are logged in to the site at all. But cookies can also be used in less user-friendly ways. An advertising network can drop a cookie on a visitor's computer, and then read that same cookie at every new website the visitor arrives at that displays that network's adverts. This process lets the network track users around the web, building up a profile of their browsing habits to better target them for adverts.

Its launch sparked complaints from the advertising industry, which called ITP “sabotage”. An open letter signed by six advertising trade bodies called on Apple “to rethink its plan … [that risks] disrupting the valuable digital advertising ecosystem that funds much of today’s digital content and services.”

It also accused the company of ignoring internet standards, which say that a cookie should remain on a computer until it expires naturally or is manually removed by a user. Instead, the industry said, Apple is replacing those standards “with an amorphous set of shifting rules that will hurt the user experience and sabotage the economic model for the internet”.

In response, Apple noted that: “Ad tracking technology has become so pervasive that it is possible for ad tracking companies to recreate the majority of a person’s web browsing history. This information is collected without permission and is used for ad re-targeting, which is how ads follow people around the internet.”

Initially, many advertisers believed they had found a technological way around some of the restrictions put in place by ITP. Criteo, which took advantage of that loophole, had initially expected revenue to drop by only 9-13%, the company said. But in December, Apple closed that work-around on its mobile devices as part of the iOS 11.2 update, causing the ad-tech firm to update its projected impact to its current estimate of 22% “relative to our pre-ITP base case projections”.

The company has not given up hope, however. “We are focused on developing an alternative sustainable solution for the long term, built on our best-in-class user privacy standards, aligning the interests of Apple users, publishers and advertisers,” Criteo said in a press release. “This solution is still under development and its effectiveness cannot be assessed at this early stage.”

There is more pain to come for the advertising industry. Google has announced a built-in adblocker for its Chrome, which holds over 55% of the global browser market according to data from Statcounter. Google has been testing the feature since June 2017 and will roll it out to all users in February.

Unlike Safari’s ITP, however, Chrome’s adblocker has been created in partnership with the ad industry. The feature only blocks what the company calls “intrusive ads”, such as autoplaying video and audio, popovers which block content, or interstitial ads that take up the entire screen.","Dennis Buchheim, general manager of the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Tech Lab, said that the feature would impact the industry widely.

There is one statistic in particular that might make us think when it comes to tidying up after the festivities: roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption gets lost or wasted every year.

This equates to approximately 1.3 billion tons, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) - equivalent to more than half of the world's annual cereals crop.

At the same time, 795 million people around the world were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2014-2016.

In the UK alone, 8.4m people in the UK struggle to afford a meal, according to the UN's FAO - despite the UK wasting billions through food waste every year, according to food waste charity WRAP.

A financial loss

It's not just a people cost. While hungry mouths are the most stark example of the cost of food waste, there is a huge financial cost to food going to rot as well.

Food losses and waste is estimated to amount to $680bn in industrialized countries around the world, as well as a further $310bn in developing countries.

It is important to distinguish between food loss and waste:

Food loss: Occurs between production and retail

Occurs between production and retail Food waste: Occurs between consumption and retail

Unsurprisingly, the proportion of food waste is highest in western countries, while developing countries are more likely to suffer from food loss.","This equates to approximately 1.3 billion tons, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) - equivalent to more than half of the world's annual cereals crop.

Dr Tatu Kamau, who has held a number of high-level positions at the Ministry of Health, told a high court that Kenya’s 2011 ban on FGM was unconstitutional and discriminated against “national heritage”.

Kamau claimed that women who choose to harm their bodies through drink or cigarettes should also have the freedom to decide whether they are cut.

“If women can decide to drink, to smoke, women can join the army, women can do all sorts of things that might bring them harm or injury … a woman can [also] make that decision,” she told KTN News after filing papers to overturn the ban.

“And once she has made that decision, she should be able to access the best medical care to have it done.”

Kenya outlawed the long-standing practice in 2011. Sweeping provisions made it illegal to carry out or help someone to procure FGM. Failure to report the practice, or stigmatising a woman – or any man who marries or supports her – for not undergoing the procedure were also banned. Causing death by performing FGM became punishable with life imprisonment and a fine of 200,000 Kenyan shillings (£1,372).

According to the UN population fund (UNFPA), 21% of girls and women in Kenya aged 15-49 have undergone FGM.

But the ban has pushed the practice further underground.

FGM, which usually requires the partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora and majora, is almost always performed without anasthesia by traditional cutters, often using unsterilised blades. Those subjected to the practice can bleed to death or die from infection, or experience serious complications during childbirth.

While Kamau’s petition to outlaw the practice has been met with contempt by local and international FGM activists, some tribal elders from Kenya’s Marakwet district have welcomed the move, claiming that they had been “hunted and punished for engaging in our cultural right”.

Maasai FGM activist Agnes Pareyio, who was cut at 14 against her will and has since founded the Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative to educate women and girls about the practice, said Kamau’s petition – expected to be heard by Machakos high court in eastern Kenya on 26 February – was an insult to women as it proved the doctor did not understand the brutality behind the practice.

“I am a survivor and I know the extent of the pain that women go through with FGM – it is a violation of our human rights,” Pareyio said. “Many women still think this is a process they must go through, but when you explain that not every woman is cut, not every society does this, they question why we do it. How can you try to legalise something that kills women? I think [Kamau] is trying to make history.”

Brendan Wynne, of Donor Direct Action, an international women’s group that runs an FGM fund for frontline activists, said it was potentially dangerous for a female doctor of such high standing in Kenyan society to take such legal action.

“The fact that a doctor is calling for an extremely harmful human rights abuse to be made legal is incredible. She clearly has no idea about the implications for women and girls,” said Wynne.



“We can’t afford to waste time opening up this debate again while so many millions of girls are still at risk. African women on the front lines need to be supported instead in their efforts to end FGM once and for all.”FGM – which affects 200 million women around the world – is still extremely prevalent in certain parts of Kenya, particularly among the Kisii, Maasai, Samburu and Somali communities (pdf), where some girls are cut before the age of five.

Campaigners argue that the ban enables girls to reject a practice often forced upon them by their parents or elders.

“Women’s bodies should be valued and respected,” said Josephine Carlsson of Feed the Minds, a charity working to end FGM through education and awareness programmes with the Kuria group in Kenya.

“The fact that FGM is illegal and remains illegal is an important message from society and has already brought the prevalence of FGM down in Kenya, but more work needs to be done to change attitudes, which this debate only illustrates too well. Our partners on the ground fully support the legislation and are absolutely convinced FGM must remain illegal in order to protect women from violence.”","A Kenyan doctor has been accused of “trying to make history” after filing a controversial petition to legalise female genital mutilation.

It was a swell to start: A reaction to an unexpected and disappointing election result. But it has turned into a vibrant movement. Organizers of this year’s marches took stock of breakthroughs, retrogression and righteous anger and called women to take action — to do whatever it takes to secure good lives for all women.

This is not just an American phenomenon: Globally, women are mobilizing for their rights, amplifying their voices and working together. Their collective demands include respect for human dignity, women’s equality and gender justice.

Global feminism is the vision. Worldwide marches are the method. Social media provides a means to amplify their voices and collective agency.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito

The March On rallies are no joke. Crowds in the U.S. in 2017 were estimated at 3.5 to 5.5 million. This year’s estimate was 637 marches attended by five million people globally.

They are a highly visible shoutout to deliver on women’s equality: To end harassment, sexual assault and femicide; to end poverty, racism and religious intolerance; and to safeguard the rights of the vulnerable and the trumped-upon.

Resistance: Anger in 2017

The Women’s March on Washington the day after the inauguration of the 45th U.S. president should have been, could have been, would have been an outpouring of relief that finally — finally! — the most powerful office in the world was occupied by a woman.

What a party that would have been!

Instead, the opportunity turned to ashes. Disbelief and anger deepened until it became clear that not only was the president a pussy-grabber, but his Islamophobia, racism, sexism and xenophobia were his own special sauce to be smeared on the reputation of the United States of America at every turn. Last January, did anyone think it could be so bad, and would get so much worse?

Worldwide, people marched in reaction to Trump before they knew about dark money, Russian interference in the U.S. election and the brazen brinksmanship that is propelling the U.S. toward global ignominy.

Galvanized by #MeToo and immunized by a year of Trump in office, March On said less about Trump and his antics in 2018.

Instead it offered a message: The rise of women is the rise of the nation, and this is a nation in which Black Lives Matter and #IndigenousLivesMatter.

This is the promise of “intersectional” feminism — a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, a preeminent Black legal theorist, in 1989 as she confronted discrimination in feminist theory for missing the importance of race and class.

Insistence: Call to action

The momentum of this movement is growing. The biggest breakthrough in 2017 was the emergence of a new period of activism and the determination to sustain it.

With increasing strength comes calls for action. Black women voters in Alabama successfully blocked the Republican candidate for the Senate and elected Democrat Doug Jones.

Organizers in Las Vegas, Nev. held a second day to their march: Power to the Polls, saying: “We are the leaders we have been waiting for.” The Vegas event emphasized voter registration to turn sentiment into ballots on Election Day. On Nov. 6, in most U.S. locales, 435 people will be elected to the House of Representatives, 33 to the 100-seat Senate and 39 to governorships in states and territories.

Internationally, UN Women produced a timeline of gender equality for 2017 headlined by the #MeToo movement, the laws prohibiting violence against women and the conviction of the “butcher of Bosnia” for crimes that include sexual violence and murder.

Canada: A select roundup

In Canada, Time’s Up for women to live unsafely in their own families and communities. Time’s Up for pay inequities. Time’s Up for women not to lead as often as they follow.

March On Canada 2018 affirmed: “There is still work to do. And so, we march on.” At 38 events across the country, speakers connected a diverse set of local issues to the need for action.

In Halifax, a counter- demonstration peeled away from the main event to promote some of the city’s marginalized voices, calling on march organizers to walk the talk for safe spaces, anti-racism, indigiqueer and trans perspectives.

Regina drew attention to rates of intimate partner violence that are the highest in the country, double the national rate of sexual assault. Attendance increased from a handful of activists last year to 600 participants in 2018.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young

Speakers in Vancouver also condemned rates of sexual assault and encouraged women to take up leadership roles in communities.

“The oppression that we deal with today is deliberate and intentional, so they need to be deliberately and intentionally dismantled,” Indigenous activist Rhiannon Barnett told the marchers.

Winnipeg also highlighted violence against women, especially the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry and a call for justice in the beating to death of teen Serena McKay in April.

Support for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women was prominent at the march in Windsor, Ont., which both named seven local women who were missing and murdered.

In Victoria, writer and activist Zainab bint Younus told marchers: “On a daily basis, myself and thousands of other Muslim women endure verbal and physical harassment due to our identities as women and as Muslims. I stand here to tell you that we will not allow this to continue.” She urged the audience to challenge hate crimes and to join Muslim women in solidarity.

Marchers in Sandy Cove, N.S., population 65, gained international attention in 2017 for a video of their 16-person Women’s March turnout that has received nearly a quarter of a million views. In 2018, Sandy Cove doubled its turnout to 32.

Persistence: Marching on

In 2019, we will know if the U.S. president is closer to impeachment or resignation for personal reasons. The midterms this November may constrain the executive branch from its worst excesses.

Regardless, women’s activism is needed to say no to Islamophobia, no to racism, no to sexism and no to xenophobia. Not on the women’s watch. The pressure of the growing movement repeats the message, “no means no,” whenever inhabitants of the U.S. or anywhere else are demeaned, denied their dignity or prevented from the exercise of human rights or women’s rights.

This method — to grow the belief that affirms this vision — can prevail. Resistance, insistence and persistence are powerful motivations.

The next global march occurs on March 8 on International Women’s Day. The theme is “Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming women’s lives.”

Have no doubt: This is a neural network — promoted through social media — that excites the imagination and encourages women to use their voices, realize their visions and contribute to its success. The growth and vibrancy of this diverse network is a force for good.","The first anniversary of the Women’s March on Washington last weekend indicates support is growing for feminist activism.

This is the latest, and probably the final, wave of no-cause evictions at the apartment complex, where tenant rights have gone head-to-head against its ownership for the past year.

Previous eviction notices began early last year but were later rescinded following a public outcry. Tenants who remained in their units then received a rent increase Oct. 1, followed by a new wave of 90-day evictions issued Nov. 1.

The evictions are the subject of a lawsuit by the Oregon Law Center representing 19 tenants who say their ouster is retaliation for complaining about the condition of the units. The tenants had asked that the rent increase be rescinded until repairs were made to the units. The no-cause evictions arrived soon after.

And barring any change in plans by the building’s owner, the largely Latino community will be dispersed from the St. Johns complex, which is being updated with better amenities and higher rents.

José “Chepe” Vierra, a tenant of The Melrose, said “the situation is critical” for his family. He said he can’t find affordable rentals near his current home and his family needs more time. Vierra is 63 years old, and spoke in Spanish as he stood in an apartment with rotting living room carpet and a dilapidated kitchen floor.

Another tenant, who declined to give her name but will go by Maria for this story, was thankful her family found a new apartment just days before it was time to vacate. Still, she said, standing in her living room and rocking a 7-month-old child, the move is a hardship for her family.

The initial eviction notices went out soon after the sale of the property, then known as Titan Manor, in October 2016, Willamette Week reported. Then Oregon Public Broadcasting looked into the new ownership group and found links to T. Gary Rogers, a Californian who’s been CEO of Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, chairman of Levi Strauss & Co. and chairman of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. The property is being managed by Avenue 5 Residential LLC.

Staff at the Community Alliance of Tenants have been working with residents in the 45-year-old North Fessenden Street complex since 2014. But it was after the current owners began issuing eviction notices that it become a symbol for the city’s affordable-housing crisis. The building was purchased by a group of limited liability companies for $8.3 million and renamed The Melrose.

“We are deeply disappointed to hear that our friends and neighbors are being told to leave their homes,” CAT and the Titan Manor Tenants Alliance wrote in a December letter to owners and managers. “More disturbing is that we began to trust you and your intentions when your change of heart prompted you to rescind the termination notices 10 months ago.”

There’s no evidence the owners and managers intend to discriminate, but the waves of evictions at The Melrose fall predominately on the shoulders of the Latino community that calls the building home.

“At the end of the day, it feels like economic and ethnic cleansing,” said Katrina Holland, executive director of CAT, echoing the sentiment of some residents. “You can’t pay, so whatever. You’ve got to go.”

Dan Lavey, a spokesman for the owners, said: “We categorically reject any inference or charge that race or ethnicity has anything to do with the renovations and changes at the Melrose.”

The owners maintain that the building needs repairs that can’t occur while residents stay in their units, necessitating the evictions.

“While nearly half of the residences were renovated in just a few months, further work remains to ensure that every residence is improved to meet the expectations shared by our residents, owners and city officials,” Lavey said in a statement. “To expedite the renovation process, in November, the difficult decision was made to give residents living in un-renovated units official notice that they will need to seek different housing arrangements. In accordance with city law, each resident has roughly three months to secure different housing.”

Lavey said that to date, 30 affected residents have received $4,000 each in relocation assistance from the apartment owners and have been offered $200 for moving assistance.

However the lawsuit notes four Melrose eviction recipients were tenants whose apartments already had been substantially renovated or who had already been relocated into newly renovated apartments in the past year.

After complaints from tenants, city inspectors found 490 housing code violations at the former Titan Manor, the most that any single property in Portland has ever received, according to CAT.

According to the lawsuit, code violations were rampant under the previous owner. Numerous inspections by the Bureau of Development Services dating back to June 2015 record multiple, repeated violations and a failure to correct the violations. It also found new violations last year related to electrical, plumbing and mechanical repair work conducted without proper permits and inspections.

Tenants reported mold and mildew throughout their units, toilet and bathtubs that were not secured or leaked, rodent, cockroach and bedbug infestations, leaking or malfunctioning appliances and severe dilapidation.

Lavey and an attorney for the Oregon Law Center declined to discuss the lawsuit, which seeks approximately $4,000 to $5,000 for each of its 19 residents.

Maria and José Vierra aren’t in the lawsuit or working with CAT, but they’re part of what appears to be a majority of tenants who are Latino.

More than half of the 19 plaintiffs in the lawsuit have Latino surnames. A school secretary at the majority-Latino school James John Elementary, Angela Diaz-Deleon, said she was aware of 20 students living at Titan Manor/The Melrose whose families got eviction notices last year – all of whom were Latino.

“We’ve lost some and kept some,” Diaz-Deleon said. “This week I’ve had two families who have come with those eviction notices.”

Vierra and his wife, Julia Morales, pay $900 for the dilapidated two-bedroom apartment they have lived in for 18 years. They said The Melrose’s Seattle-based management company, Avenue 5 Residential LLC, won’t accept their application to move to a vacant renovated unit at a higher price point.

Vierra said managers haven’t responded to calls from other property managers calling for a reference from those who found other places to go, like his nephew, who lives in a separate unit.

“They don’t answer the phone for references,” Morales said.

Policy and Organizing Director Pamela Phan of CAT said she’s heard similar complaints from other residents trying to move, though lately managers “have made some effort” to return calls for references.

Lavey said the idea that managers wouldn’t return calls for references “doesn’t seem logical.”

As of press time, Avenue 5 Resident LLC had not replied to an inquiry Street Roots sent to its media email.

Lavey confirmed the building’s manager left the job Jan. 16. He said it’s “not accurate” to say applications from current residents have been turned away. Lavey said the owners and managers are “streamlining the application process and waiving fees for those impacted residents wishing to move to a different unit.”

One thing that no one disputes is that the owners are intent on fixing up the property after years of neglect. On Jan. 18, Sherwin-Williams vans decorated the parking lot, maintenance workers were busy, and paint fumes filled the air. New design elements graced exterior walls.

Lavey emphasized that owners are dedicated to providing a “healthier, cleaner, safer, warmer place for people to live.”

“We believe strongly that we’re doing everything possible to make The Melrose a better place for the residents,” Lavey said.

CAT’s Phan said the focus is on the building, not its residents.

“I’ve spoken to the owner several times, also site manager and leasing manager, and it’s pretty consistent that folks see (them) as units that provide income, and they definitely do not see the residents who live there,” she said.

Not all facing eviction are people of color. Those who aren’t, however, may be vulnerable in other ways.

Sam, 62, struggled to lift groceries up weather-beaten stairs badly in need of a paint job to his second-story home.

“Everybody’s getting evicted, far as I know,” Sam said, declining to give a last name. He said he’s looking for a new place, but his Social Security income doesn’t go far enough for most potential landlords.

“I’m looking hard and trying. Nothing’s affordable. I’m like $400, $500 short of three times the rent. It’s terrible.”

His monthly Social Security income has only gone up about $20 each year, he said. Housing prices, of course, are far outstripping that rate: $1,330 was the median rent for a one-bedroom in December for the Portland area, according to the real estate website Zumper. Rent Jungle averaged Portland-area one-bedrooms at $1,471 and two-bedrooms at $1,776.

“You know how it is,” Sam said as he crossed the threshold of his apartment.

Some of those who live in the building are undocumented immigrants, including Maria. Their lack of legal documentation can present a significant additional barrier to finding a new apartment.

The language and legal barriers also often lead undocumented families to shun making connections with advocates or unknown organizations. Maria said food stamps are the only help her family receives. Undocumented immigrants qualify for food stamps only if they have a child who was born in the United States.

“Sometimes it makes you afraid, because we don’t have papers,” Maria said. “Since we’re undocumented, we don’t often feel inspired to speak up or organize.”

She said she’s watched many families leave for Gresham, Vancouver or East Portland, which she described, with a flash of gold teeth and a shrug, as “out on 130th and … I don’t know what.”

Her family is luckier than Sam’s or José Vierra’s: They already know where they’re headed, and their new apartment is nearby. Maria’s kindergartner won’t have to switch schools. But that doesn’t make it easy.

“The truth is, it affects you,” Maria said quietly. “All this time living here and a letter comes saying you have to go. It’s unjust.”

8,https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/israel-no-country-for-black-people-12900274,"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Independent Online,Israel: no country for black people,"Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that African refugees had three months to get out of the country.

Describing African refugees numbering about 40 000 as “infiltrators”, Netanyahu said they had two choices. They could either accept a once-off payment of $3500 (R42300) and relocate to another African country or spend the rest of their life in jail in Israel. They have until March to decide.

The announcement drew immediate outrage. But for those following the daily travails and humiliation endured by African refugees in Israel, it was the brazenness of Netanyahu’s crass plan that has appalled us.

For months, there has been talk of a secret pact in which refugees and asylum seekers from Sudan or Eritrea would be relocated to Uganda and Rwanda for a fee. Uganda and Rwanda have both denied any deal but NGOs and journalists say at least 1500 have already been transferred to these two countries.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) noted that the refugees - many of whom had suffered trauma and torture - were being dropped into their new surroundings without any care, support or security.

The Jerusalem Post reported this week that there were mixed emotions to the plan in south Tel Aviv where pockets of refugees live in poor ghettos.

One resident described Africans as “rapists and murderers”. Others confirmed that something had to be done to reclaim their city and country.

“There used to be space for our children, but now it’s like Africa here - like we are not in Israel anymore. They are taking all the space and the Israeli families have no space left,” one man said.

But there really isn’t anything to be surprised about. The decision to push Africans out is part of a story of preservation of the Jewish state from “infiltrators”. This is a country obsessed with “ethnic purity”. Take the events around its founding in 1948 when about 700 000 Palestinians were booted out of their homes and made permanent refugees.

Or take the Law of Return for instance. This allows any Jew anywhere in the world to become an immediate Israeli citizen, but it is willing to expel refugees - many of whom who have walked for days and months, crossed deserts and dodged bullets to get to Israel with purview of a better life.

Of course, once they get there, Israel is not the progressive oasis it is made out to be. The decision to push out Africans is merely an extension of its policy of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians - be it pushing them out of Jerusalem, encouraging settlers to take over Palestinian lands in the West Bank, or suffocating others in Gaza.

As a signatory to the Refugee Convention, Israel is obliged to allow refugees in, provide social services and ensure they are not deported. But Israel has continuously sidestepped its legal responsibility to the Refugee Convention by creating unco-operative and inhospitable conditions for refugees. They are neither provided with services nor given the chance to apply for asylum. They are coerced to leave. It is deportation by all accounts except in name.

We all hear about US President Donald Trump’s wall to keep out Mexicans but Israel already has one in the Sinai to ensure no more asylum seekers enter through Egypt (and a wall that keeps out Palestinians from the West Bank).

Naturally, the right wing has lauded the move, but it has hurt the sentiments of liberal Zionists. Whereas the treatment and killing of Palestinians could be masked under “security” concerns, there is little domestic “justification” for the poor treatment of African refugees who had come to their country in search of a better life.

That East Africa was floated as a possible home for the persecuted Jews of Europe in the early 20th century is an irony seemingly lost on the Israeli government.

A hundred years later, Israelis are sending persecuted Sudanese and Eritreans en masse to a similar destination. Liberal Zionists are at a loss for words.

They know there is no way they can explain any of this.

Responding to the Israeli government’s plan, and in a bid to show that Israel is not the sum of its policies towards African refugee seekers, a group of rabbis created the The Anne Frank Home Sanctuary movement. The programme - named after the Jewish teenager who hid herself from the Nazis during World War II - calls on Israelis to hide African asylum seekers from forced expulsion.

Rabbi Susan Silverman who started the initiative, said people had “risked their lives to save Jews, and we as a country are now saying we don’t want to risk the tiniest demographic shift?

“We have a prime minister who is quoting Pharaoh when he says (of the asylum seekers) that their numbers will grow. Pharaoh said the Hebrew slaves will grow and overcome us.”

But the actions of the rabbis will do little to change the fact that this is a country that until 2014, had granted refugee status to no more than 200 people.

The UN Refugee Agency says of the 60 000 African refugees who have come to Israel in the past decade, just 10 have been recognised by the state as refugees.

For how long will these rabbis hide them? And what kind of life will they lead?

Seventy years after its formation, Israel is still defined by the expulsion of people.

Meanwhile, a few streets away, magnetic sensors under the road surface allow drivers to find out in advance if a parking space is free - saving them time and cutting back on vehicle emissions.

Other high-technology solutions for street lamps, traffic lights and parking meters have been deployed in Spain’s second-largest city in recent years.

One theatre is even decked with a smart vertical garden on its outer wall, which collects its own rainwater via a solar-powered system on the roof.

As one of Europe’s richest cities, most of Barcelona’s inhabitants already have good access to municipal services and a high quality of life.

But in poorer parts of the world, urban experts say efforts to improve cities with cutting-edge technology can run into challenges, particularly when applied in slums.

“A 24-hour smart water meter can only be possible if you’re connected to the water system in the first place,” said Ayona Datta, a reader in urban futures at King’s College London.

In developing countries, technology may be introduced across a city to make transport or water services more efficient, but will likely only work in its richer areas, she added.

The idea of giving the same thing to everyone in both middle-class and low-income neighbourhoods can be problematic, she said.

“IT companies will sell (smart technology) as a package without any kind of customisation at a grassroots level,” she said.

Smart technology installed like this is “giving the icing on the cake to people who are already connected”, Datta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

In many cases, those who lack access to electricity or the internet cannot benefit from high-tech infrastructure, she added.

“You really need to engage with the social context (and) social issues first,” she emphasised.

India controversy

In India, dozens of smart cities are planned as the South Asian nation seeks ways of coping with rapid growth in its urban population.

By 2050, India will have an additional 300 million urban residents, according to UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency that deals with cities.

But one high-profile “smart city” strategy for Dholera, in Gujarat state, has sparked opposition.

It involves a new 920-km (572-mile) metropolis on the edge of the ancient port city, set to run mostly on solar power and intended to become a global manufacturing hub.

Critics say it will displace subsistence farmers, is at risk of inundation due to being built on a floodplain, and will cost more than planned.

“A lot of smart city projects are real estate projects,” said Nancy Odendaal, an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Cape Town.

“On the African continent this becomes particularly poignant as it is seen as the last frontier for property speculation and development,” she added.

Gentrification

In most of Africa, smart cities tend to be “top-down” projects to create satellite cities, like Konza Technopolis in Kenya and Eko Atlantic City in Nigeria, Odendaal noted.

Dubbed “Africa’s Dubai”, Eko Atlantic is being built on Victoria Island next to Lagos. Developers say it will become a new financial headquarters for Nigeria as well as solving chronic housing shortages in Lagos.

Detractors argue that shiny urban centres like Eko Atlantic are designed for a wealthy elite, and do nothing to help poor communities living on their doorstep.

Elsewhere, smart city strategies have received a mixed reception.

Rwanda’s capital Kigali was praised for becoming one of the first cities in Africa to roll out free wireless internet in some areas in 2013.

However, it has also been criticised for building new housing ordinary Rwandans cannot afford.

In South Africa’s Cape Town, some people see smart city projects as an excuse for gentrification - “just another way of turning old neighbourhoods into swish, consumer zones”, said Odendaal.

“Know your city”

Some of the most effective schemes are those that harness technology but are not marketed by governments as “smart”, she said.

They include Map Kibera, which began as a free, open digital map of Africa’s largest slum in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. It has grown into an interactive project pinpointing local services and providing information about security in Kibera.

Its developers, Map Kibera Trust, say the initiative gives visibility to marginalised communities, with two other Nairobi slums replicating the idea.

Non-governmental groups like Slum Dwellers International (SDI) are also doing useful work at grassroots level, said Odendaal.

The network of community-based organisations representing the urban poor in 32 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America runs a “Know Your City” campaign.

Slum residents collect data and information about where they live, which is held in a central database and can be used by governments and other decision-makers.

SDI says the data is owned by the community, and gives an “informed and united” voice to the urban poor.

“Smart technology has very utopian intentions but it’s really about how it’s implemented on the ground,” said Datta. “It is very universal but has to be rooted in the context of a place in order for it to work.”

Community-led initiatives can function especially well, as in India where local people have started sharing photos of suspected sex offenders on instant messaging service WhatsApp, she said.

“Smart technology has had all sorts of unintended consequences,” she added. “What emerges can exist completely outside of state regulation.”

THE US State Department released an updated travel advisory for the country yesterday, telling its citizens to stay clear of popular cultural restaurant hub the Fish Fry at Arawak Cay at night.

Tourism Minister Dionisio D’Aguilar told The Tribune the advisory was “odd and troubling,” adding he was “at a loss” over why the State Department would opt to target the area given there is an on-site police station.

The advisory ranks the Bahamas at ‘Level 2: Exercise increase caution,’ stating that violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies and sexual assault are common, even during daylight hours and in tourist areas.

The State Department maintained its stance banning embassy personnel from visiting the Sand Trap in Nassau or using Jet Ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Island; however, its latest warning strikes a major blow to one of the city’s most popular cultural offerings, the Fish Fry.

In an interview with The Tribune yesterday, Mr D’Aguilar stressed there was no comparison between the safety enjoyed in the Caribbean with crime levels in major American cities.

“The Bahamas is a very safe destination if you consider in comparison with London or Chicago and New York,” he said.

“Some 6.3 million (guests) come to the country each year. This is an important area for Bahamian businesses, this is the first I’m hearing about it (travel advisory).

“The Fish Fry is visited by many guests every year without incident,” Mr D’Aguilar said.

“I would consider it a very safe place for our foreign visitors. I’m at a loss as to why they would specifically pick that out and in addition to that there is a police station there so the government has taken steps to ensure it’s safe.

“It’s very odd and troubling and I will investigate why.”

Yesterday, vendors on the strip underscored the critical importance of both local and tourist traffic, expressing major concerns over the advisory’s impact on eateries struggling to survive in the current economic climate.

Jason Burrows, proprietor of Deep Creek, called on the government to make an immediate intervention. The restaurant has been at Arawak Cay for 15 years.

“That’s ridiculous, why would they say something like that?” Mr Burrows said.

“Arawak Cay is a place that tourists and Bahamians alike come out and enjoy themselves. I can’t see the American embassy or any embassy in this country put out some kind of advisory like that because we’re so small, this is a cultural spot and I would hope that the government and everybody would put a stop to all of the nonsense.

“We have small businesses out here trying to advance themselves, trying to keep people employed and trying to do the right thing, so when you hear things like this… this is what they are trying to do is stop us from making a living. And I think that’s really poor.”

He continued: “Nights are important, right now we’re trying to do some other stuff out here, more cultural, to bring it together but we need help with people like the American embassy - if they would send more people out here and instead try to help us to make this a better place. This is the only cultural spot, so why do you want to put a black mark or a bad name on it?”

Mr Burrows acknowledged the area was not immune to crime or conflict, but said it was important to contextualise incidents as it was not representative of the business community.

In line with previous travel warnings, the State Department also advises its citizens to avoid the Over-the-Hill area.

“Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault is common, even during daylight hours and in tourist areas,” the notice said. “US government personnel are not permitted to visit the Sand Trap area in Nassau due to crime. Jet Ski operators are known to commit sexual assaults against tourists, including minors. As a result, US government personnel are not permitted to use Jet Ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Island.

“. . .If you decide to travel to the Bahamas: avoid the area known as ‘Over-the-Hill’ (south of south of Shirley Street) and Fish Fry at Arawak Cay in Nassau at night. Do not answer your door at your hotel/residence unless you know who it is. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.”

The updated advisory came as the State Department launched its new travel advisory programme - a revamp of its Consular Information Programme - that retires travel warnings and alerts in lieu of a streamlined four tier-ranking system.

Level 1 and 2 countries are reviewed on an annual basis, unless there are special circumstances, according to Michelle Bernier-Toth, acting deputy assistant secretary for overseas citizens services in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, during a press briefing on the new advisories.

Ms Bernier-Toth explained that local embassies are authorised to provide host governments with an advance copy of the final travel advisory for their country - “if they thought it was important;” however, she noted host governments did not have the ability to change the language contained in the advisory.","By AVA TURNQUESTTribune Chief Reporteraturnquest@tribunemedia.netand RASHAD ROLLETribune Staff Reporterrrolle@tribunemedia.netTHE US State Department released an updated travel advisory for the country yesterday, telling its citizens to stay clear of popular cultural restaurant hub the Fish Fry at Arawak Cay at night.

13,https://reason.com/volokh/2018/01/30/no-libertarians-have-not-thrown-in-with/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Reason,"No, Libertarians Have Not Thrown in With Trump","In a recent New York Magazine article, prominent political commentator Jonathan Chait argues that libertarians have largely come around to supporting Trump, despite some previous doubts:

When Donald Trump first emerged as a genuine threat to seize the Republican nomination, Charles and David Koch represented the epitome of elite right-wing opposition to the populist interloper…. The latest development in the relationship between the Kochs (right-wing heirs to a business fortune) and Trump (also the right-wing heir to a business fortune) is that the former have thrown the weight of their massive organization unhesitatingly behind the latter. Largely satisfied with Trump's conservative judicial appointments, lax regulation of business, and regressive tax cutting, the Kochs are spending several hundred millions of dollars to protect the Republican majority. Whatever points of contention remain between the two have been reduced to squabbles between friends. The Koch rapprochement mirrors a broader trend: Among the conservative intelligentsia — where resistance to Trump has always run far deeper than it has among the Republican rank and file — libertarians have displayed some of the greatest levels of friendliness to the Trump administration.

Chait reaches this conclusion only by completely ignoring several of the nation's leading libertarian organizations and intellectuals, and the positions they have taken on the administration. The only libertarian critics of Trump he mentions are those associated with the Niskanen Center, which he describes (with some justice) as having moved away from traditional libertarian positions on many economic issues, and therefore not very representative of libertarians generally.

He does not even discuss the Cato Institute—by far the best known libertarian think tank or Reason (the nation's most prominent libertarian magazine and website). Cato and Reason writers such as Alex Nowrasteh and Shikha Dalmia have been among the toughest and most prominent critics of Trump's attacks on immigration. Others at both organizations have been harshly critical of the administration on trade, government spending, civil liberties, executive power (Gene Healy, Cato's leading expert on this subject, has argued that Trump should be impeached), health care reform, and a good many other issues.

Rep. Justin Amash, probably the most libertarian member of Congress, has also been one of the most thoroughgoing GOP critics of Trump. The same goes for libertarian-leaning GOP Senator Jeff Flake. Chait cites Ron Paul and Rand Paul as examples of libertarian-leaning politicians who have ""staunchly defended the president."" I am, to understate the point, no great fan of Ron Paul. But Chait is simply wrong about his take on Trump. Paul has been consistently negative about the president, whose economic and foreign policies he recently denounced in the course of an interview in where he also expressed the hope that Trump will be vulnerable in the 2020 GOP primaries.

Unlike his father, Rand Paul, in my view, has indeed been overly friendly with the administration on some issues. And he has gotten - and deserves - considerable libertarian criticism for actions such as voting to confirm Jeff Sessions as attorney general. But he has also publicly attacked it on important issues like sentencing, electronic surveillance, marijuana legalization, and others. It is entirely fair to criticize Rand Paul for being too soft on Trump. But it is also important to recognize that he has been at odds with the president considerably more often than most members of Congress typically oppose an administration of their own party.

The main villains of Chait's piece (as of many other recent left-wing attacks on libertarians) are the Koch brothers - the libertarian billionaires who fund a variety of political and social causes. It is indeed true that they plan to spend a lot of money trying to maintain GOP majorities in Congress. I think they are wrong to do so. In addition to imposing tougher constraints on Trump, the return of divided government is desirable from a libertarian point of view, because divided government tends to reduce government spending relative to unified government.

It does not follow, however, that the Kochs have ""thrown the weight of their massive organization unhesitatingly behind"" Trump. Far from it. In addition to spending money on congressional races, the Kochs have also, in recent months, devoted extensive resources to lobbying Congress to protect DACA recipients without simultaneously reducing legal immigration (the latter, of course, a major priority of Trump's), protecting immigrants more generally, opposing Jeff Sessions' efforts to expand the War on Drugs, and promoting criminal justice reform of a sort that is largely the opposite of the administration's philosophy.

I am obviously not privy to the Kochs political calculations. But it is possible they believe that, given various tensions between the congressional GOP and Trump, supporting the former does not imply supporting the latter, and that continued GOP majorities in Congress won't do much to help Trump on those issues where he is especially odious (immigration, trade, civil liberties). It is also possible they think that - given his record unpopularity - Trump is unlikely to be reelected, and they want to maintain GOP control of Congress as a hedge against what might be a very liberal Democratic president elected in 2020. If these are indeed the Kochs' views, I have considerable reservations about them, for the reasons I noted above. But a libertarian can hold them without ""unhesitatingly"" supporting Trump, and indeed without necessarily supporting him much at all.

To say that Chait's indictment of libertarians is wrong, is not to say that all is well with the libertarian world. Some libertarians have indeed supported the administration far more than can be justified - in most cases not because of love of Trump, but because of fear of the left. At least for the moment, Bernie Sanders-style left-wing populism is gaining ground in the Democratic party, and it is understandable for libertarians to fear the rise of a movement that seeks to massively expand government control over the economy and society, especially one led by a man notorious for his praise of brutal communist regimes. Unfortunately, such fear leads some libertarians to take it easy on an administration they see as a valuable ""enemy of my enemy."" It may also account for the Kochs' overly optimistic take on the consequences of maintaining GOP control of Congress. Many libertarians (like many other people) may not realize that the administration's extensive expansion of regulation on immigration and trade increase government control over the economy and society a good deal more than its relatively limited deregulatory actions elsewhere have reduced it.

Even more troublingly, a small but vocal group of self-described libertarians have supported the administration and right-wing ""blood and soil"" nationalism not as a lesser evil, but as a positive good. In my view, and that of most mainstream libertarian intellectuals, such ideas are utterly inimical to the libertarian tradition, properly understood. But it cannot be denied that they have appeal for some people who think of themselves as libertarians, and that libertarians need to do more to counter their rise.

In sum, Chait is wrong to tar libertarians, as a group, for supposedly being thoroughgoing supporters of Trump. But it would also be wrong for libertarians to become complacent about either Trump, or the more general threat to liberty posed by the kind of nationalism he exemplifies.

I am a Cato Institute adjunct scholar (an unpaid external affiliation), and have written a number of papers for Cato, and spoken at many Cato events. I have, over the years, spoken (and sometimes gotten speaker fees) at a number of events sponsored by organizations partially funded by the Kochs, including most recently at a Cornell University panel on Trump's immigration policies that was partly sponsored by the Koch Foundation, where I argued that Trump's travel ban is unconstitutional. I have also spoken about these and other issues at events sponsored by conservative and liberal/progressive organizations, such as the American Constitution Society. If readers wish to discount what I say on these issues because of the above affiliations, they are free to do so. I will only say that I have not hesitated to differ with either the Kochs or other libertarians, over the years, and that I also have an extensive history of being highly critical of both Trump and the GOP generally.","The Koch rapprochement mirrors a broader trend: Among the conservative intelligentsia — where resistance to Trump has always run far deeper than it has among the Republican rank and file — libertarians have displayed some of the greatest levels of friendliness to the Trump administration.
It does not follow, however, that the Kochs have ""thrown the weight of their massive organization unhesitatingly behind"" Trump.

In 2018 the Maghreb does not look good at all and the hopes of its people to achieve change for democracy, good governance, accountability and rule of law are being dashed away. There is more of the same as in the past with the hope for a better tomorrow receding away inexorably. Democracy seems to be a luxury beyond people’s reach and so is good governance, for now rulers evoke the Islamist menace to favor harsh security measures which they make use of alongside to silence recalcitrant media voices and political critics and maintain the status quo.i

It is true, the Islamist menace is real, but diffuse, especially now that ISIS is gone and its canon fodder is free to go it alone as lone wolves. Even people in some countries like Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are made to believe that they are better off with strong central governments as a result of this phantom menace. As a matter of fact, in Libya security, stability and peace of mind might be favored over bread which is itself favored over democracy and rule of law. The Libyan volcano that has erupted during the defunct Arab Spring and has not stopped, in the least, spewing lava and fumes obstructing the horizon and, what is more, the magma has not solidified yet and probably won’t for quite sometime in the future.

The Maghreb In The Throes Of Uncertainty

The Maghreb, more than ever, is in the throes of uncertainty about its identity, its political future and its economy. Is the Maghreb Amazigh, Arab or none or both? One thing is sure it doesn’t consider itself African because in the popular belief and, also, in that of the politicians who of course don’t show it, this part of Africa is white and thus close to Europe more, and to be African is to be black. So, the identity entanglement is not resolved.ii

Morocco and Algeria have officially recognized the Amazigh/Berber culture and language but it seems merely to pay lip service to the cultural cause of the Amazighs/Berbers people, no more. Libya, on the other hand does not recognize, in the least, its Amazighs/Berbers, it thinks of itself purely Arab and fully Muslim.

The most important and crucial issues of the region are, also, still up in the air. Women are, as ever, second to men, gender equality is but an empty slogan used to please the West. The women are not fully empowered bearing in mind that illiteracy is still high among females especially in the countryside. Patriarchy and tribalism plus faulty religious interpretation is keeping them under the control of men and society.

The youth have no better deal, they started the Arab Spring in Tunisia to put an end to gerontocracy rule and instead of bringing change they allowed Islamists to take over power and, as a result, there is zero change for them. The Maghreb does not like its youth recalcitrant and modernistic in thought and belief. It prefers them obedient, regimented, quiet and subservient to the establishment and omnipresent tradition and religion.

In the Maghreb, also, minorities are still repressed overtly or covertly and as such they still live in the closet. Gays and all LGBT are not welcome in public space. Worse for some people they are dangerous because they carry moral and clinical diseases and they have been “planted” in the world of Islam by the secular West to destroy the fabric of Muslim society. So they are a true danger not to say a real fifth column.

In the Maghreb poverty is still predominant in spite of the fact that some countries have benefited at some point in history from the oil bonanza. The distribution of wealth is unequal and as such the poor are getting poorer and the rich richer. So, basically in each country there are two countries cruising at different speeds and if subsidies are reduced or literally scraped turmoil will ensue undoubtedly, and it will happen in the long run.

The Maghreb Arab Union — MAU 0- (Union du Maghreb Arabe –UMA-), a regional organization for cooperation and development exists on paper only since 1998. It has not functioned ever because Morocco and Algeria are estranged as a result of the Sahara conflict. For Morocco’s monarch, UMA is deadiii and to prove that he is attempting to join other African regional organizations and is successfully taking Moroccan business and expertise to Africa.iv

The Maghreb is not in good shape, and 2018 does not look good for it especially in Algeria and Libya, this, however, does not mean that Morocco and Tunisia are better off, but they are in somewhat better disposition for now, not to forget, that the predominant situation might change overnight without prior warning in these two countries.

All in all, the Maghreb is not democratic and is still totalitarian, does not like is minorities, still oppresses its women and youth and its countries refuse to shake hands because of tribal feuds. So, it seems that it’s future is bleak, for now, and probably more so in 2018.

Algeria Is On The Verge Of Explosion

Algeria is in a bad shape, to say the least. Its oil revenues are next to nothing, it has resorted to printing paper money to pay its functionaries. As result, the inflation will run higher and higher and ultimately the country will have to resort to the very unpopular measures that it is resisting ferociously, so far, to safeguard its independence, mainly:

Borrow money from world financial institutions:

Call in the World Bank to restructure its finance and shore up its ailing economy;

Cut popular subsidies;

Put an end to state privileges given to senior officials;

Open doors for international trade and business;

Adopt a competitive stance in the economy; etc.

Besides the economy, the political system is in a dead end: the army is firmly in power behind an incapacitated president in a wheelchair and unable to talk or lead the country. But he is kept in place by the military to safeguard their political and economic interests and scare away the Islamists and dissuade them from returning to the political arena.

Algeria is bad as it is now and any unpopular action on the part of the government to restructure the economy will draw fire from the people and will probably lead to a delayed Algerian Spring.v

Algeria is in bad shape and cutting the huge present subsidies will bring the masses into the streets with the stark illusion that they would be able to restore these privileges, but, alas, economic reality will not allow that, in the least. Algeria’s present resources cannot allow the état providence any longer. People have to earn fully their daily bread and not get it half price from the government.

However, if Algeria cannot have bread, as it used to do, it would want to have democracy and that would mean the end of the rule of the military. Would the military accept that or come out in the open as a true dictatorship and face up to the people?

Any popular uprising could potentially, also, lead to a civil war anew and to more suffering for the people like in the past.

Morocco: Incremental Democracy Is No More

Mohammed VI is slowly but surely regaining control of all the prerogatives he gave up in the light of the Constitution of 2011. As of now he is the only maître à bord. The recalcitrant press has been muzzled and economically stifled and journalists put in prison or pushed to leave the country if they refuse to toe the official line.

Political dissent has been repressed harshly a case in point is the Hirak of the Rif that had been dealt with violently and its leadership imprisoned with rumors of torture. Another uprising is slowly making its way to the surface in the eastern city of Jerrada, once upon the time the capital of coal mining in the country. Already the perss is dubbing it the Hirak of Jerrada. The two uprisings are duly taking place in areas totally neglected by the central government and do belong to the Morocco of Despair (the periphery) as opposed to the nursed and rich Morocco of the Golden Traingle (the center: the triangle of Agadir, Tangier and Fes.)

The uprising of the Rif is probably the most serious crisis that the monarchy had to grapple with since the Arab Spring turmoil. It took place in area that has been traditionally inamicable to the Makhzen, in almost a century.

The crisis of the Rif has shown to the world that Morocco is indeed two Moroccos: one rich (the center) and one poor (the periphery) or to put it in other words: Morocco of the Golden Triangle made of the coastal cities and the rich plains and the Morocco of Despair made of the mountainous areas and arid lands.

In spite of the above, the monarchy remains popular among the people because it is the symbol of national unity past and present.

In reaction to the Hirak grievances, the monarch has launched an accountability campaign to cleanse the administration from sluggish bureaucrats. So far, many officials have either been fired or forced to go in retirement, but none tried.vi

Politically speaking the monarch has returned the country to The African Union after several years and is even trying to join other regional organizations to chuck out the Polisario Front from this continent.

On the economic front, Mohammed VI has been successful in opening the African markets to Moroccan business: banks, insurance, telecom, power, aviation, energy, mining, investment, building , etc. and signing hundred of trade agreements with many governments.

This Moroccan economic onslaught on Black Africa has four salient objectives:

Serve a springboard to Moroccan business to go continental and project Moroccan economic might and expertise; Serve as a beachhead for European and American multinationals based in Morocco; Serve Moroccan national interests in Western Sahara and isolate, by so doing, the Polisario and its staunch protector and bloodline: Algeria; and Serve Moroccan political interests in the continent and spread Moroccan Islam, known to be soft and Sufi, to fight extremism.

Mohammed VI has been very nimble in dealing with Islamism since the advent of the Arab uprisings in 2011, thanks to the Constitution of 2011, he allowed the flagship of Moroccan Islamists, the moderate Parti du Développement et Justice –PJD- to lead the government quietening the critics of the monarchy and by so doing giving the coup de grâce to the 20 Février Moroccan Arab Spring movement.

In 2017, the Islamists won again the general elections and though they had more seats than before, yet they were on the wane internationally. Taking note of this important element the monarch got rid of the vociferous and mercurial head of the PJD, Benkirane and replaced him by the amenable, quiet and composed shrink Al Othmani as head of the government in which Akhennouch, a close friend of the king played a major part. So, the Islamists lead the government, but the palace rules the country, stronger than ever.

In the meantime, the king has successfully strengthened his role of amir al-mu’minin (Commander of the Faithful) nationally and internationally by creating the Imam Academy, with the mission to form moderates clerics for Morocco and the rest of the worldvii and, also, founding an association of African Ulemas to propagate moderate Islam in Africa and isolate Islamism.

Tunisia And The Phantom Menace Of Jihadism

While Morocco and Algeria have both a strong security apparatus that defeated Islamism and created a strong centralized state, Tunisia is proving to be the weak part of the chain. The Arabs certainly owe Tunisia the inception of the Arab Spring that swept away dictatorships in no time and brought either theocracies to power or led civil wars and restlessness.

Tunisia’s uprising chased the dictator Ben Ali in no time, and brought the Islamist Ennahda to power by ballot boxes and got rid of them by the same means, but has been unable to get rid of the menace of violent Salafists who struck at the country several times creating tremors of fear that reached the heart of the country’s economy: tourism that is the most important money earner for Tunisia. Before the Arab Spring Tunisia was a big tourist attraction for Europe for several reasons, its proximity to the European continent, its cheap resort sites, its political stability and welcoming culture and people, but, alas, tourism, very much like capital, gets scared easily by chaos and restlessness.

After, the strong dictator Ben Ali, and the controversial and fundamentalist Ennahda under which Salafism grew in strength, extremism and determination, the actual party in power Nida’ Tounes, is not a homogeneous political structure, instead it looks like many tribes in one body with different agendas and worldly goals, one of these tribes being the supporters of Ben Ali, who certainly hold a grudge against democratic forces which they consider responsible for the actual weakness of the government, the country and the economy.

As if Tunisia did not have enough worries of its own, its proximity to restless Libya makes its life more difficult and adds to the atmosphere of uncertainty and instability in the country.

Tunisia stands alone and fragile in the Maghreb, whereas it would have certainly benefited greatly from a strong and healthy Maghreb Union, today it is isolated as a result of the ongoing political feud between Morocco and Algeria, it is condemned to navigate the politics of this region with much caution for fear to trigger the wrath of one of the two strong central countries of the region. This tight-rope walking is undoubtedly adding to its structural weakness immensely.

All in all, the future looks very uncertain for Tunisia at the time being and only an outburst of national pride and feeling of togetherness and help from the outside world can push forward this beautiful country that gave birth to the Arab Spring and Arab hope for democracy but got instability in return.

The Libyan Conundrum

Libya has ceased to exist as a single, strong and proud country with the death of its dictator Qaddafi. The Arab Spring brought only restlessness, war and insecurity.viii The country has not been able to unite even with the help of the UN that brokered an agreement in the coastal city of Skhirat, Morocco in 2015. The war lords of the country are: the Islamists based in Tripoli, heavily armed but lacking political wisdom, the secularists in the east led by a carefree retired marshal whose only concern is to obliterate Islamism and rule the country with a strong fist. As for the south it is tribalist in soul and spirit, using power for material benefits.

The blatant weakness of Libya has tempted ISIS, at its height to take control of the country to use as a base for terrorist attacks in Europe, but though this wish and dream has receded for the time being, yet the country is a base for clandestine immigration to the European Eldorado and its war lords certainly use this card to make much-needed money and scare continental Europe and especially Italy.

As of today, Libya is not a country but a loose confederation of tribes of different nature and objective:

The Islamist entity that wants to rule the country by shari’a and create some sort of a caliphate, but since Islamism is on the wane internationally and the West is determined, under Trump, to put an end to it, its survival in such a hostile environment is almost impossible though it tries to put a modernist face to its project; The trigger-free secularists of the east are a pale copy of Arab military dictatorships that have been scratched from existence by the Arab Spring and undeniably such systems of government are a thing of the past and can in no way lead a nation in search of freedom and democracy. The materialistic tribes of the south: the tribes of the south seek material gain, no more no less. They once imprisoned Seif al-Islam Qaddafi and are propping him up now to become the next leader of the countryix and his chances are pretty high because most of the people regret the era of the dictator Qaddafi. True, he was harsh ruler with the opposition but he treated the people nicely, distributing to them directly the revenues of oil: free housing, free education, free health services and plenty of cash handouts and most importantly he guaranteed peace, security and order. If things go normally during the upcoming elections, the Qaddafis will return to power with the son of the late dictator Seif, educated in the West and open to democracy and state of law and order, but in the meantime Libya is still a volcano in activity spewing deadly lava around and it is a true failed state.x

The Maghreb And Europe

The Maghreb has been and still is the soft belly of Europe. If it catches cold, Europe sneezes and coughs and goes sick. Over the centuries the relations between Europe and the Maghreb had been intense and tense. In the 8th century an Amazigh/Berber general Tariq Ibnou Zayad, the man after whom Gibraltar is named, crossed the strait and installed Amazigh/Berber and Arab rule of Spain for seven centuries ending in 1492, at the fall of Granada as a result of the Reconquista. In return, Spain invaded Morocco and took the presidios of Ceuta and Mellilia which are still under Spanish control today. The Arabs also, colonized Scilia and left quite an imprint on its culture.

Starting in the 19th century, southern Europe (France, Spain and Italy) progressively colonized North Africa for resources and manpower and left quite an indelible imprint on the language, culture and way of life. Today most of the Maghreb is dependent on Europe for technology and culture.

Nevertheless, in spite of this dependence, Europe is not doing much to rub its democratic system of government on the Maghreb countries instead it only wants them to buy its technology and engage in trade and, most importantly, act as a gendarme to check unwanted African immigrants.

Europe is democratic and rich but also very selfish, it only cares about its well-being and in spite of its talk about democracy and human rights, yet it stands by the dictatorships in the area out of personal interest and rewarding trade and commercial ties.

Garda searching a vacant property in Dundalk close to the scene of the murder of a Japanese man.

THE GARDAÍ HAVE yet to find any established link to suggest that yesterday’s attack in Dundalk was a terrorist incident.

“At this time, we can find no established link to indicate that this tragedy is terrorist related,” the force said in a statement.

“However, enquiries are continuing internationally as the investigation develops.”

The terrorism threat level has not been changed as a result of the attack which saw one man, Japanese national Yosuke Sasaki, stabbed to death and two others injured.

The level remains at “moderate” – meaning an attack is possible but not likely.

Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan this afternoon expressed his sympathy with those affected by yesterday’s attacks.

“I want to thank gardaí in Dundalk who responded to the attacks. An arrest was made yesterday morning shortly after the attacks took place and a young Egyptian man remains in custody,” Flanagan said.

There has, understandably, been speculation and concern about the motivation for this attack. I welcome An Garda Síochána’s statement in this regard and would caution against drawing judgements until gardaí can establish the facts in the course of their investigation.

“The gardaí are carrying out a full and urgent investigation into these attacks, and that must be allowed to take its course.”

He said that, as this is a live criminal investigation, nothing should be said that would impinge on that investigation.

The investigation has yet to find any connection between the alleged attacker, an 18-year-old Egyptian man, and the Co Louth town.

The suspect previously spoke to gardaí about seeking asylum in Ireland, on New Year’s Day, but officers said he showed no signs of erratic behaviour at that time.

It is understood he travelled to Northern Ireland on a ferry from Scotland before moving into the Republic.

Reports of sexual assault by peacekeepers in conflict zones have been rife for years, but have only recently been taken seriously by the UN. The problem is systemic, and anybody who has worked in development or as part of an emergency response is unlikely to be surprised that some NGO workers were found to be paying for sex.

But by singling out Oxfam as lacking in “moral leadership”, the British government eschews the more uncomfortable question of how to address reports of this nature across the industry, and beyond.

The accusations emerged amid a growing movement that recognizes the pervasive nature of sexual violence across the world and challenges misogynistic organizational cultures. Unlike other sectors where allegations of misconduct have led to calls for reform, the response here has been to suggest funding cuts to the industry as a whole.

Government representatives and media pundits who argue that the UK cannot afford to send money abroad, or that it cannot ensure taxpayer money is used effectively, see this scandal as a confirmation of their reservations.

The truth is that the way development is currently understood in the West has made it impossible to talk about the industry’s inequality problem—both when it comes to aid workers’ conduct and in terms of justifying overseas aid.

Mirage of morality

With its fundraising appeals and glossy project reports, the development industry was built entirely around an image of morality. Campaigns appeal to our instincts to do what is right in the face of ills such as poverty, war and famine. These images are powerful and necessary to mobilize support for the important work that organizations like Oxfam do abroad.

With its fundraising appeals and glossy project reports, the development industry was built entirely around an image of morality.

However, they hide from view the ways in which these projects operate in situations of sustained disparity, such as the way the presence of Western aid workers in countries such as Sierra Leone or South Sudan reflects broader global inequalities. Because giving aid is portrayed as unassailably the moral thing to do, it becomes impossible to talk about how it reproduces racial and gender inequalities, for example through staggering pay gaps between local and international staff.

The sex work economies that appear around the deployment of rich Western humanitarian workers are an extreme example of the power that those workers yield against beneficiaries living in conditions of poverty. To defend the value of foreign aid from constant attack, the industry has placed itself on a moral pedestal, so that when individual aid workers fall off, the value of the entire project is put in question.

But while inequality is inherent in the development project, this should not to provide fodder to those who would have it scrapped. Quite the contrary: it is an appeal to be more realistic about what development is and why foreign aid matters. Both supporters and detractors of foreign aid steer clear of placing it in its historical context, emerging in the shadow of Western imperialism.

Righting historical wrongs

The problems faced by developing countries are rarely seen as products of colonial experiences and the distorting effects that imperial ventures had on colonized societies and economies, despite plenty of evidence to that effect. Not only that, Western powers’ current wealth is linked to the profits made in the colonies.

Talking about development as disinterested charity or the goodwill of Western governments misrepresents the historical responsibility of aid-giving countries such as the UK or France towards former colonies.

Aid should be seen as a form of reparation for past wrongs. This would help reframe the conversation about its value—alongside broader arguments about global citizenship. It would also help to question the ways in which developing countries continue to be kept poor by international economic policies and how much of British development aid in fact makes its way back into the British economy.

The Oxfam scandal is not surprising to those in the industry, but it is disturbing. Staff will be disciplined, and Oxfam will have to consider its practice, but the scandal also offers the opportunity to start talking more frankly about the role of foreign aid in an unjust world.

We must dig deeper than individual aid workers’ misconduct to tackle underlying questions of inequality and power—a first step towards making the industry more just, rather than questioning its value.

Barnaby Joyce said he will step down Monday as leader of the National party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s center-right coalition, after resisting earlier calls to quit over the affair with his former media secretary, with whom he is expecting a child.

He will remain in parliament, safeguarding Turnbull’s shaky one-seat majority.

Joyce’s decision came after a falling-out with Turnbull, who is in the United States for meetings with President Donald Trump and who declined to leave him in charge while he is out of the country.

FILE - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce reacts as he sits behind Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Oct. 24, 2017.

Joyce, a practicing Catholic, has been married for 24 years and has campaigned on family values. He said he decided to quit after an allegation of sexual harassment emerged Friday.

He denied any wrongdoing but acknowledged the allegation had hastened his decision.

“I will say on Monday morning at the party room I will step down as the leader of the National Party and deputy leader of Australia,” Joyce said.

Joyce, whose support base rests in Australia’s traditionally conservative rural areas, wore his trademark Akubra bushman’s hat as he spoke to journalists in Armidale, the farming town he represents about 485 km (300 miles) northeast of Sydney.

Little-known outside Australia, Joyce made international headlines in 2015 when he deported two dogs brought into Australia by U.S. actor Johnny Depp without the proper paperwork, a row that became known as the “war on terrier.”

The National Party will now elect a new leader, who will also become deputy prime minister under the terms of the coalition agreement with Turnbull’s Liberal party.

Joyce’s resignation will potentially heal the rift between the Liberal and National parties, a political alliance that has existed for nearly 100 years.

Nick Economou, senior lecturer in Australian politics at Monash University in Melbourne, however said it would have been impossible for both Turnbull and Joyce to return to parliament next week after their public falling-out.

“In Australian politics, disunity is death,” Economou said. Two-thirds of Australian voters wanted Joyce to resign, The Australian newspaper’s Newspoll showed earlier this week.","He will remain in parliament, safeguarding Turnbull’s shaky one-seat majority.

I was there to meet with civilian victims of the decade-and-a-half-long conflict there – from both pro- and anti-government activities – and to press the US and Afghan governments to better protect the civilian population.

Trips to the field to meet with the people who live and breathe the conflict make me a better advocate. Their stories stay with me, whether I’m in congressional offices or Starbucks.

My daughter was standing on a low shelf. The weight of her winter jacket pulled her off balance and she fell, hard. Thankfully, she wasn’t hurt, but for hours afterward she pointed at herself, saying “head.”

In a flash, I was back in Afghanistan, talking with an 8-year-old girl name Shabnam in Kabul. She was the most seriously injured of her family when their house was destroyed in a strike by US forces responding to a Taliban-led attack at the nearby airport. Her short hair had begun to grow back but the scars on her head were still starkly visible. She spoke clearly, pointing to her head and other injured parts of her body as she described what happened. Moments earlier, her grandfather had shown us their now-shattered home. In the rubble I spotted bits of lace, a notebook, a pair of shoes – the things you leave behind when things no longer matter.

Everyone acknowledges that Shabnam’s home should not have been hit. She was thankfully in a major city and able to get medical care quickly. Physically, she will recover. Other stories from the escalating US air war in Afghanistan are more complex. A few hours east of Kabul, in Jalalabad, sits another girl, Rozina, 17 – the sole survivor of an August airstrike that killed six women and children in her family.

Rozina and her family members had fled their home in Haska Mena District, knowing that air strikes against Daesh (ISIS) were imminent. Rozina’s leg was crushed when the vehicle was hit. She was unable to move and watched her relatives – including a toddler around my daughter’s age – die around her. Eventually an elderly woman from the nearby village arrived with a wheelbarrow and carted Rozina to her home, where her family members found her the next day and took her to Jalalabad.

The US said it had destroyed a vehicle loaded with militants and munitions. “The strike was conducted in the middle of open terrain. There was zero chance of civilian casualties,” said a US military spokesman.

Rozina’s story was like so many others I heard in Jalalabad, of people trying to live their lives despite the threat of the Taliban, of Daesh, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The stories start to blur together. Was it two grandfathers or three who were killed after sending their families to hide while staying back to secure their land and livestock? Which family got an apology from the district governor, and a modest sum to help rebuild? Which one never heard back from any government official, despite lodging numerous complaints?

However, time and time again, local residents told us US soldiers had been operating on the ground in the days and hours before the bombing, and US planes had been flying overhead. When we asked how these people knew the soldiers were American they laughed. After 16 years of this war, Afghans know how to identify foreign forces.

The Afghans we spoke with knew that civilians were dying in airstrikes. “When they kill civilians they say [they] killed Daesh,” said one man who lost his father in an airstrike. “When they kill Daesh they say they want to bring peace.” Many Afghan civilians said they were tired of bearing the brunt of this conflict. They are also attacked by insurgents, but when government forces kill civilians, it undermines civilian support for the government and for international forces working alongside it. “If Deash can control the area, we would say welcome, or if Taliban or America and can bring peace, please let them,” the man who lost his father told me. “Let people run their lives safely.”

A major examination of airstrike data by the New York Times suggests that, in Iraq and Syria, civilian casualties were far higher than admitted, and that US targeting practices were inadequate to limit them in line with US obligations under the laws of war. The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan reported a decrease in civilian casualties from pro-government forces’ ground operations in the first nine months of 2017, but a 52 percent increase in civilian casualties as a result of air operations (with 205 deaths and 261 injuries). These numbers reflect casualties from US military strikes as well as those by the Afghan forces the US is charged with training and advising, and from US covert operations, which are not publicly acknowledged.

The US eventually claimed that Rozina’s vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device, though the district police chief says there was only one explosion in the area that day, and the US did claim responsibility for a strike against militants that day. Rozina told us that her family’s vehicle was hit moments after she saw planes flying overhead. In November, the UN took the unusual step of publicly rejecting, via Twitter, US claims that no civilians were killed in a US attack in Kunduz that day, while the US doubled down on its claim that its investigation confirmed no civilian deaths.

At the very least, these accounts should raise doubts about the thoroughness of US investigations. In recent days, the US Central Command took to Twitter, touting the arrival of new air assets and saying, “The Taliban still has not felt the full brunt of U.S. and #Afghan air power.” For too many Afghan civilians, though, more air power means a greater chance of being caught between US strikes and militant activity on the ground.

Unless the US and its Afghan counterparts make a more concerted effort to reduce civilian casualties in their military operations, they will have little to say when the very people they are trying to protect say they will accept Taliban or Daesh control in exchange for peace.

Andrea J. Prasow is deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch.","There was zero chance of civilian casualties,” said a US military spokesman.
“When they kill civilians they say [they] killed Daesh,” said one man who lost his father in an airstrike.
“When they kill Daesh they say they want to bring peace.” Many Afghan civilians said they were tired of bearing the brunt of this conflict.
They are also attacked by insurgents, but when government forces kill civilians, it undermines civilian support for the government and for international forces working alongside it.

almost a year ago Trump signed a bill rolling back Obama measure making it harder for mentally ill to get guns — Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) February 15, 2018

A year ago today, the Senate rolled back an Obama regulation that would have prevented 75,000 severely mentally ill people from buying guns and put them ""in the hands of people too mentally unstable to manage their own bank accounts"" wrote @cliffschecter https://t.co/57YCKPDiqf — The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) February 15, 2018

None of this is a remotely accurate description of what happened. A year ago, Congress and Trump eliminated a proposed rule that would have included in the federal government gun background database people who received disability payments from Social Security and received assistance to manage their benefits due to mental impairments.

This is a regulation that potentially deprived between 75,000 to 80,000 people of a right based not on what they had done but on the basis of being classified by the government in a certain way. The fact that these people may have these impairments did not inherently mean that they were dangerous to themselves or others and needed to be kept away from guns.

As I noted when the regulation was repealed last March, this rule violated not just the Second Amendment but the Fourth, because it deprived the affected people of a right without due process. The government does have the power to restrict and even deny gun ownership to people, but it has to show that these people have engaged in behavior that makes weapons dangerous in their hands.

That's why the regulation was opposed not just by National Rifle Association (NRA) but by several mental health and disability groups and by the American Civil Liberties Union. Pundits largely ignored the latter groups' opposition to the rule, preferring to play up the power of the NRA and their influence on Republicans to turn the issue into a partisan fight.

It was hackery then, and it is still hackery today. It's shameful to ignore the serious constitutional problems of this poorly conceived rule just to sow panic and implicate one's political opponents.","In the wake of yesterday's deadly school shooting in Florida, President Donald Trump tweeted that there were signs that alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz was ""mentally disturbed.""

In fact, it showed he was a sober, healthy 64-year-old.

The report — released Friday in response to a lawsuit by The Associated Press and the Las Vegas Review-Journal — showed gunman Stephen Paddock had anti-anxiety drugs in his system but was not under the influence of them.

Paddock unleashed a barrage of bullets from his high-rise hotel suite into a crowd at a country music festival below, killing 58 people and injuring more than 800 others on Oct. 1. He fatally shot himself before officers stormed his hotel suite after the mass shooting.

The autopsy showed the 6-foot-1 (1.8 meters) Paddock was slightly overweight at 224 pounds (102 kilograms), had high blood pressure and bad teeth. But there was nothing unusual in his physical condition, even after a microscopic brain examination conducted by experts at Stanford University. His cremated remains were released to his brother in January.

Earlier Friday, Clark County District Judge Richard Scotti issued an unusual order to The AP and Review-Journal that an autopsy report about an off-duty police officer killed in the mass shooting, which was released by another judge last week, must be returned. The AP and Review-Journal are appealing.

The motivation for the shooting has been a mystery since Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel, despite intensive investigation by local police and federal authorities.

A preliminary report released last month by Las Vegas police said the high-stakes gambler had been on a losing streak, was obsessed with cleanliness, possibly bipolar and was having difficulties with his live-in girlfriend.

Investigators believe Paddock acted alone and he did not leave a suicide note or manifesto before he was found dead in the room. Police found 23 rifles and a handgun in his hotel suite and more than a dozen of the rifles were fitted with “bump stock” devices that allowed rapid-fire shooting similar to fully automatic weapons.

His live-in girlfriend, Marilou Danley, told investigators that Paddock had become “distant” in the year before the shooting and their relationship was no longer intimate, according to the preliminary report released in January.

Danley had described him as germophobic and told investigators he had reacted strongly to smells. Paddock told his friends and relatives that he always felt ill, in pain and fatigued, the report said.

His doctor suspected he may have had bipolar disorder but Paddock had refused to discuss that possibility, he doctor told police. The doctor offered him antidepressants but Paddock would only accept a prescription for anxiety medication. Paddock was fearful of medication and often refused to take it, the doctor told investigators.

In addition to ordering The AP and Review-Journal to return copies of Officer Charleston Hartfield’s autopsy on Friday, the judge also barred the media organizations from further reporting on the autopsy’s details.

Sridevi : Curious case of an actress demise, know the complete time line | Oneindia News

There has been a dramatic turn of events over the past 50 hours following the death of actress Sridevi. It was reported at first that she had died of a cardiac arrest, but on Monday the cause of the death was stated to be due to accidental drowning.

As the Dubai Public Prosecution begins its probe into the case, reports of Sridevi's husband, Boney Kapoor being questioned by the police have been termed as false. Only a testimony was provided by Kapoor, media reports state. There was only a conversation between the police and him after the body was discovered in the bathtub of room number 2201 at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel in Dubai.

While it was reported that the body of the actress would reach Mumbai on Monday, investigations in Dubai have further delayed the process. The Khaleej Times reported that the public prosecution will conduct further investigations into the matter. The circumstances that led to her drowning would be probed.

The probe would also focus on whether there was any criminal motive. However, for now, no clear criminal motive has been found. The laboratory tests have revealed that she had consumed alcohol and was in an inebriated state when she slipped and fell into the bathtub which was filled with water, the Khaleej Times also reported. The body of the late actress has been at the General Department of Forensic Evidence, Dubai since 2.30 am on Sunday.

The Dubai Media Office Twitter account posted: ""Dubai police assert that the case file was forwarded to the Public Prosecutor's Office in Dubai to take the necessary legal action in accordance with such cases."" At 6 pm Monday, the case was still referred to the public prosecution for further investigation.

By John Damian Adizie

One question that has remained unanswered is “Are we really one?” If we are one why do we still have the media advert “attendance is strictly by invitation.” Are those not invited born of a woman?

Why is it that the children of the rich cannot attend the same school with the children of the poor? If we are really one why do rich parents object to the marriage union with children of the poor?

If we are one why is it that special seats are reserved for special people in our churches? If we are really one why are there so much discri-minations in our world today?

Incidentally, the UN has declared March 1 as Zero Discrimination Day. At first, I kept asking myself, is it really possible? Can we really have zero discrimi-nation in a world where the rich are getting richer whereas the poor are gett-ing poorer?

The gap bet-ween the poor and the rich keep widening. Can we real-ly talk of zero discrimina-tion in a world where lead-ers value the lives of cows more than their fellow human beings? Can we talk of zero discrimination in a world where the rich have a direct access to medication in any part of the world whereas the poor could not even afford ordinary tablet in their country of origin? Can we celebrate zero discrimination day in a society where the pro-perties belonging to the poor are destroyed and even taken away by the government without any compensation? What exactly are we cele-brating?

Discrimination has caus-ed a lot of havoc in our world today. The UNAIDS declar-es that discrimination un-dermine efforts to achieve a more just and equitable world. Last week during the World Social Day, we defin-ed a just society as a society where every member of the society is carried along with equal respect and dignity. It is a society where citizens are given equal opportunity and access. Discrimination, on the other hand, causes pain and suffering for many. it is a serious crime against humanity. Current discri-mination include:

Age Discrimination: has to do with the rejection of people, especially their ser-vices, due to their age. Old parents are abandoned in villages due to their age. In Nigeria, there has been claims that the youths are not carried along in politics and other decision making.

Racial Discrimination: Racism has to do with the treatment of people in a bias and unfavorable way due to their race or color.

Disability Discrimina-tion: are those who are legally and illegally depri-ved of performing tasks due to physical, mental and even spiritual incapability.

Gender Discrimination: Most African society see women as weaker sex or even as second class citi-zens. Women are denied of basic rights, such as the ri-ghts of inheritance.

Caste Discrimination: An outcast is someone who is rejected and excluded from home or society due to religious or cultural belief. The last thing a freeborn can do in Igboland of Nigeria is to get married to an osu out-cast. The western civilization and even Christianity have not succeeded in wiping out the marital discrimination against the osu outcasts.

Financial Discrimination: As the gap between the rich and the poor widens, so also the discrimination against the poor increases. The rich have little or no business with the poor. They hardly mingle with them. They do not even allow their children to attend the same school with the poor. Marriage between the rich and the poor is often seen as an abomination.

Political Discrimination: With the modern day system of government, almost every society has an opposition party. The gap between the ruling party and the opposi-tion party is so wide that at times one wonders if they are really members of the same nation.

Religious Discrimination: The current crisis in Nigeria is largely as a result of reli-gious discriminations. There is tension between Christ-ian and Muslim leaders. This discrimination is so deadly that so many people have lost their lives as a result.

Tribal and Ethnic Discri-mination: Tribalism and ethnicism are discrimi-nations that are based on people’s tribe and ethnic background.

Parental and Ancestral Discrimination: has to do with people who are discri-minated against because of their parental and ancestr-al background.

Cultural and Traditional Discrimination: One man’s meat may be another man’s poison. This is true of every cultural practices. What some people uphold as their cultural value may be an abomination in other people’s culture. In Esan land, for instance, when a woman dies she is buried in her ancestral home but in some parts of Nigeria, it is an abomination to bury a married woman in her father’s house.

As we celebrate zero dis-crimination day, every form of discrimination is hereby cancelled in Jesus name.

Amen!

28,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/84254/no_knowledge_no_power_the_fate_of_refugees_in_gozo,"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",MaltaToday,"No knowledge, no power: the fate of refugees in Gozo","Hodon is a single-mother with refugee status who moved to Gozo from Malta some months ago. When interviewed for the inaugural edition of UNHCR Malta’s magazine, she claims that the increasing cost of rent is what pushed her in this direction – a reality echoed by other migrants who spoke to the publication.

Not that the move – a ‘choice’ in only the most nominal sense of the word – is something that she regrets. “I am happy in Gozo. The people here are good. We have not been facing major problems as we were before in Malta,” she said.

But while this may be encouraging on the face of it, Hodon also hints at more deep-seated problems that refugees in general – and single-mother refugees in particular – face in Gozo.

“We want to work. We really need to work. And we want to get educated,” she says, pointing to the systemic lack of integration mechanisms on the island – of which the Head of Caritas Gozo, Michael Borg is fully aware.

“Families are leaving Malta because it is becoming increasingly expensive to live there. Even if people work, they find it more and more difficult to pay rent and support their families,” Borg said, adding that charity needs to be married to more practical long-term solutions in order for beneficial effects to be felt in the long-term across the entirety of Gozo’s social fabric.

“While charity is beautiful, we also need services that empower people. If we do not empower them, exploitation and unemployment will continue to grow. This will lead to idleness, drinking and violence. These are all signs of poverty and frustration,” Borg said.

A fragmented approach

In lieu of this, an outreach initiative by UNHCR Malta in collaboration with the Ministry for Gozo found that access to information and adequate training were among the most pressing concerns for the growing refugee population – with Somalis in particular being singled out as most vulnerable to these infrastructural gaps.

With the still-ongoing initiative having started in April 2016, the findings so far indicate that employment and education are the most urgent factors to be tackled if the integration of Gozo-based refugees is to be successful. This early assessment of the findings further specifies that, “a considerable number of refugees and migrants work casually and illegally in construction, agriculture, garbage collection, or as kitchen helpers,” and that they face further barriers through the lack of skill training and basic educational opportunities.

Many refugees have expressed a desire to learn English and Maltese, but no language classes palatable to migrants have been provided on the island so far. Similarly, while part-time courses at the Gozo branch of MCAST are open to migrants, these are given against payment, and the fees tend to be prohibitive to most refugees, rendering these skill-based courses all but inaccessible.

As such, UNHCR Malta believe that, “MCAST’s Skill Kit could provide much needed support for refugees in need of improving their basic language and other skills”.

Compounding the economic precariousness of the refugee population further are housing issues, with most refugees reporting a lack of awareness of the kind of support offered by the Housing Authority. And with rents expected to increase even in Gozo – according to the same report by UNHCR Malta – the fact that “many Gozitan landlords refuse to provide a legal rental agreement to refugees” becomes an even more acute problem.

Addressing the gaps

On the social front, UNHCR has found that there were very few activities that would encourage dialogue and cross-cultural exchange among the refugee population and local councils – with weakens the possibilities of either party being able to provide pro-active solutions to problems that might arise. The lack of social workers appointed to refugees in Gozo is also another factor that may contribute to their sense of alienation from the mainstream of Gozitan society.

“General lack of awareness and knowledge about refugees seems to give rise to misconceptions which in turn create barriers to social inclusion,” appears to be the overarching finding of the report, which was presented to Minister for Gozo Justyne Caruana in July 2017.

The report recommends that Gozo’s currently “fragmented” refugee support system be bolstered and made more cohesive through collaboration – in particular between the triumvirate of local councils, authorities and refugees who by working together, “would be able to bridge some of the current challenges faced by both refugees and communities”.

However, the report also noted that no significant health issues exist among the Gozitan refugee community, and that while “until recently, refugees in Gozo received minimal support from Jobsplus,” the employment agency has pledged to open up its services to beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection and temporary humanitarian protection in the coming year.

According to the report, in this way, “more people will benefit from assistance and gain better skills in areas such as CV writing, among others”.

Always in process, never at rest

What emerges powerfully in the same article on the UNHCR Magazine – penned by Sarah Mallia – is the basic plight of refugees being one of constant process and “flight”; that one is never allowed to be ‘at rest’. For example, a testimonial given by Hassan Yassin Ibrahim, a Somali refugee who was forced to flee his country at the age of 16, directly points to the detrimental effects of a faulty integration policy.

After being released from detention in Malta, Ibrahim traveled to Sweden, where he lived for two years, before being sent back to Malta, as per EU rules which bind asylum seekers and beneficiaries of protection to be transferred to the responsible Member State, such as the country of first entry or the country which has granted protection first.

“Refugees need support when they arrive or are transferred back to Malta. My friends who live here know very little about the Maltese people and culture,” Hassan, who has moved to Gozo on his return from Sweden, said. “Sometimes friends of mine throw litter in the street and I collect it after them. I was taught this in Sweden. They don’t know that it upsets people.”

In other words, having a ‘local’ integration policy would nip this kind of misunderstanding in the bud – a more efficient and welcoming solution than a back-and-forth trip to Sweden.

A fellow Somalian refugee interviewed for the feature also points to the frustrating state of flux that most of his number find themselves in.

“Even if we work and pay taxes in Malta, we will probably never receive a pension, or be granted citizenship. We cannot even dream about buying a house. There is no guarantee here. That is why many of us feel like we have not finished our journey,” Ahmed, a 23-year-old graphic designer, said. Lamenting the poor access to education on the island, Ahmed insists that the key to mutual understanding and communal betterment lies in communication.

“We need to organise meetings with the local communities and let them know who we are, and that we are here to help make their communities better,” Ahmed said.

The gathering sought to inspire action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at ending extreme poverty and hunger while also ensuring a healthy environment for all people and the planet.

Billed as “a new type of UN conference” devoid of “fancy suits and long speeches,” the festival featured various immersive experiences such as a virtual reality zone showing the human stories behind development challenges, in addition to workshops, demo sessions and film screenings.

Those who could not travel to Bonn were encouraged to follow the activities on UN Web TV and social media, with more than 30,000 watching the livestream while #SDGglobalFest trended across the world.

Among the festival highlights was the presentation of the UN SDG Action Awards, celebrating individuals and organizations from all regions who are working to implement the 17 goals, which have a deadline of 2030.

The awards covered seven categories, including mobilizer, storyteller and connector.

“I’m going to learn from these seven other people to create a movement and change the world,” said one of the winners, Foluke Michael of Nigeria, founder of Creative Youth Initiative Against Corruption, speaking at the closing ceremony.

His organization won the innovator category for its “Corruption Busters” campaign which targeted the general public and focused on corrupt practices associated with everyday life and how they have an impact on individuals and society.

This was the second edition of the Global Festival of Action for Sustainable Development which was hosted by the UN SDG Action Campaign with the support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Discussions revolved around five main key themes: innovative approaches, citizen engagement, communicating the SDGs, mobilizing action, and multi-stakeholder engagement.

“The world is facing tremendous challenges, and for the first time there is an innovative plan to solve them,” said Mitchell Toomey, the Global Director of the UN SDG Action Campaign.

“But we can’t do this alone, we need everyone to be part of it. We are very excited to once more bring together different key players from governments, civil society, UN agencies, cities, business, and academia in this dynamic, inclusive and innovative festival.”","Some 1,500 participants from more than 100 countries attended the three-day Global Festival of Action for Sustainable Development.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Few countries have as complicated a relationship with international aid organizations as Haiti, a small Caribbean nation wracked by structural and environmental crises. Hundreds of aid groups began arriving decades ago on a development mandate; and when a 2010 earthquake reduced large parts of its capital, Port-au-Prince, to rubble, killing around 200,000 people, it was estimated that up to 10,000 aid organizations assisted with the recovery. That same year, members of the United Nations peacekeeping mission were accused of causing a cholera outbreak, lasting seven years and claiming nearly 10,000 lives.

While most aid professionals work hard to assist their beneficiaries, last month’s Oxfam scandal lifted the lid on instances of sexual abuse and exploitation in the sector. That included cases of international NGO workers paying local women for sex, in some cases in exchange for food and other aid supplies. The scandal, sparked by a case in Haiti, caused long-precarious tensions between INGOs and locals to rise. Many in Haiti have accused the groups of operating as a de facto “state within a state,” ignoring the orders of local authorities.

“Haiti has a difficult relationship with aid … No one is surprised by this scandal, by everything that was going on,” Ralph Youri Chevry, Port-au-Prince’s mayor, told Devex in a compound outside the city center. The historical mayor’s office was destroyed in the quake and has not yet been restored. “They have long done what they want and we are now at a changing point. When I took office last year, I met with several of them and said they can’t just act without respecting us.”

Trust in INGOs — never high to begin with — is now at an all-time low. Many see the organizations as maintaining a hierarchy between foreigners and locals, and say it is time for them to show more solidarity with Haiti if their trust is to be regained.

Sabine Lamour, the director of Haitian Women Solidarity, or SOFA, a local NGO focused on women's rights, argues that the Oxfam scandal and the abuses it has uncovered is a result of a lack of respect for locals on the part of INGOs and their workers. “Perhaps international organizations could better instill a sense of their values before they come here,” she said, in SOFA’s Port-au-Prince office in a late 19th century gingerbread house — a Victorian style wooden building that survived the earthquake. “They need to better show solidarity, and exploiting the vulnerability of women, especially after the earthquake when they were on their knees, is not how you do that.”

One way INGOs could show more solidarity, Lamour suggests, is by hiring more Haitian staff. Many organizations do rely on the Haitian workforce, she said, but for lower-grade positions such as driving and clerical work. She went further to argue that some INGOs, which she refused to single out by name, perpetuate the historical slavery that Haiti revolted against in 1804. “We are locked into poverty and slavery … They don’t give enough space for Haiti to develop its own society,” she said.

The Haiti Support Group, a civil society organization that works with local groups, has also been vocal in its skepticism of the INGO community. “Aid workers regularly liaise among themselves, they hold meetings in their own language, they fly in their own people,” a recent statement given by HSG chair Antony Stewart in the wake of the scandal read. “All of this systematically excludes Haitians from any serious involvement in their own development.” He went on to allege that when problems arise, it is Haitians that are typically blamed. “If we want to start breaking down the culture of impunity within the aid sector, we need to ensure local populations are not only part of the conversation, but are leading it,” he said.

SOFA’s Lamour’s views echo those of many Haitians who have grown impatient with INGOs and their perceived inability to improve living conditions. “The idea of help from abroad is all very good,” said Maritza Saint-Dic, a street vendor on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. “But I am 30, and I have seen these people here all my life, so why isn’t anything getting better?” Dozens of other vendors, who congregate at night hawking cigarettes and beer to passers by, shared similar sentiments. “No one can act surprised by all these sex scandals; they think they are the law here,” Saint-Dic said.

Moving around Petion-Ville, a wealthy mountainside suburb popular with INGO workers and diplomats, the disparity between those who work for international organizations and ordinary Haitians is stark. SUVs and pickup trucks zoom by, emblazoned with logos. Restaurants sell hamburgers and burritos for $10, while 59 percent of Haitians earn less than $2.41 a day. Prices are listed in U.S. dollars rather than Haitian gourdes, a volatile currency. Swanky hotels have tarmacked driveways, generators, and 24-hour security, while handfuls of people sleep on the streets outside next to piles of uncollected trash.

Petion-Ville is a neighborhood where prostitution is rife. “This is where people pay the most,” one sex worker, who asked not to be named, said. “Here I can make more because foreigners pay three or four times more than locals.” She added, between calling out at passers-by, that she had not heard news of the scandal, but that she was not in the least bit shocked. “It’s part of everyday life here,” she said.

Though commonplace, sex work is illegal in Haiti. Oxfam’s internal investigation into the use of sex workers by some of its staff also concluded it could be neither substantiated nor ruled out “that any of the prostitutes were under aged.” The behavior was in breach of Oxfam’s code of conduct. Yet the incidents were not reported to local authorities. Some of the men involved in the scandal were allowed to resign instead of being sacked, and continued to work for other development organizations on international missions. Oxfam says new safeguarding measures were brought in to prevent the incidents from happening again, but aid workers like Lamour say more trust could be built if perpetrators were submitted to justice.

Laure Bottinelli, a young French-American based in Port-au-Prince, worked with Inter Aide and Solidarity International for three years before setting up Anacaona Community, a soap upcycling business with a social mission named after an indigenous chieftess killed for refusing to become a concubine for Spanish settlers. Bottinelli believes that while many INGOs do good work, many also operate under a post-emergency mandate, with a tendency to foster dependency.

“The emergency was the earthquake in 2010, and eight years later some organizations are still supposedly assisting on those grounds,” she said, adding that cholera and malnutrition are the only acute emergencies she sees in Haiti. “People still expect to be given water, rather than to treat the water in their own supplies. We should move toward structural development and away from emergency recovery.”

Bottinelli’s company employs Haitian workers, women where possible, and pays them above the average wage. “If we have 15 people working for us, we are empowering 15 people,” she said, agreeing that INGOs could work better to empower Haitians by employing more of them.

Alongside experiencing low levels of trust from Haitians, INGOs also often find themselves at odds with the government. That situation is unlikely to improve soon. President Jovenel Moïse was outspoken following the scandal, describing it as “an extremely serious violation of human dignity” on Twitter. He later went after aid agencies in general, calling for a review of the conduct of INGOs in Haiti. “The general paradigm of aid and power in Haiti, as elsewhere in the developing world, is not a balanced one,” he wrote in the Washington Post. “Our government is often sidestepped by aid agencies that refuse oversight as they pursue their own development and humanitarian agendas in our country.”

While Oxfam and other INGOs have carried out their own investigations into these incidents, for Haitians in Port-au-Prince, there is little trust they will be thorough. “They need to submit to the government, and to the weight of the law,” Lamour at SOFA said. “If they don’t, how can they expect our trust that this won’t happen again?”

32,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/23/17155596/gun-ownership-polls-safety-violence,"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vox.com,Poll: most Americans say gun ownership increases safety. Research: nope.,"Does gun ownership make you safer?

If you ask the general public, most Americans say it does. According to a new poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 58 percent of Americans agree with the statement that “[g]un ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.” In comparison, 38 percent agree with the statement that “[g]un ownership does more to reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing the chances for accidental misuse.”

This is a shift from 1999, when 41 percent of Americans agreed with the first statement and 52 percent with the second.

But if you look at the research, it seems the majority from 1999 had the right idea: Gun ownership decreases safety — on both an individual and collective level.

Individually, several studies have found that the presence of a gun in a home elevates the risk of death. A 2014 review of the research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, for instance, found that access to firearms was associated with a doubled risk for homicide and a tripled risk for suicide. A 2017 piece by Melinda Wenner Moyer in Scientific American also ran through the evidence, concluding that gun ownership was associated with a higher risk of homicide, suicide, and accidental shootings.

People often think that guns will potentially protect them from a home invader. But these kinds of events are relatively rare (and even then, the presence of a firearm can make it more likely that such a situation will escalate into deadly violence) — while the chances that a gun could be used to fatal ends in a domestic dispute, suicide, or accidental shooting are much higher, as the research on individual risk demonstrates.

This is true on a collective level as well: After controlling for other factors, higher levels of gun ownership are associated with higher levels of gun violence. Based on the research, this is one of the key reasons the US has much higher levels of gun violence than its developed peers.

More guns, more gun deaths

The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world.

The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)

Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.”

The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.

Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms.

These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.

“Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.

For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.

This chart, based on data compiled by researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations:

Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.

As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:

Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.

”A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”

This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.

Meanwhile, the research suggests that restricting access to guns helps reduce violence. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives.

And a recent review of the best US-based studies by the RAND Corporation suggested that, while much of the research is lacking, there is evidence that some gun control measures — background checks, child access prevention laws, minimum age requirements, and prohibitions associated with mental illness — are linked to reductions in injuries and deaths.

All of this suggests that gun ownership does not increase safety — and is instead a key reason that America suffers so much gun violence compared to its developed peers.

For more on gun violence in America, read Vox’s explainer.","Does gun ownership make you safer?
But if you look at the research, it seems the majority from 1999 had the right idea: Gun ownership decreases safety — on both an individual and collective level.
This is true on a collective level as well: After controlling for other factors, higher levels of gun ownership are associated with higher levels of gun violence.
Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013.
All of this suggests that gun ownership does not increase safety — and is instead a key reason that America suffers so much gun violence compared to its developed peers."

Mortars hit Cambodian peacekeeping camp in Mali, no injuries reported

Three mortars struck a Cambodian camp at the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali on Thursday morning, but no Cambodians were injured in the blasts, according to Defence Ministry spokesman Chhum Socheat.

“After checking from Mali, they have [launched] three mortars into our Cambodian camp and burned two houses,” he said, stressing there were no Cambodian casualties.

The attack occurred about 6:50am in the northern city of Kidal, or 1:50pm local time.

Socheat said mortars had also struck the French camp, but he was unsure if there were any casualties. Early reports indicate a number of explosive munitions were fired at the UN peacekeeping base.

Mali’s Prime Minister, Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga, was due to visit the city on Thursday, the first visit by a senior government official to the unstable region in just under four years.

Last year, four Cambodian peacekeepers were killed in an attack by the Christian terrorist Anti-Balaka group in the Central African Republic.

Following the deaths, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen pledged to send more peacekeepers abroad.","Cambodian peacekeepers stand at attention before being deployed to Mali in 2014.

Council Speaker makes debut at Newsmakers Series

The tale of two cities persists.

City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said that New York City is “superficially doing well,” with low unemployment levels and tourism at an all-time high, yet a good portion of its residents are impoverished.

While speaking at a gathering of community and ethnic media reporters, Johnson noted that the city’s shelter system currently houses over 61,000 people, and that one in five city residents are living in poverty.

“They’re one bad medical bill, or one lost job, away from homelessness,” he said.

“One of the things I really want to focus on is supporting, enhancing and strengthening the last remaining shreds of the social safety nets that remain here in New York City,” stated Johnson, who said he would devote attention to strengthening four institutions — the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the city’s public Heath + Hospital system and the City University of New York (CUNY).

The March 8 press briefing, the first 2018 installment of the Newsmakers Q&A series organized by the Center for Community and Ethnic Media (CCEM) at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, was moderated by Errol Louis, NY1 Political Correspondent and CUNY Journalism Professor; Debralee Santos, Editor of Manhattan Times and The Bronx Free Press; and Stephon Johnson, Staff Writer of Amsterdam News.

It was the Councilmember’s first appearance at the Newsmakers series.

In discussing diversity, Johnson acknowledged that during the recent Council Speaker’s race, many called for more diverse leadership at the head of the Council, and that several of the other Speaker candidates were African American or Latino.

“I don’t paper over that now. I don’t kind of pretend that that didn’t happen. I know that it’s a big deal,” stated Johnson. “There are sometimes it may be better for other people to speak on issues than me. It may be better for a black man or a black woman, or a Latino or a Latina, or an Asian man or an Asian woman to talk about an issue in a way that I can’t, because I don’t have that experience.”

Johnson said that Councilmember Jumaane Williams, a former Speaker candidate, is interested in researching the diversity of the workforce at city agencies.

Noting that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) publishes data on demographics of every city agency, Johnson said the Council plans to review each agency and determine which ones can do better, specifically mentioning the New York Fire Department (FDNY) as an agency he believes needed to increase diversity.

Johnson pointed out that it was the City Council’s research that discovered that about 323,000 NYCHA residents had spent time without heat or hot water during the winter, noting that the agency failed to disclose it.

While Johnson said he was disappointed in things that occurred under the leadership of NYCHA Chair Shola Olatoye, he did not call for her to resign as other Councilmembers have, saying that NYCHA’s problems are “systemic and longstanding.”

“If one person left, it would not solve the problem,” Johnson remarked.

Johnson said the Health + Hospitals (HHC) system provides vital medical services for more than 500,000 undocumented individuals that don’t have access to health insurance. He acknowledged the system’s massive budget deficit and said there might need to be hospital restructuring and managerial layoffs, adding that the hospitals will need to “get creative” in order to survive.

“They need to get people to come back for specialty care, they need to bill people who have insurance, they need to do things to raise revenue while at the same time keep up the good care,” he said.

He said that work must also be done to help support the CUNY university system.

“The vast majority of people that graduate from CUNY end up staying in New York City with a good education, and then contribute to the economy here and raise their family here,” Johnson said. “So, CUNY is a vital institution from a higher ed perspective, but also from an economic development and job perspective.”

Johnson heaped praise upon his predecessor Melissa Mark-Viverito for her work protecting the city’s immigrants and in pushing for the closure of Rikers Island. He said that the Council was successful in passing pro-immigrant legislation during Mark-Viverito’s tenure because she told Council lawyers to “find every single thing that we can possibly legislate to protect undocumented folks in New York City,” noting that about two dozen bills were passed to help the immigrant community.

Cautioning that there are limits to what the City Council can do to help immigrants, based on the actions of the federal government, Johnson said that the Council would continue “using our bully pulpit, funding organizations that protect immigrants and let them know their rights,” and doing what it can to ensure that police officers are not assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Johnson was questioned about a restructuring of the Council’s Public Engagement Unit that occurred when he first assumed the role of Speaker.

The unit had been formed in January 2016 as a joint initiative under Speaker Mark-Viverito and Mayor Bill de Blasio to more thoroughly engage multilingual and cultural media outlets and included a compiled directory “for city employees to use in outreach and informational and paid campaign efforts.”

“Half of all New Yorkers speak a language other than English at home,” said de Blasio at the time. “Almost one-sixth of all NYC households – 1.8 million people – are proficient in languages that are not English. Today we are ensuring that the city speaks the language of our people.”

In its two years, the unit also organized strategic roundtables with key municipal policymakers including the Mayor and First Lady Chirlane McCray; Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña; Health Commissioner Mary Bassett; and Office of Immigrant Affairs administrators, among others. It also issued press releases and advisory information on topics including IDNYC, Paid Sick Leave, and Pre-K For All, in various languages.

But just weeks after his January election, it was announced that as a result of an “internal reorganization at the Council under Speaker Corey Johnson,” the unit was disbanded and that Councilmember Rafael Espinal would serve as Deputy Leader of Digital Communications, a newly created position.

In his response, Johnson explained that the previous structure of the unit did not make sense to him, and said he revamped the setup so the handling of community and ethnic media requests would fall under the Council’s general communications department.

However, Johnson did not seem to be aware of the directory that the unit had compiled of ethnic media publications.

“It’s the first I’ve heard about that, but I want to make sure that this unit does even more and is more robust as a resource for community and ethnic media,” he said.

Johnson stressed that he is always available to speak to reporters, not just at press conferences, but informally around City Hall. He also pointed out that the first major interviews he did after being named Council Speaker were with community newspapers from his district.

“I don’t run from the press,” he remarked.

Discussing the city’s proposed rezonings of Inwood and Jerome Avenue, Johnson said the Council should typically seek to get to a place of acceptance if the project will benefit the community.

“My general principle is, unless the rezoning or land use action that’s proposed is totally off the wall and doesn’t make any sense, or if there is no community buy-in, which may be the case in Inwood from what I’m seeing, I try to get to a place of yes,” Johnson said.

Johnson explained that he was involved in a large rezoning project for Pier 40 in his Council district, where they were able to get $100 million for the pier and create hundreds of units of affordable and senior housing.

“I always try to get to a place of, let’s get things for the community that are meaningful, that make a difference, and will have a long-term impact,” he said.

Johnson also discussed his February 14 agreement with Mayor Bill de Blasio to replace Rikers Island with a series of community-based jail facilities located near borough courthouses.

He was questioned regarding complaints from Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. that the administration failed to engage his office and the local community before deciding on a site in the borough, located at 320 Concord Avenue.

Johnson noted that he apologized to Díaz for not including him in the discussion.

“My whole goal was to get this plan moving, to not allow there to be a long lag time,” said Johnson, who stressed that he is open to finding a different site if opposition to the Concord Avenue site remains strong.

“I’m willing to work with the Bronx delegation to find another site, but what’s more important to me is closing Rikers Island,” he said. “I’m not wedded to a particular site, I’m wedded to closing Rikers Island down and having a more modernized, humane correction system in the city of New York that has borough-based facilities.”","“I don’t run from the press”Council Speaker makes debut at Newsmakers SeriesStory by Gregg McQueenPhotos: William Alatriste | NYC CouncilThe tale of two cities persists.

This article is part of a series of stories and op-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of World Water Day on Mar. 22.

BRASILIA, Mar 21 2018 (IPS) - Confidence in large rivers and giant aquifers plummeted in many parts of the world, in the face of the expansion of water crises after intense and prolonged droughts in the last decade.

Water resources in the soil and subsoil do not hold up if the dry season lasts longer than usual for several years, as seen in several parts of Brazil and in other countries such as India, South Africa and Australia.

Brasilia, which hosts the 8th World Water Forum on Mar. 18-23, is a prime example, because no one could have imagined that the Brazilian capital, nicknamed the “birthplace of the waters” for its three large basins, would have to endure water rationing since early 2017.

“High levels of population growth, scarce investment in infrastructure and three years of below-average rainfall caused a water crisis,” said the governor of the Federal District, Rodrigo Rollemberg, at the official opening of the Forum, on Mar. 19, before highlighting works carried out by his government to ensure supply in the near future.

“Rain is the source of fresh water, sometimes moisture in the air is overlooked, because it’s not visible to the eye,” said Gerard Moss, a pilot who from 2007 to 2015 conducted the Flying Rivers project, which studied the air currents that carry water vapour through the Amazon basin.

“It is essential to maintain the rains and forests are indispensable in this sense, helping the moisture from the ocean to reach the interior of the continent. The ocean water would not travel 2,500 or 3,000 km to produce the rains that allow estate owners in Mato Grosso (in east-central Brazil) to produce two or three harvests a year,” he told IPS.

Moss’s research, which identified “flying rivers” in the Amazon rainforest that supplied several cities in Brazil, was discontinued, but it serves as a tool for the environmental education of children and adults, promoted by his wife Margi Moss, an initiative that will be moved to Europe.

Knowledge of the phenomenon of humid air currents that carry water to the rainforest provides a further argument to the theme adopted by UN-Water this year for World Water Day, which is celebrated on Mar. 22: “Nature for Water”.

UN-Water says nature-based solutions are the answer to many problems related to water, such as droughts and floods that are alternating with increasing frequency around the world, and to pollution.

Reforesting and conserving forests, restoring wetlands and reconnecting rivers with floodplains are some of its recommendations.

It’s about “not reinventing the wheel to deal with extreme weather events,” Glauco Kimura, a World Water Forum consultant, said regarding the campaign. “There is natural infrastructure, such as mangroves and other ecosystems, that help curb the impacts of hurricanes and excess rainfall,” he told IPS.

“Without forests around the springs and aquifers, there is less water, as discovered by São Paulo,” which was hit by severe shortages in 2014 and 2015, Kimura said.

To coexist with drought, the consultant recommended learning from the inhabitants of Brazil’s semi-arid Northeast, who have built tanks to collect and store rainwater to get them through the dry season. “In central and southern Brazil that culture does not exist,” he lamented.

During the drought that has lasted since 2012 in the Northeast, there has been no massive exodus of desperate people to cities to the south, where they even looted shops during earlier, less severe, droughts.

This is largely due to social programmes such as Bolsa Familia and pensions for workers and disabled people, but also to the more than one million water tanks built mainly by the Articulação no Semi-Árido Brasileiro (roughly, Networking in Brazil’s Semiarid Region – ASA), a movement of some 3,000 social organisations working on behalf of rural families vulnerable to drought.

Another example of nature-based solutions is the Cultivating Good Water Programme, promoted by Itaipú Binacional, the company that operates the second largest hydroelectric plant in the world (in terms of installed capacity), shared by Brazil and Paraguay on the Paraná River.

Some 23 million trees were planted, restoring 1,322 km of riverbank forests, and 30,000 hectares of land received protection, on the Brazilian side, said Newton Kaminski, director of coordination in Itaipu.

“The key was the river basin management, with integrated actions on all fronts, not just restoration of water sources and groundwater recharge areas. Reforestation without conservation of the soil does not bring about major results. Also necessary are social participation, education, and agriculture that does not deteriorate the soil,” Kaminsky told IPS.

The president of Cape Verde, Jorge Carlos Fonseca, stressed in his speech before nine other government leaders participating in the opening of the World Water Forum that learning to “live in symbiotic harmony with nature” was fundamental to overcoming the hunger and thirst suffered by his people in recent years because of drought.

“Preserving nature and making rational use of the resources that it provides us, changing the relation of human beings with nature,” is the lesson learned from this experience, he said. “We broke the dry season-hunger tandem,” he said.

Sea water desalination and rainwater collection contributed to the improvement of the water situation, and the goal is to ensure 90 liters per person per day, below the 110 liters recommended by the United Nations.

Reforesting and conserving recharge areas and combating the degradation of soil due to change in use are the recommendations of Fabiola Tábora, executive secretary of the Global Water Partnership (GWP) in Central America.

Droughts in Central America have a worse impact along the Pacific west coast, which concentrates 70 percent of the sub-region’s population and is known as “the dry corridor”. That hurts food security and hydropower generation, which accounts for half of the national energy supply, she told IPS.

Another positive experience was the recovery of the La Poza micro-basin, in the southwest of El Salvador, involving broad community participation in integrated management, Tábora mentioned.

In Costa Rica and Guatemala, she highlighted the work with private companies and the government to generate environmental funds, which are invested in the management and conservation of watersheds.

These were cited as solutions in response to numerous references to world tragedies during the initial sessions of the 8th World Water Forum: nearly 700 million people without access to water in the world, two billion people drinking contaminated water, 3.5 billion without sanitation, a thousand children dying a day because of poor water quality and projections that the situation will worsen in the future.

The government leaders that were present followed the World Water Forum theme “Sharing Water”,by making continuous calls for cooperation and exchange of knowledge and experiences, since 40 percent of the world’s population depends on transboundary waters.","We Must Take Care of Nature, Because Without Rain There Is No Fresh WaterThis article is part of a series of stories and op-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of World Water Day on Mar.

Jelimo was not troubled by the lack of customers but by the loss of her home, which her husband forced her and their two children to leave when they separated five years ago. He now lives in the house with another woman.

“We were married for 13 years and I didn’t expect him to do such a thing,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Kenya has one of Africa’s most progressive constitutions, guaranteeing equal rights to own property, but culture often takes precedence, leaving thousands of women at risk of homelessness and poverty.

Less than five percent of title deeds are held jointly by men and women or by women alone, according to the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (FIDA), an advocacy group.

Jelimo bought the half-acre plot in Kapsabet with a 300,000 shilling ($2,956) loan, but she allowed her husband to register it in his name as he was the one who negotiated with the seller, she said.

Local officials - some of whom were women - could not persuade Jelimo’s husband to allow her to return to the house.

“They told me: ‘This is a family affair. Go and settle those issues at home’,” 36-year-old Jelimo said.

One district officer told Jelimo that her husband was “so handsome any woman would admire to have him”, she said.

Jelimo has not gone to court because she hears that it is expensive and she is too poor to hire a lawyer.

EQUITABLE ACCESS

In the lush green hills of the Great Rift Valley, women in headscarves with toddlers tied to their backs toil in the midday sun to grow food for their families and local markets.

The World Bank estimates that women run more than three-quarters of Kenya’s farms. But men are the traditional decision-makers and landowners among Nandi farmers and herders. Women are regarded as inferiors, like children, Jelimo said.

Attitudes are changing slowly. Women won about eight local leadership positions in Nandi County in 2017, compared to one seat in the 2013 elections.

But this has done little to help women bridge the gulf between cultural traditions and recent equality laws.

Kenya’s 2010 constitution promises equitable access to land and to eliminate gender discrimination in law, customs and practices related to property.

There has been little action on the ground, said Karin Fueg deputy director for UN Women in Kenya.

“We need to raise the awareness,” she said. “Access to information is an issue and also the old question of mindsets and cultural stereotypes.”

A Land Registration Act, introduced in 2012, provides for joint ownership and gives wives a legal right to land held in their husbands’ names, according to FIDA.

In addition, the 2013 Matrimonial Property Act gives divorced women joint rights over property they lived on and owned with their husbands and prevents any land transfer without their consent.

But many women are unaware of these rights. Most believe they can only own land by buying it themselves. Men often evict women from shared property, taking advantage of their ignorance and the inaccessibility of the courts, experts say.

“Despite the fact that the constitution stipulates that women can own land, our people have not yet accepted that,” said 27-year-old Nancy Chemutai, one of six women elected to Nandi’s county assembly.

“They feel that women are still weak and cannot get title deeds to own land ... (If) you are a hardworking lady, you can go buy land somewhere else but not here.”

‘IT WAS MINE’

Magdalene Chepkosgey, a teacher, is also struggling to keep a roof over her head after her marriage broke down.

When she married, her father-in-law gave the young couple a piece of his land, which was not titled.

“I lived and tilled there, knowing it was mine,” she said.

About two-thirds of Kenya is owned by communities without formal title deeds, usually passed down from father to son. This makes it hard for women to secure rights except through their husbands - often the only parties recognized in community deals.

When Chepkosgey’s husband walked out in 2012, he left her and the children in the family home. He later took out a title deed in his father’s name and remarried.

In the countdown to Kenya’s August elections, he tried to sell the land to raise funds to run for a political position.

Local leaders intervened to stop Chepkosgey being evicted from the house. But she does not know how to secure her home.

“If I go for a divorce, my fear is I will lose the land,” she said.

“I don’t know how I can get this title deed under my name.”","Less than five percent of title deeds are held jointly by men and women or by women alone, according to the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (FIDA), an advocacy group.

The absence of laws offering protection from domestic violence, and from sexual harassment in the workplace, has left women around the world at a disadvantage, according to a report published on Thursday.



As the #MeToo movement gathers pace across poorer countries, governments could step up legal reforms already being made in some regions, said experts.The study, which looked at 189 economies, found that women continue to face widespread barriers that keep them out of jobs and prevent them from owning a business by restricting their access to credit or control over marital property.



“Unfortunately, laws are a straight line for men and a maze for many women around the world, and that needs to change,” said Sarah Iqbal, programme manager of the World Bank’s women, business and law project.

“There is no reason to keep women out of certain jobs or prevent them from owning a business. Our message is simple: no women, no growth.”

Equatorial Guinea is among a number of countries where laws are so regressive that a woman still needs her husband’s signature, or the blessing of a male relative, to secure a work contract, take out a loan, or buy a house.

In 104 economies, women are barred from working at night or in jobs including manufacturing, construction, energy or agriculture, negatively affecting the choices of more than 2.7 billion women, according to the women, business and law report, published every two years.

Giving women equal opportunity is a moral and economic imperative and rescinding discriminatory laws is a vital first step Shanta Devarajan, World Bank

“No economy can grow to its full potential unless women and men participate fully,” said World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva.



“Yet in more than half the world women are still prevented from working in certain jobs simply because of their gender. The report finds where there is gender equality in labour laws, more women work and earn more relative to men.”

Women are more likely to own their own businesses in countries where there is legal protection against harassment and abuse, yet 45 of the 189 economies examined – including Afghanistan, Myanmar and Russia – do not have laws on domestic violence, while 59 countries have no laws on sexual harassment in the workplace.

“The study calculates data up to 1 June 2017 but, as the #MeToo movement builds momentum in the developing world, we could see more progress and sexual harassment protections increase,” said Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank’s senior director for development economics.

“Giving women equal opportunity is a moral and economic imperative and rescinding discriminatory laws is an important first step,” he added.

Each economy evaluated for the fifth edition of the World Bank report was assigned a score from zero to 100 across seven categories. These included accessing institutions, using property, getting a job, building credit and protecting women from violence.

While no economy was given a perfect score, Britain, New Zealand and Spain were among the top performers.

Overall, 21 economies – many located in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa – received a score of zero on protecting women from violence.

The study also found that only 76 countries mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value, while 37 economies have no laws protecting pregnant women from dismissal.

The report also charted some improvements since the previous data release. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia were among 65 countries that have made 87 legal reforms over the past two years.“The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country where there has been a lot of sexual violence, yet it has passed some sweeping legislation that makes women and men equal in nearly all aspects of entrepreneurialism,” said Devarajan.

In Kenya, meanwhile, laws have been introduced to protect women from domestic violence as well as sexual, psychological, and economic abuse from partners and former partners.

“There is no question these laws have a significant impact on women’s economic opportunity. The next critical step to improving the lives of women is implementing them,” said Devarajan.

The report cited dozens of other studies that illustrate how the implementation of such laws can have a significant impact on women’s earning power and agency.

It also highlighted research that shows gender gaps cause an average income loss of 15% in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, 40% of which is due to entrepreneurship gaps. Losses are estimated to be significantly higher in developing countries.","Legal barriers that prevent women from working or limit their opportunities to own a business are having a negative impact on global growth and economic equality, a World Bank study has found.
“Unfortunately, laws are a straight line for men and a maze for many women around the world, and that needs to change,” said Sarah Iqbal, programme manager of the World Bank’s women, business and law project.
“Yet in more than half the world women are still prevented from working in certain jobs simply because of their gender.
“Giving women equal opportunity is a moral and economic imperative and rescinding discriminatory laws is an important first step,” he added.
The study also found that only 76 countries mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value, while 37 economies have no laws protecting pregnant women from dismissal."
39,https://theconversation.com/syrians-yes-iraqis-no-the-startling-disparity-in-britains-asylum-decisions-92881,"Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Conversation UK,"Syrians yes, Iraqis no: the startling disparity in Britain’s asylum decisions","Collateral, a new TV mini-series on the BBC written by David Hare, revolves around the murder of a young man working as a pizza delivery driver in London. One of the main themes running through the drama series is the situation of asylum seekers in the UK.

We soon learn that the murder is linked to events that occurred while the victim and his two sisters were crossing by boat from Turkey to Greece. Initially pretending to be from Syria, the women are eventually revealed as Iraqi. In the words of an aggressive MI5 officer, that means they “have no right to asylum.”

This assertion is incorrect: Iraqis can claim asylum in the UK.

The latest government statistics show that, in 2017, 368 Iraqi nationals were granted asylum at the initial decision stage. However, this figure constitutes only 20% of the 1,844 Iraqi applicants in that year: higher than the rate for Pakistanis (14%), but far distant from the figures for Iranians (47%) and Sudanese (62%). These figures are approximations as not all applications will be lodged and receive an initial decision within the same calendar year.

Most striking is the comparison with Syrian asylum seekers – 83% of the 832 applicants were given some form of status in 2017. This is in addition to the 4,832 Syrians granted humanitarian protection that year through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. The difference in positive initial decisions between Iraqi and Syrian applications was similar in 2016: 12% for the former and 86% for the latter. Small wonder, then, that the Iraqi family in the BBC drama Collateral try to pass themselves off as Syrian.

From a humanitarian perspective, the disparity in treatment of Syrians and Iraqis is difficult to fathom. Both countries have been torn apart by years of extreme political violence. Both have experienced immense displacement of civilians within their territory and over their borders. In recent years, much of the displacement has been at the hands of the same forces operating in both Syria and Iraq, notably the Islamic State.

It is the scale of external displacement that most obviously distinguishes the two. According to recent figures, in excess of 5.5m Syrians are registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the countries surrounding Syria, compared to 263,000 people displaced from Iraq. This difference in numbers justifies disparity in the volume of response to Syrians and Iraqis – but it fails to explain the starkly different rates of asylum granted by the British government.

Some might argue that the different treatment of asylum seekers from the two countries reflects socio-economic differences between their populations. Among humanitarians working in the Middle East there is a common perception that Iraqis are more “urban” and “middle-class” than Syrians. Correct or not this perception fuels a belief that Iraqis are better able to cope with life in exile – even in a country such as Jordan where the majority are not allowed to work.

There are certainly many wealthy Iraqis who have been able to acquire residency in Jordan and enjoy comfortable lives. Yet, in low cost neighbourhoods, thousands of Iraqis can be found living side-by-side with Syrians, Sudanese, Eritrean and other displaced people. Their educational attainments and their savings have proven insufficient to prevent a steady descent into poverty. Access to basic services is at least as constrained for impoverished Iraqis as it is for their neighbours.

A question of responsibility

Some western nations, including the US, Australia, Canada, and Germany recognised the scale of suffering of displaced Iraqis in neighbouring countries and, for many years, ran modest resettlement programmes. A few continue to do so.

The UK, meanwhile, has never had a sustained programme of resettlement for Iraqis. The contrast with the US is particularly striking given the fact that the governments of the US and UK together led the invasion of Iraq in 2003: ignoring the warnings about the destabilisation of the country and the mass displacement that would likely ensue.

There are indications that the Americans recognise their responsibility for the Iraqi refugee crisis. However, the actions of successive UK governments suggest an unwillingness to make a similar acknowledgement of culpability.

In 2016, after much deliberation and delay the British Government published the “Iraq Enquiry”: a report on the UK’s role in the war. It concluded that the decision of then-prime minister, Tony Blair, and parliament to invade Iraq was of questionable legality, based upon inadequate intelligence, and that it undermined the UN Security Council. To date no action has been taken against Blair and his team.

Meanwhile, 15 years after the invasion of their country, millions of ordinary Iraqis still contend with the consequences of this misadventure. Despite the best efforts of the authorities to prevent their arrival on UK soil, some continue to reach these shores. Here they discover that their suffering is less likely to receive a sympathetic response within the asylum system than that of Syrians, Iranians, Sudanese and others. The government has chosen to move on. And so, it seems, must they.","In the words of an aggressive MI5 officer, that means they “have no right to asylum.”This assertion is incorrect: Iraqis can claim asylum in the UK.

The National People’s Congress also appointed close Xi ally Wang Qishan to the formerly ceremonial post of vice-president.

At the Great Hall of the People, Xi, Wang and other officials took turns stepping to the lectern to place their left hands on the constitution and raise their right fists as they delivered an oath swearing loyalty to the constitution, the motherland and the people.

Xi’s reappointment was approved by all 2,970 members of the NPC in attendance, while there was only one vote against Wang’s appointment.

Xi, who leads the ruling Communist party, was also reappointed as head of the government commission that commands the military. He is already head of an identical party body overseeing the armed forces.

The 64-year-old is considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Last weekend, Xi was given the right to continue in office indefinitely after the NPC scrapped term limits for the president and vice-president.

Chinese officials defended the move, saying it would bring the presidency in line with Xi’s positions as head of the party and commander of the armed forces.

But critics say it is likely to lead to increased political repression and possible infighting among party factions seeking to promote their own candidates within the closed system.

Xi became president in 2013 and has not said how many additional five-year terms he intends to serve. State media said the removal of term limits would not alter conditions for retirement or create a president in perpetuity.

As China’s vice-president, Wang, 69, is expected to be a key element in furthering Xi’s agenda of shoring up Communist party rule while ending corruption and poverty.

This article is part of a series of stories and op-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of this year’s International Women’s Day on March 8.

KIKWIT, DR Congo, Mar 4 2018 (IPS) - The numbers are hard to fathom. Nearly two million people driven from their homes in 2017 alone. The worst cholera epidemic of the past 15 years, with over 55,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. Countless others killed, maimed or sexually assaulted.

The human costs of the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo are borne disproportionately by women and children, whose homes have been pillaged and burned, who are not in school and thus vulnerable to soldier recruitment, and who have now been left with almost nothing.

“These are not the same conflicts we have been seeing for the last twenty years."" --Jan Egeland



Charlotte Ukuba, 60, fled to Site Etat at Kikwit, Kwilu Province in the southwest of DR Congo.

‘’I’m living now outside with my eight children,” Ukuba told IPS. “My husband was killed last year by the Kamwina Nsapu’s violence in Kasai province. When I came here, I was living first in a church with other displaced persons. But last week, a pastor chased us away. I have no money and need clothes for my children.”

Her eldest daughter is suffering from malaria. ‘’There are no drugs for this girl. I’m calling for help,” she added.

Violence broke out in Kasai in August 2016 following the uprising of local militia in Kasai Central. The crisis has been characterized by repeated clashes between militias and local security forces, which have subsequently generated inter-community conflicts.

Another displaced woman named Rose Thimbangula died at the age of 47 on Feb. 14 in Nzinda commune in Kikwit. The cause of death was tuberculosis complicated by fistula due to sexual violence. She had no money for medicine.

Dressed in a long black dress, Marie Ntumbala, 37, sleeps on the floor of a small room in Mweka, Kasai province. She is originally from a village called Tutando, 150 kilometers from Tshikapa, but was forced out by conflict. Ntumbala was fortunate enough to be taken in by a local family. But she says she is still living on the edge.

“When I’m ill, I can’t go to the hospital because I’m penniless. The Congolese government must help all the displaced persons in our country,” she said.

DR Congo has some 4.5 million internally displaced people, the largest number in Africa. Elections scheduled for 2017 were postponed to the end of this year, as political instability and clashes between soldiers and militias continues to escalate. An estimated 120 armed groups are operating in eastern DR Congo alone.

Humanitarian actors launched the largest ever funding appeal for the country this year, asking for 1.68 billion dollars to assist 10.5 million people. Only half of the 812.5 million dollars appealed for in 2017 was funded.

Brigitte Kishimana is 28 years old and six months pregnant. She lives at the Moni Site in Kalemi, Tanganyika province in the southeast. ‘’I need prenatal care,” she said. “Several other pregnant women at the sites need it too. If not, their lives will be in danger. Last year, four displaced women died during pregnancy or childbirth,” she told IPS.

Georgette Bahire, a 45-year-old farmer in Sud-Kivu province, fled Lulumba village on June 29, 2017. Fighting between government soldiers and the Mai-Mai, an armed group, drove her from her land. She was taken in by a family in the city of Kibanga.

“Humanitarian workers helped us in 2017 with food and some drugs. But the needs are still great,” she said.

Since the beginning of this year, armed conflicts have continued to plague the country, particularly in the areas of Rutshuru, Masisi, Walikale, South-Lubero and Beni. The gradual withdrawal of humanitarian aid workers from these areas has amplified the vulnerability of people affected by the humanitarian crisis, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a September 2017 report.

“The crisis in DR Congo has deteriorated exponentially over the last two years,” Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told IPS in an interview. “These are not the same conflicts we have been seeing for the last twenty years. Regions that were normally peaceful and stable areas of the country such as the Grand Kasai region and Tanganyika have now become hotbeds of unrest, with intercommunal violence displacing hundreds of thousands.”

“The fighting in the Kivus and Ituri is pushing the conflict in DR Congo closer and closer to a regional humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes into neighbouring countries like Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. A fresh appeal is necessary because while humanitarian needs are exploding and assistance is not able to meet the pace of needs.”

Egeland called on the international community to prioritize the humanitarian crisis in DR Congo and step up their efforts to help the 13.1 million people in need of assistance.

“If not,” he warned, “there will be fatal consequences for the country and possibly for the region.”

IOM is working to provide durable solutions for 5,973 IDP households in the North-Kivu province.

‘’Currently, IOM is helping 77 displaced women suffering from fistulas caused by sexual violence,” IOM Programme Officer Jean-Claude Bashirahishize told IPS. “In 2017, IOM received 205 cases of sexual violence in 12 sites,” he said, adding that cultural taboos made it difficult for women to talk about what had happened to them.

IOM helps victims of sexual violence get economic assistance, but also to train in livelihood activities so they can become self-sufficient.

‘’Insecurity is the greatest barrier to IOM accessing areas where armed groups are fighting government military forces,” Bashirahishize added.

Patrice Mushidinima, a civil society leader at Bukavu, the county seat of Sud-Kivu province, confirmed this, telling IPS, “Sud-Kivu province has 33 distinct armed groups operating in the area.”

In October 2017, the Congolese government and FAO helped more than 20,000 internally displaced persons, of whom about whom 70 percent were women and children at Kikwit, Kwilu province. But the situation is growing increasingly dire.

‘’Farmers who fled due to conflict have missed three consecutive planting seasons. This has left people with almost nothing to eat. Food assistance is failing to fill the gap. Only 400,000 out of the 3.2 million severely food insecure people in Kasai received assistance in December. More than 750,000 are still displaced,” FAO, UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) warned in a statement.

‘’IDPs have rights that need to be respected by the government and other authorities in the country. The Congolese Constitution claims that human life is sacred,” Valentin Mbalanda, a human rights activist in DR Congo, told IPS.

The European Commission, United Nations, and Dutch government will co-host a pledging conference in April. Jan Egeland said that international donors must give the same attention and priority to DR Congo that they do comparable crises around the globe.

“That means they must put their muscle and weight behind a successful donor conference and fulfill any pledges made. Donors must also look at needs on the ground and not just the bottom line. The DR Congo crisis of 2018 is not what is was in 2000 or 2005,” he said.

“Lastly, the international community must acknowledge the consequence of doing nothing. The stakes in DR Congo are high if inaction is the route we choose. There could be mass loss of life and humanitarian neglect could destabilize the entire region. This is a crisis of conscience that the world cannot afford to ignore.”","Dressed in a long black dress, Marie Ntumbala, 37, sleeps on the floor of a small room in Mweka, Kasai province.

42,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2018/03/yemen-war-houthis-economy-central-bank-salaries-government.html,"Wed, 07 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Al-Monitor,No light at end of tunnel for Yemen’s economy,"SANAA, Yemen — Hassan walks about one mile each day to get to his new job as a private security guard, to save on transportation costs. He barely makes $100 each month. The 42-year-old used to be a departmental director in the Ministry of Electricity and Energy, but the war has led to massive power outages in the country and he lost his job after much of the ministry’s work was halted.

""I try to provide my family with the minimum food needs with my job,"" he told Al-Monitor. ""Our situation has changed since the war broke out; our salaries have been suspended for more than a year, and I am spending all my savings and selling what I can. Five months ago I left my apartment in downtown Sanaa because of accumulated rent due. I now live with my wife and child in a room at my parents’ old house.""

More than 1.2 million government employees have found themselves in a similar situation since their salaries were suspended 14 months ago.

The financial impact varies per person due to the economic conflict between the internationally recognized government in Aden and the Houthi government in Sanaa. The Central Bank of Yemen was moved to Aden on Sept. 18, 2016, and the government there stopped paying the salaries of employees in Houthi-controlled areas. The government wants the revenues of state institutions in those areas — such as customs taxes and the revenues of al-Hodeidah port under the Houthi control — to be transferred to the central bank. But the Houthis are still refusing this demand.

Meanwhile, the economy in Yemen continues to go downhill. The Yemeni riyal is collapsing against the dollar and has reached its lowest level, recording 475 Yemeni riyals against the US dollar compared with 215 Yemeni riyals before the war broke out in March 2015.

According to a report by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, gross domestic product dropped by 41.8% since the beginning of the conflict.

Mustafa Nasser, the head of the Economic Media Center, an independent center specialized in economic studies and set up jointly with the World Bank and international organizations, told Al-Monitor, “The unpaid salaries are a key reason behind the economic collapse in Yemen. If the crisis continues, millions of people will starve and economic activity will be paralyzed. Employees are the main economic and financial element in Yemen.”

The United Nations has repeatedly said that the salary halt exacerbated the economic crisis and eradicated food security, but no breakthrough has been recorded to solve the problem. In January, UN Undersecretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Mark Lowcock expressed in a press statement deep concern about the deteriorating humanitarian and economic situations in Yemen.

Lowcock said that 22.2 million people need humanitarian relief in Yemen, and that this figure is unprecedented and has jumped by 3.4 million since 2017.

The UN estimates the civilian death toll at more than 5,200 since the start of the war in March 2015.

On Oct. 18, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa Khairat Kabalari said in a statement that after 2½ years of conflict the education of 4.5 million Yemeni children is on the line. Three-quarters of teachers have not been paid since October 2016.

Ahmad Shamakh, an economic expert at the Yemeni Shura Council, told Al-Monitor, “The crisis of suspended salaries has worsened the economic situation and the central bank is obviously slackening in its work. If it weren’t for the transfers by the Yemeni diaspora to the country, the dollar rate would have exceeded 750 Yemeni riyals.”

The UN International Fund for Agricultural Development issued a report Feb. 26 indicating that money transfers in Yemen reached $3.4 billion in 2016, a slight increase from $3.35 billion in 2015, continuing a trend of increased transfers amid the war.

Sociologist at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research Khaled Qassem said that the salary suspension has worsened poverty and has deprived millions of children of education and social security. He told Al-Monitor, “The repercussions are multiplying. The situation is not only affecting the nuclear family but also the extended one. The disputing parties are taking advantage of people’s financial needs to recruit militants, especially children.”

Nasser said that solving the issue of salaries is linked to a political solution. He noted, “Pressing solutions might be adopted through an initiative led by the Central Bank of Yemen, in cooperation with the UN and all concerned Yemeni parties to ensure paying the salaries of all employees.”

He added, “All amounts collected by the Houthis — including customs and taxes — must be handed over to the central bank branches in all Yemeni areas, and a settlement between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government must be reached in case of shortage.”

Shamakh said, ""Urgent economic decisions should be taken to solve the imbalance, improve the state’s financial resources, increase production in promising sectors, activate the role of the central bank and its tools, control the black market and shut down the black markets in Houthi areas. This would improve the state’s financial resources and bridge the gap between income and expenditure and lead to paying salaries.""

Facing such tough humanitarian conditions and war repercussions, the disputing parties keep blaming each other and voicing conflicting stances. Meanwhile, UN institutions continue to send out warnings and international stances without taking actual action to put an end to this humanitarian catastrophe weighing down millions of helpless Yemeni citizens.","""I try to provide my family with the minimum food needs with my job,"" he told Al-Monitor.

My memories are of magnificent architecture and heritage sites, bustling market places and busy restaurants. The oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, credited with the invention of writing and agriculture, Damascus was astonishing, and its people prosperous and welcoming.

But war changes everything.

Seven years, to the day, since the Syrian civil war began, the city is barely recognisable. Relentless air-raids, chemical weapon attacks, and territorial battles between Islamist and pro-Assad paramilitary groups – as well as intervention by international actors - have displaced half the population and left eight million children living under the constant threat of bombs and bullets.

Our staff on the ground in Syria are reporting a humanitarian crisis for children, with insufficient food and water, and widespread child malnutrition. The war has destroyed health, education, energy and sanitation infrastructure, and the UN is struggling to deliver aid.

We are running child-friendly spaces in an attempt to ameliorate some of these effects by providing children with rest, food, medical attention, trauma counselling, and most importantly of all, a chance to play. But it will be years before the full extent of the psychological impact on children is known.

Work being done to protect children stretches well beyond Syria’s borders – as does the impact of the conflict itself – to refugee camps in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and all along the world’s key migrant routes. Lebanon alone is hosting more than half a million Syrian children, while in Greece we are caring for hundreds of unaccompanied child refugees.

But this is not an isolated situation. This complex conflict, with its widespread political and social ramifications is being replicated in hotspots all over the world. Nigeria, Libya, South Sudan, Yemen and the Central African Republic are all experiencing violent conflicts that have precipitated a global child refugee crisis.

Right now, one in six children worldwide – that’s at least 357 million– are growing up in a war-zone.

No child should be raised in bloodshed and bombing. Yet those who escape conflict often find they have exchanged one horror for another. The world’s 50 million child refugees experience poverty, uncertainty, and discrimination. Worse still, 300,000 are facing this alone, increasing exponentially their vulnerability to trafficking, slavery, exploitation and abuse.

We are caring for thousands of unsupported child refugees, and that work includes trying to reunite them with family. But for children with leave to remain in the UK - who have fled conflict and persecution, and survived the dangers of the route to Europe - this process is hampered by rules which prohibit children from applying for their families to join them. Regulations the Home Affairs Select Committee themselves describe as ‘perverse’.

Where is the sense in forcing children to live in care, when they could be raised by people who love them? Where is the humanity in denying a child – who has already been traumatised by war and bereavement - the chance of a normal, healthy family life?

On Friday, the Refugee Family Reunion Bill has its second reading before the UK Parliament. If it passes, it will be an important step towards reuniting child refugees with their families. We are fighting to ensure that it does.

At SOS Children’s Villages we know there is no better environment to raise a child than a caring and supportive family. In all its variety and forms, family shapes a young person’s development through millions of daily interactions, encouragements and reassurances. Making any child sacrifice this in return for sanctuary from war is inexcusable.

Pandit Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, one of the best-known sarod players of his generation belonging to Senia Maihar Gharana, won the prestigious ITC SRA Award (2017) recently. Almost all the Kolkata-soirees this winter saw him cast his spell with the mellow, emotion-charged melody of his sarod, steeped in the essence of the raga and spiced up with thrillingly intelligent mathematical permutations of rhythm-play. Undoubtedly, he possesses an uncanny ability to take the listeners from all walks of life along with him; both on and off the stage.

He is also a very successful composer with several films in his kitty; very well informed musician with a large following (some of whom call him ‘the BBC of music world’); successful organiser (of the annual super-star-studded Swar Samrat Music Festival) and a dedicated Guru; albeit most of the time he is seen on the concert platforms, in novel fusion circuits and in recording studios all over the globe.

An extremely good conversationalist, he spoke about his eventful musical journey. Excerpts:

On Maihar Gharana

Many say that Maihar cannot claim a gharana status; because Baba Alauddin Khan learnt from Wazir Khan, direct descendent of Miyan Tansen, who hailed from Rampur, not Maihar. But frankly, Baba came from Bangladesh, stayed in Calcutta and learnt several instruments from several maestros. He assimilated all and groomed generations of disciples from all over India in Maihar, his abode as Maharaja of Maihar’s court musician. His sons Ali Akbar, Bahadur along with Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, all were trained there. That is why this successful school is known as Senia Maihar Gharana.

On his style

My style is both dhrupad centric and khayal centric. It is difficult to segregate. Earlier khayal compositions were played as gat-bandish replete with khayal vocalism. Baba was a percussionist par excellence; his compositions changed the complexion by infusing instrumentalism and rhythm in tantrakari-based gats. There are compositions that begin from 12th beat, some drut bandish patterns cover more than one tala-cycle, some are domuha or sam-visham and some are chaumuha. My tabla-grooming helps me to see the micro beats with bird’s eye view and enjoy the rhythm-play. In fact, ever since I was told that my music leans heavily on emotions, I consciously include these brain-teasers.

On ragas

Ali Akbar Khansaheb would often say, ‘This vilambit vistar in alaap is out of rhythm,’ because rhythm is everywhere. While in conversation, you and I speak in different speed.

A raga too has its own laya of opening up. Hansdhwani will lose its character if played at Yaman’s pace. The 32” chest cannot be displayed as 56”. While handling a raga blended out of two/three ragas such as Kausi Kanada, Puria Kalyan, Shuddh Kalyan, we need to take permission from all ragas concerned, gradually seek entry in their integrated domain; and then get intimate with their persona’s hidden features. Among the sthayi, antara, sanchari and abhog, the last is the most demanding.

There are two ways of ripening a fruitful relationship: natural or through carbide like method. Natural process takes its time while pre-composed music produces photo finish.

Both work differently with different types of audiences/connoisseurs. Understanding a raga is no less than understanding a person. One can tell by touching the nail of an intimately known person. Similarly, a single note gives away the identity of a raga. Once this done, the raga leads the way!

On lighter genres

My vocalist wife Manasi’s Guruma Appaji (Girija Devi) had taught me that no music can be termed as ‘light’. Moreover, my father, a good composer, made me play in his recordings. That early exposure made my sarod mic-friendly and also tickled my imagination. I became aware of different instruments’ diverse plus and minus points. Later I joined AIR as casual staff in 1984. One of their productions, arranged by me, was heard by Ajoy (Chakrabarty) da. He asked me to arrange his recordings then onwards. That opened the floodgates. Then in 2001, the Sufiana ‘Naina Piya Se’ happened in Rashid Khan’s voice. Several films fell on my lap. All enriched my relationship with raga music.

On teaching

The hand-placement is of utmost importance, because in sarod 25 strings jostle within a very small space. Feather-light movement of the wrist-joint and equally light hold on jawa (plectrum), to ensure a gentle stroke only on one string, demands well-mastered precision. In this regard Ustad Amjad Ali Khan’s playing technique of da and diri are matchless. Diridiri entails modulating the volume of sound from soft to loud while playing taan-like fine-grained phrases.

Like sitar, sarod has its own language with ‘ra’ offering different effects from various spots of the instrument. Note-sustenance is its strong point.

The space between Ma and Pa can be both swift and deliberately stretched. Ali Akbar Khan saheb’s technique in this aspect is inimitable. He could reduce the volume of a longish meend and then again increase the volume. One can bring vocalism through such technical brilliance and feel.

I had been teaching for years but got associated with Bengal Foundation of Bangladesh two years back. Unlike Indians, the young talents are not quality conscious there; because there are several TV channels chasing them. Now, they are beginning to understand the importance of good grooming.

For beginners my first step is tuneful palta playing; next, palta-based different ragas, then rhythm-bound palta to understand the micro beats; and finally, composition that encapsulates the raga structure. The questions that I asked as a student, I discuss those at length in my class. Theory apart, flexibility and retention are god’s gifts. For some, music and rhythm comes easily while others slog for hours to get to that point. Technical prowess is a very important tool especially for instrumentalists. With that one can translate one’s thought process into action. Mental practice can continue ceaselessly in a musical environment.

This had helped me and this is helping my budding sarod-player son Indrayudh as well. We know that sarod has immense possibilities in the arena of sound production. There is plenty to do!

That indomitable spirit...

The sarod maestro on his benevolent gurus and his intense training

I hail from a passion driven musicians’ family but without the chip on my shoulders. In fact, my sitarist father Ranjan Majumdar did not want me to become a professional musician; because he had to struggle a lot to make ends meet as the eldest son of the family that got uprooted during Partition. Despite his excellent grooming under Ustad Dabir Khan (of Tansen’s lineage) and Maharaja Birendra Kishore Roychowdhury, my father had to find a quick solution to financial problems. As a member of the ballet unit of the legendary Uday Shankar he toured extensively, and, when in town, accompanied dancers, arranged music for recordings.

My doting grandfather Bibhuti Ranjan Majumdar, an amateur violinist, introduced me to studies and play and all genres of music, even Western music! My uncle learnt sarod under Ustad Bahadur Khan. Seeing my interest in music, they allowed me to play mandolin, but sent me to Pandit Amaresh Chowdhury for vocal training and Balaram De and Anil Palit introduced me to the world of rhythm and its varied tempi (tala and laya).

All these factors scripted my life’s story. I was exposed to all facets of music making – in the studios and on the concert stage as accompanists; even before I went to Bahadur Kaka. An extremely busy musician, he took six months to decide whether or not to accept me as his disciple. Since then sarod became my inseparable identity and very soon we became very close. Despite my preoccupation with Physics as major subject in BSc, rewards like the first position in All India Radio competition and President’s Gold Medal etc. encouraged my folks to allow me to remain focused on this path. The untimely death of my Ustad led me to Pandit Ajay Sinha Roy and finally to Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.

On taleem

Bahadur Kaka would give one composition with several palta (sequenced phrases), taan and vistar phrases. There was no recorder in those days. What I couldn’t memorise was lost for the time being; but what I retained then, remains with me till date and the so-called ‘lost’ phrases arrive with them, like shadows. He gave me taaleem for eighteen years during which he taught one raga several times for six to nine months, with sister ragas’s similarities and differences. He gave me rare things culled out of Baba Alauddin Khan’s diary. During the last lesson of Yaman, a raga that he taught me six times, he gave a special palta and said, ‘With this in your armor, you cannot go wrong in Yaman.’

Such sessions would continue for six hours at times. Apart from raagdaari, focus on playing technique was another important arena. He taught me even those techniques what he didn’t play himself! Those lessons gave my playing a different character that is closer to his legendary brother’s. He would also take me to senior musicians to teach tameez, tehzeeb and make me learn compositions from several gharanas. This intense and integrated grooming helped me immensely when I went to Ali Akbar Khansaheb who would ask me to tread on seemingly impossible tracks of playing technique with a scientist’s conviction ‘Eta hobey’ (this is possible)! That indomitable spirit guides me relentlessly.

On being a foodie

I am an unabashed foodie; my gurus knew it and pampered me; especially Ali Akbar Khan saheb who was a good cook as well and who never missed a chance to tease me! In 1997, we were in Mumbai for some work. We went to pay a visit to Pishima (Annapurna Devi). From there Khan saheb wanted to go to a vegetarian restaurant in Churchgate where he had eaten sometime in 1956-57. He did locate the place without much problem; such was his memory; but unfortunately the place was under renovation. So we went to another place of my choice which is known for its non-vegetarian spread. Albeit fond of vegetarian food, Khan saheb also relished Indian cuisine like kebabs and biryani. He kept ordering dishes to feed me till I threw my hands up.

On another occasion (tabla maestro) Swapan (Chaudhuri) da was interviewing Khan saheb for Doordarshan and asked him, ‘How do you manage to arrive at sam so easily as one sips water from his palm?’ In reply, he said, ‘When hungry, we eat but once satiated we stop eating and drink water. My arrival at sam is like the latter (sam hocche jal khaowar moton). Of course, if I eat like Tejen, this seemingly easy thing will be difficult!’ This is how he explained Time and Space!","His sons Ali Akbar, Bahadur along with Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, all were trained there.
Understanding a raga is no less than understanding a person.
All enriched my relationship with raga music.
Ali Akbar Khan saheb’s technique in this aspect is inimitable.
The untimely death of my Ustad led me to Pandit Ajay Sinha Roy and finally to Ustad Ali Akbar Khan."

In the humanitarian sector there is a subset of aid workers – usually white male international staff – who remain blind to the way gender impacts on their work. They consider the issue an annoying detail that NGOs should be allowed to leave at the door when the context is an emergency and bombs are falling. The problem is seen as especially trivial when raised by young women who management and HR assume simply can’t handle the “hardship posting”.



At one dinner party … the lead medic said he knew 'what size speculum to use for each woman at the table'

When you work and socialise on the same compound with the same people, and upper management continues to be male dominated, professional and personal boundaries are inevitably blurred. When you are sick in the field, your doctor is your boss. When you go drinking at the weekend, it is with the same man. This results in subtle and unsubtle power plays in the field, often with much poorer behaviour than is seen in other professions.



Sexual harassment and sexual “ownership” of new expatriate female staff is a significant part of this story. In rural Africa we saw that visiting HQ managers liked to discuss the foolishness of past (female) staff whose dalliances with local men had led to pregnancy, redundancy and humiliation. These “lessons” were apparently aimed at coaxing isolated or lonely female staff into the arms of HQ visitors.

However, the double standards run deep. It was an open secret that male staff often visited brothels or impregnated local women, leaving them without child support in situations of poverty.



Then there was the tale of the senior manager who repeatedly asked female staff to tell him where their bedrooms were and telephoned them in the middle of the night. After constant pressure, some staff have sex with men like this, and those who reject them face the possibility of being undermined in their workplace. At one dinner party, conversation turned to maternal health, and the lead medic announced that he knew “what size speculum to use for each and every woman at the table”. This was apparently laughed off by senior management present.

In my experience, this kind of workplace culture means that many young women working in the humanitarian space find themselves able to move ahead only through compromising on their values. HR responds by listening sympathetically and taking no action, maintaining the status quo and pacifying whistleblowers. In many cases the male staff were retained, promoted and moved countries. We were told that the organisation knew they had sexually harassed women or behaved inappropriately previously but hoped they would “grow out of it”.

Overall there is little understanding on how to change workplace cultures in the aid sector to make them a safe place that values female staff. Although these incidents are nothing new and sexism in the workplace hardly shocking, it is an important next step in the debate on sexual abuse in the sector. If the humanitarian space is to practise what it preaches in terms of gender equality it needs to go further than investigating serious abuse and consider the sexism at the heart of many NGO work cultures.","Sexual harassment and sexual “ownership” of new expatriate female staff is a significant part of this story.

Syria: No ceasefire for 'hell on earth' eastern Goutha

Competing imperialist interests have contributed to turning Syria into the present nightmare for ordinary people, photo by Jordi Bernabeu Farrús/CC (Click to enlarge)

Eastern Goutha, outside Damascus, is ""hell on earth"", according to United Nations (UN) chief Antonio Guterres.

Nearly 400,000 civilians have been under siege in this rebel enclave since 2013. The day after the UN decision to organise a ceasefire, bombing continued.

Over 700 people have been killed and many thousands wounded in recent weeks. A doctor told the BBC his hospital has ""no electricity, no medication, no oxygen, no medication for anaesthesia, no painkillers, no antibiotics"".

A stripped-down aid relief convoy, promised since mid-February, has only now entered the besieged area.

The UN security council's decision on 30 days' immediate ceasefire has had little effect. The Assad regime in Syria and its ally Russia state that the conditions for the ceasefire are not clear and that they are entitled to continue ""attacking terrorists"".

In criticising 'Russian aggression' the western powers are indulging in rank hypocrisy. US forces led several massive military assaults against cities in Iraq over the last decade, including Fallujah and more recently demolishing Mosul in 2017. Today, the major powers back the Saudi regime's air attacks on Yemen, where many civilians have died and chronic hunger and epidemics stalk the land.

The UN resolution speaks of immediate ceasefire except in the case of violations by Isis, al-Qa'ida and al-Nusra.

The dominant armed groups in eastern Goutha are two other militias, Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman. These jihadist groups have regularly launched missiles on inhabited areas of Damascus, causing casualties among the civilian population, although on a far smaller scale than the regime's strikes.

Instead of bringing about peace after Isis was forced to retreat by Assad and his Russian and Iranian allied forces and by US and its proxy militias, the war in Syria has entered a new, if possible even bloodier phase. Those who were supposed to secure peace have stepped up the war.

The conflict revolves around how global and regional powers will secure their positions in a future Syria. Above all, it is a clash over power, influence and prestige between the United States and Russia, with Turkey and Iran as active participants. Israel has also taken action, with fighter aircraft used against Iranian forces in Syria in recent weeks.

At first, Washington supported the same Islamist groups supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But with the emergence of Isis, which established a 'Caliphate' in 2014, the United States was forced to find new allies.

Its most important allies on the field in recent years have been the Syrian Democratic Forces, with the Kurdish PYD's YPG/YPJ troops in the leadership. The subsequent focus on fighting Isis and Russia's military intervention in Syria since the autumn of 2015, rescued Bashar al-Assad's regime.

Influence

Isis is the convenient opposition that the US uses to maintain troop forces in north eastern Syria. In reality, US actions are about limiting both Russian and Iranian influence. The ""stabilisation"" that both the US and Russia say they are striving for will be far from stable.

Syria was already a dictatorship shaken by a series of crises before the 'Arab Spring' uprising of 2011 and subsequent civil war.

Today, the country has collapsed, with over 500,000 killed and more than ten million forcibly displaced. This is a result of the wars of imperialism, capitalist exploitation and Assad's dictatorship.

Against this, in order to prevent further war and the revival of Isis or similar groups, a revolutionary socialist movement is needed to liberate the working class and oppressed people.

Turkey's military attack against the Afrin pocket under the control of the Kurdish YPG militia started over a month ago, ostensibly to 'fight terrorism'. Hundreds of civilians have been killed and wounded according to Kurdish sources.

The Turkish regime's goal is to eliminate any Kurdish rule in Afrin and Rojava in northern Syria, thereby crushing Kurdish aspirations for national self-determination. At the same time Erdogan's regime has ramped-up Turkish nationalism at home to hinder the development of a united workers' movement against its authoritarian rule.

The Turkish regime seems open to either an escalated war or some form of agreement with the Assad regime in Syria having previously unequivocally called for Assad's overthrow.

Despite Erdogan's very tough stance, accusing the US of being involved in the attempted coup against him in July 2016, and condemning Washington for its cooperation with the PYD in Syria, the White House has avoided direct conflict with Turkey. Trump's security advisor, Herbert McMaster, visited Ankara to reassure Erdogan.

Russia, which controls the airspace over Afrin, gave Turkey the green light to attack by air - strengthening the theory that Erdogan is looking for some form of agreement with the Assad regime.

Nouri Mahmoud, spokesperson for the PYD's armed forces, urged the Syrian government to send troops to secure the border with Turkey. But there is no reason for the Kurds in Afrin to trust troops sent by Assad. The regime in Damascus is acting in response to Turkey, but also to regain control of northern Syria from Kurdish rule.

The YPJ/YPG is a force to be reckoned with. But the Kurdish forces also mistakenly relied on support from the US and Russian air bombings, holding back the possibility of building a larger support for their struggle among the people whose livelihoods have been shattered by these airstrikes.

The Kurds' struggle for independence and the class needs of workers and poor in the Middle East will never find any allies in imperialism nor regional pro-capitalist governments. US imperialism has a history of betraying Kurdish people in the region.

Behind the region's deep crises lie the crisis of capitalism and the historic weakness of the workers' movement, whose struggle for democratic socialism is the only way forward.

Donate to the Socialist Party Finance appeal The coronavirus crisis has laid bare the class character of society in numerous ways. It is making clear to many that it is the working class that keeps society running, not the CEOs of major corporations. The results of austerity have been graphically demonstrated as public services strain to cope with the crisis. The government has now ripped up its 'austerity' mantra and turned to policies that not long ago were denounced as socialist. But after the corona crisis, it will try to make the working class pay for it, by trying to claw back what has been given. The Socialist Party's material is more vital than ever, so we can continue to report from workers who are fighting for better health and safety measures, against layoffs, for adequate staffing levels, etc.

When the health crisis subsides, we must be ready for the stormy events ahead and the need to arm workers' movements with a socialist programme - one which puts the health and needs of humanity before the profits of a few.

Despite our differences, we are both committed to a democratic, inclusive India

Rajeev Gowda

Recently, the Congress’s offer to support Sitaram Yechury instead of its own candidate for election to the Rajya Sabha was spurned unwisely by the Marxists. The party offered to sacrifice its seat because Mr. Yechury is a respected parliamentarian who adds firepower to the opposition benches and an articulate voice that counters the falsehoods of the Modi sarkar. The Congress demonstrated how some sacrifices are worth making at the strategic-national level. The larger cause involves the national interest of holding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its governments accountable to the people. Thus, while analysing this question, one must look at both the strategic-national and tactical-regional perspectives.

Commonalities and differences

Strategically, both agree that the forces of Hindutva are opposed to the idea of a plural, inclusive India and our constitutional ideals. We differ on economic approaches to poverty alleviation. The Left is sometimes anachronistic and dogmatic, whereas the Congress adapts to the zeitgeist. Another flashpoint involves the use of violence by Left cadres, of which Congress workers have faced the brunt in Kerala, West Bengal, and Tripura. But we are both committed to a democratic, inclusive India grounded in social justice and equity. Preserving that India requires a strong alliance of democratic forces across the country. Our main ideological opponents are the divisive forces of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP.

However, tactical considerations in States like Kerala, where the Left and the Congress oppose each other strongly, can come in the way of strategic cooperation at the national level. We must explore how to achieve the delicate balance between competing against one another in some States while coming together for the larger cause of combating divisive forces at the national level. Some analysts argue that if the Congress and Left ally in States where they have historically opposed one another, then a vacuum would be created, and this could induce partypersons to defect to any viable anti-Left formation, including the BJP. But this is not the situation in most States. If we draw a line from Kerala to Kashmir, in the States to the left, centre, and immediate right of the line, the Congress has a strong organisation and is mainly in a direct fight against the BJP. There are no tactical problems in allying in these States. The BJP must be fought both on the ground and in the realm of ideas. Thus, an alternative alliance has to articulate a new narrative.

A credible alternative

A model would be the Common Minimum Programme that worked well during the first United Progressive Alliance government and set up a strong social safety net through a rights-based legislation. A combined opposition could offer a vision and plan of action to address pressing concerns such as education, health, jobs and agrarian distress, which will appeal to those left behind by the BJP’s suit-boot ki sarkar. Our track record of delivering people their constitutional rights ensures that we are a credible alternative.

Large numbers of citizens are disgusted by the BJP’s violence, vigilantism, vandalism and brazen distortion of truth, history and Hinduism. Many voted for Narendra Modi because he promised inclusive development, faster growth, anti-corruption measures and job creation. All of these have turned into mere jumlas. The people of India are looking for leaders who they can count on to fulfil the vision of our founding fathers. Such a platform will be ready when the Left, Congress and secular, regional forces come together for the larger cause of liberating India from the communal clutches of the BJP.

An electoral alliance between the two will only serve to ideologically weaken the Left

Prasenjit Bose

The defeat of the Left Front in Tripura has renewed calls for an alliance between the Left and the Congress to take on the BJP juggernaut. However, the election results showed how the BJP acquired power in the State mainly by eating into the Congress’s vote base. The wanton demolition of Lenin’s statue in Belonia, Tripura, demonstrates the ideological roadblock that the Sangh Parivar faces from the Left.

Opposition to neo-liberalism

The Left’s ideological resistance to the RSS-BJP’s communal-fascistic project is — and will be — a vital component of the struggle to defeat the BJP. A programmatic understanding or an electoral alliance between the Congress and the Left will only serve to ideologically weaken the Left, which is committed to an alternative socio-economic programme. Opposition to the neo-liberal policies pursued by both BJP and Congress-led governments is central to the politics of the Left. The neo-liberal regime has led to the emergence of a corrupted corporatocracy, which has increased socio-economic inequalities, joblessness and rural distress, besides distorting the democratic process through the unfettered use of money power. The increased acceptance of the communal politics of the RSS-BJP in the middle class cannot be seen in isolation of these processes.

The primary task of the Left should be to build people’s movements in opposition to the neo-liberal regime by allying with diverse democratic forces and people’s organisations. Without a determined struggle, the Left will get further marginalised and/or co-opted.

This does not imply equating the RSS-BJP with the Congress or any other secular party. If a situation arises where the Left’s support becomes necessary to oust the Modi government from power and form a secular government, the Left should not hesitate in extending that post-poll support. Such support should be based on principles, not on opportunistic electoral considerations. Overall, the Left should not give up on its programmatic independence, which offers the only hope for an alternative, post-neoliberal order.

Equation across States

Those arguing for a Left-Congress alliance on pragmatic considerations fail to appreciate the ground realities. The extant political equation between the Left and the Congress varies across States, where there are many regional players. In the States where the Left still has a consequential base, a Left-Congress alliance would be electorally counterproductive. In Kerala, a Left-Congress alliance can only expand the political space for the BJP; the polarisation between the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front is the best way to keep the BJP out of the fray. In West Bengal, the Left-Congress alliance in the 2016 Assembly elections not only failed to get popular endorsement but led to the Left falling to the third position behind the Congress and enabling the BJP to fast emerge in the State by eating into the Left’s base. Besides, an ‘all in unity against the BJP’ line for the Left will also mean an alliance with the Trinamool Congress, which can only lead to the liquidation of the Left. In Tripura, there is hardly any Congress left to ally with.

Both critics and well-wishers of the Left often argue that the Left has become an ICU patient and therefore needs the Congress as an ally to survive. But an ICU patient needs the help of a doctor, not another ICU patient like the Congress. Ideological rejuvenation and alliances built from below through popular movements can be that doctor that the Left must turn to.

IT’S COMPLICATED

The Left should consider an alliance with the Congress to reinvent itself

Manindra N. Thakur

‘To be, or not to be’ is the current dilemma of the Indian Left. The electoral defeat in Tripura has increased the debate within the Left on the issue of joining hands with the Congress to fight the fascist BJP. Resolution of this dilemma may not alter the history of Indian politics as the Left at present is neither ideologically nor organisationally influential. However, its decision would have historical importance as it would stick with it for years.

At this juncture, the Left has two choices: one, not to bother too much about its electoral prospects and instead make efforts to expand its social base by waging grass-roots struggles against communalism and capitalist exploitation; two, align with the Congress to electorally defeat communal forces.

Two choices

The first choice is a long-term exercise aimed at social transformation and egalitarianism through a people’s struggle. The second is a more pragmatic choice of prioritising the fight against the immediate danger of being eliminated from the political arena. The alliance with the Congress could at least help the Left fight against fascism which is in the garb of majoritarian politics. The religio-cultural nationalism of the BJP, if not confronted electorally, will cause permanent damage to the social fabric necessary for democracy.

However, the dilemma of struggling alone versus aligning with the Congress is not an easy fix. It amounts to prioritising secularism over socialism — a difficult choice for the Indian Left, at least theoretically. In fact, except anti-communalism, the Congress mostly follows an agenda that is antithetical to that of the Left. Moreover, the Left cadres would feel cheated by such alliances as they are generally engaged in ideological as well as electoral battles against the Congress at the grass-roots level. Such alliances would not only confuse them but also alienate them from their leaders.

What the Left should do

The only option for the Left is to think of ways through which it can convert the struggle against communalism into a struggle for socialism. The Tripura vote has shown that the Left cannot by itself survive the communal onslaught of the BJP, which uses high-voltage money power micromanagement techniques to win elections. It will have to reinvent itself by learning from past experiences. It has to initiate a serious dialogue on Marx, Gandhi and Ambedkar, so that its discourse can simultaneously address the issues of dignity and distributive justice. It also has to go beyond the ‘opium thesis’ and learn from the experiment of Latin American Liberation Theology in order to handle the tricky question of religion. Similarly, instead of insisting on state ownership of property, it could favour experiments in commons such as that by the Mondragon Corporation of Spain. This new path would help the Left engage with the Congress in a more meaningful and sustainable way by enlarging the space for transformative politics.

No doubt, with growing unemployment and high cost of living in this crony avatar of capitalism, the future lies in an egalitarian ideology. The Left should consider an alliance with the Congress as a breathing space for reinventing itself so that it can gain ground among the unemployed youth, marginalised farmers, angst-ridden middle class, humiliated minorities, neglected lower castes and disenfranchised small communities. In short, before making alliances, the Left should ensure that these alliances are beneficial for it to expand its base and popularise its ideology.

As countries strive towards a net-zero emission world and with the emergence of excit­ing new and innovative technolo­gies and industries, we need to en­sure that women are not left behind.

These were the remarks of the Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, Mereseini Vuniwaqa, in her last side event at the Commission on the Status of Women CSW 62 in New York, USA.

“Leaving no one behind is after all the pledge of the 2030 sustainable de­velopment agenda,” she said.

In addressing the theme, Ms Vuni­waqa stressed the importance of getting the voice of the rural women heard in international negotiations processes and also touched on the importance of gender inclusion in Nationally Determined Contribu­tions.

“We need to strengthen our efforts to bring the views and issues of our rural women into the climate nego­tiations space. This can only be pos­sible through an inclusive participa­tory process,” she said.

The side event featured representa­tives from governments and grass­roots women’s organizations deliv­ering remarks in a panel discussion format, followed by a discussion and question and answers from the audi­ence.

Jo Scheuer, Director for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduc­tion, Bureau for Policy and Pro­gramme Support, UNDP delivered the opening statement where he emphasised and reiterated that the world’s natural resources have de­pleted as a result of climate change and therefore it is important to understand and know the risks involved and also the fostering of women leadership in development.

The panellists for the events in­cluded Rajashri Sai, Partnership Advisor, Swayam Shikshan Prayog, Emerine Kabanshi, MP, Minister of Community Development and So­cial Services, Zambia, and Mariko Wallen, Coral Restoration Practi­tioner, Fragments of Hope, Belize.

The three panellists all shared ex­periences and thoughts in their own country and organizations context on the event theme “Rural Women Leading Climate Resilience”

Ms Vuniwaqa also spoke about the role of NGO and CSO saying that there was a need for close con­nectivity between the sectoral focal points and the gender groups at all levels-from the negotiators to on-the-ground implementers.

“CSOs and NGOs have a very im­portant role to play as sources and custodians of information, and for facilitating the necessary outreach,” the minister said.

Russia’s serial transgressions, which it contemptuously and without any credibility denies, create an ugly and alarming portrait. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken of an ‘‘economic war’’ in retaliation to the latest blatantly illegal act by Russia on its soil, an assassination attempt that put the lives of hundreds of UK citizens at risk. She has expelled about two dozen Russians – officials and private individuals – and is considering freezing Russian assets in the UK.

We are living in technologically advanced era today when people are aiming to settle in the moon. But there are some harsh realities when it comes to feeding millions of people on the earth. Food security has emerged as a major global challenge today with nearly 800 million people in the world facing hunger.

While the urban population is changing their diet from traditional to “healthier low-fat food”, in some parts, many people are deprived of basic nutrition.

It is estimated that about 1.3 billion ton of food is wasted across the world every year. Every five seconds a child under five dies because of hunger, or of directly related causes.

Those who survive face severe malnutrition, which is a major cause of death. A report has revealed that nearly half of all deaths in children under five are attributable to under-nutrition, which results in the loss of about three million young lives a year.

If we go through the statistics, the number of people suffering from hunger went up by 75 million in 2007 and by 40 million in 2008. In 2016, the number of people affected by hunger reached 815 million or 11 per cent the global population. Similarly, the number of undernourished people in the world went up 1.04 times in 2016 than that was in 2015.

The increased hunger and malnutrition is attributed to poverty, increase in food prices, climate change, natural disasters and conflicts.

Hunger is the world’s no.1 health risk. It kills more people every year than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.

One in seven people in the world go to bed hungry.

Asia and the Pacific region is home to over half the world’s population and nearly two thirds of the world’s hungry people.

Around 65 percent of the world’s hungry live in only seven countries: India, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia.

There is the problem of food insecurity not because the world does not produce enough to feed the population. But it emanates from the fact that food produced in one region is not made available in the other areas. Most of the people in the world are facing hunger because they have a very low purchasing ability.

Conflict is yet another challenge that has emerged as a grave problem, contributing to food insecurity.

The conflict in Asia makes it the continent with the most hungry people – two thirds of the total. However, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest prevalence (percentage of population) of hunger. And climate change is hugely contributing to food insecurity due to increase in temperatures, erratic weather pattern, infestation of disease and pest, invasion of weeds, pest and diseases and by many other ways.

The surplus food production of one region should be made available in food deficit regions in such way that they it is accessed even by the most disadvantaged group. To ensure proper access, there is a need of developing effective distribution systems and market channels and increasing investment to output market. Food security-friendly import-export policy should be introduced.

To solve the problem of food insecurity, we not only should focus on food system but also on other factors that are related to food security. The attributing factors are women’s education, women’s active participation in agricultural activities, lifestyle, culture, access to health services and basic sanitation among others. These factors are positively correlated with food security.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost yield by 20-30 per cent, increasing the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 per cent.

This gain in production could lessen the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17 per cent besides increasing women’s income.

The countries that are empowering women tend to see lower rates of stunting (low height for age), the primary measure of chronic under-nutrition. Enhancing women’s control over decision-making in the household translates gender equality into better prospects and greater well-being of children, reducing malnutrition and poverty of future generations.

Post-harvest loss of food is also a major factor causing food wastage. Global organisations have been lobbying with regional and local organisations to reduce the hunger and food insecurity problem to a significant level.

The United Nations has been developing several strategies to promote activities against food insecurity. MDG and SDG have been the major strategic tools through which the UN has planned to reach its goal.

Similarly, the World Food Programme and others have been actively working to achieve the goal of zero hunger. The UN says food production must double by 2050 to meet the demand of the world’s growing population and innovative strategies are needed to help combat hunger.

We must think and act even more boldly and innovatively to accelerate viable solutions for achieving food security more quickly on a global scale.","There is the problem of food insecurity not because the world does not produce enough to feed the population.

After completing close to 50 job applications and facing equal rejections, the 21-year-old Edith Dalton James High School and Camperdown High School past student is now appealing publicly for a job.

The Jamaica Observer learnt of Sayles' plight from her mother, Sophia Thompson, who was a guest at yesterday's launch of the National Poverty Reduction Programme at Spanish Court Hotel in New Kingston.

Thompson was among parents whose children are beneficiaries of the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH).

The event was hosted to outline Jamaica's Vision 2030 plan to reduce the prevalence of poverty to fewer than 10 per cent of the population by 2030.

Thompson, who herself holds seven CSEC subjects but has been unemployed for more than 20 years, said that she has long theorised that it is difficult for the majority of inner-city children to get a fair shot at life.

The family lives in Cassava Piece, a low-income community in St Andrew.

The mother said that Sayles, the eldest of her four children, was fired from her business process outsourcing (BPO) job after just a year. However, Thompson insisted that her daughter's dismissal was a case of victimisation. She also said that her daughter is a hard worker.

She said she was not able to fund Sayles beyond upper sixth form and her brother Zienden beyond lower sixth form. The mother said that she had signed up for a grant from the National Youth Service, but to date has not received a callback from the government-run institution.

“It's difficult and disheartening because they go to school and get their education, did so well, and now they come out and still not into a job. Everywhere she sent her résumé or applied for have rejected her. Sometimes she's at home she cries; sometimes I have to cheer her up. It hurts as a parent to see your child's pain. It hurts,” Thompson told the Observer.

While arguing that getting a job in Jamaica requires “links”, the 40-year-old woman appealed to organisations to reach out to her daughter who, she believes, “will not be a disappointment”.

“It's not only my children who are feeling it. You have others here in the ghetto who are not getting the opportunity. You tell them to get up and go to school; you tell them volunteer their time and when they do and perform well they are met with disappointment. They sign up for the police force from the youth club and not even that they can get through with,” Thompson argued.

After speaking with the mother at her home, the Observer went to downtown Kingston to speak with Sayles, who was attending a BPO training session.

Sayles said that the “typical” responses to her applications she has received from companies range from 'we have received your application' to 'we will call you'.

“It's draining; it's difficult and I am sometimes depressed. I see myself in the media, but I at least need to pursue a university education before I can get there. I am not asking for money; I am asking for a job to work and send myself to school because when you take a loan to go to school, finish and you are not able to get a job, how do you pay back that loan?” she reasoned.

Her passes include food and nutrition, law, sociology, communication studies, Caribbean studies, English language, social studies, home economics, information technology, and mathematics. Some of these she pursued at the CAPE level units one and two.

She also volunteers at the Constant Spring Youth Club where she serves as vice-president. There, she mentors children, for whom she at times uses the money she saved from her former BPO job to provide them with lunch money and dinner in order to prevent them from missing school.

Whenever. she does that she goes without food, she said.

“People wouldn't understand how bad things are; you want a job and how hard and smart you will work if given the opportunity. I'm poor and this might be because of generational poverty, but I'm willing to get rid of that if I get a chance. Right now I am able to meet my basic needs, but when you have to share a room with your 19-year-old brother it's a different story. Where I am now the conditions are not good, but I want to change that if I get a chance,” she stressed.

“I'm asking for help to pursue my dreams, my career. Sometimes people just say, 'Oh, you just want a job'. No, I want to honestly make a better life for myself and my family. I just need a chance. I want to facilitate the kids I mentor. I love them dearly; they see me as a role model and if I can assist them I can break the cycle,” Sayles said.","JUZZLE Sayles worked hard in school and made her mother proud, but despite having 16 Caribbean Examination Council passes she has been unable to secure a job, and her parents are unable to find money for her to pursue further studies.

(ADRIEN BARBIER / AFP)

(AFP) - Mozambique's renewed efforts to solve its spiralling ""secret debt"" crisis have again collapsed, leaving the country struggling to recover its reputation as one of Africa's potential growth hotspots.

Last week, Finance Minister Adriano Maleiane flew to London to present creditors with a long-awaited restructuring plan for the $2.2-billion (1.77 billion euros) debt that Mozambique has defaulted on since last year.

Maleiane presented options including a massive write-down, low interest rates until 2023 and a partial swap for a local long-term debt.

All his proposals were dismissed by the Global Group of Mozambique Bondholders, which says it represents most of the holders of the Eurobond debt and commercial loans to state-owned companies.

The bondholders sharply criticised the proposed repayment plans, saying ""the main lines of debt restructuring do not serve to start any conversation leading to a workable resolution"".

Mozambique was forced to admit in 2016 that the loans had been kept secret and were spent on maritime and military ships and equipment.

The government later said it did not disclose the huge loans as they were a matter of national security, allegedly linked to unrest between 2013 and 2016 that echoed the country's civil war, which ended in 1992.

- Waiting for the windfall -

The debts were supposed to be repaid via an anticipated windfall from recently discovered natural gas deposits -- but that has so far failed to materialise.

Mozambique's latest repayment proposals ""were specially prepared for creditors, ignoring everything else"", Celeste Banze, of the Mozambique Public Integrity Centre, told AFP.

""It threatens the wellbeing of the Mozambican people in the present and in the future.

""The government has overly optimistic expectations regarding the collection of revenues from gas that may or may not be effective given price volatility.""

When news of the secret loans broke, major donors -- including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank -- suspended aid to the southern African nation, pitching it into further economic hardship.

Economic growth fell from 6.6 percent in 2015 to 3.7 percent in 2017, with government debt soaring to 112 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of last year.

The IMF this month issued a report blaming the country's economic woes partly on ""undisclosed loans in the spring of 2016 and the ensuing freeze in donor support"".

Last year an audit by New York-based forensic accountants Kroll compounded the crisis when it concluded that $500 million of the $2 billion borrowed from foreign banks including Credit Suisse was still unaccounted for.

- Nagging political hangover -

The loans were taken out under the previous government of Armando Guebuza, but the political hangover has dominated the reign of President Filipe Nyusi.

With an eye on fragile voter support, Nyusi is seen as reluctant to expose those in the ruling Frelimo party responsible for the debt scandal -- a stance that prevents the IMF beginning an aid package.

""Nyusi is currently positioned to narrowly win the 2019 presidential election but will need to ensure that senior Frelimo members are not implicated in the secret debt scandal,"" said the Eurasia risk consultancy.

""Therefore he will be forced to ignore the demands of the IMF and donors for further disclosures.""

The opposition Renamo group, which has been growing its support and hopes to receive a major boost at local polls later this year, has described the debt as illegal and void.

""We cannot pay debt that does not belong to Mozambicans. Using gas revenue to pay off debt is macabre -- you can't use a nation's resources to pay illegal debts,"" Renamo spokesman Jose Manteigas told AFP.

""We want criminal accountability of people who have contracted the debt and those who have diverted money for illicit purposes.""

Venancio Mondlane, an MP for the opposition Mozambique Democratic Movement, said the government, prosecutors and the ruling party were working together to ""thwart any attempt at accountability"".

He also called for the creditors to be held responsible under international law for the ""illegitimate"" loans.

The debt has already built up $636 million in arrears -- but revenues from the new gas fields are only predicted to kick-in by 2023.

For now, Mozambique and its debt holders have little choice but to continue talks despite their differences, with another meeting planned in April.

The Global Group of Mozambique Bondholders said it hoped to soon begin negotiations ""in good faith to achieve a fair settlement"".

Meanwhile, there is little hope on the horizon of any real change for the nearly 50 percent of Mozambicans who live in poverty, according to World Bank statistics.

Mtshweni, who is cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC, tops the list of three names of those to take over until the general elections next year, but said she has no ambitions for the job.

The provincial executive committee has also submitted the names of Social Development MEC Busi Shiba and Agriculture MEC Vusi Shongwe (also ANC treasurer), to the national executive committee to consider for the vacancy left by Mabuza.

Mabuza appointed Mtshweni to act in his position whenever he was not available, but it caused a furore among opposition political parties.

Mabuza’s spokesperson, Zibonele Mncwango, said that the former premier appointed Mtshweni as acting premier in the morning on Wednesday and he then resigned in the afternoon.

“Nothing was wrong. It was Mabuza’s right as a premier to appoint somebody to act in his position,” Mncwango said.

Mabuza’s decision was later ratified by the Mpumalanga executive council and Mtshweni was sworn in again on Thursday.

A provincial executive committee member, who spoke anonymously, said that Mtshweni was not seen as a threat when she acted as premier because she had no ambitions to lead the ANC.

“The three names were submitted to the national executive committee on Thursday and she is number one on the list. For the transitional period, she is okay because she is not a force in ANC structures. She’s not even in the provincial executive committee,” he said.

Mtshweni was, according to insiders, expected to reshuffle her cabinet on Friday afternoon but she did not. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Education MEC Reginah Mhaule as international relations deputy minister last week Monday and that left a vacancy in the Mpumalanga cabinet.

City Press has been reliably informed that the delay in appointing a new cabinet had a lot to do with discussions among the candidates contesting to replace Mabuza.

One of the contenders for the ANC provincial chairpersonship, Mandla Msibi, who is City of Mbombela speaker and a provincial executive committee member, was expected to be deployed as MEC but he declined.

Msibi, a source told City Press, wanted to work in the ANC. He was negotiating with ANC secretary and acting chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu, to withdraw and rather contest as secretary.

Ndlovu was in pole position to succeed Mabuza after Mabuza himself announced last week that he trusted Ndlovu to leave the ANC in his hands. It is believed that Mabuza still wields power in provincial ANC structures and Ndlovu’s prospects look good.

With Msibi out of the chairpersonship contest, Ndlovu will now square off with Lucky Ndinisa (former ANC secretary), Peter Nyoni (cooperative governance and traditional affairs department head), Fish Mahlalela (member of Parliament), David Dube (Mpumalanga legislature member), and Charles Makola (former deputy chairperson).

It’s likely though that more discussions could take place to trim down the number of contestants when the provincial general council sat early next month.

ANC insiders have also told City Press that irrespective of who became ANC chairperson, it was now time for Mpumalanga to have a woman premier because the province had not had one.

The contenders were likely to have a woman as a running mate in order for them take over as premier in 2019.

The imminent cabinet reshuffle, insiders said, could see Mpumalanga legislature speaker Thandi Shongwe getting a post in the executive as social development MEC. Deputy speaker Violet Siwela could be speaker and her deputy could be South African Communist Party provincial secretary, Bonakele Majuba.

Shiba could be moved to human settlements and the current MEC, Speedy Mashilo, could go to cooperative governance and traditional affairs. Public Works MEC, Sasekani Manzini, could be moved to replace Mhaule.

Ndlovu was not available to confirm if the cabinet reshuffle would take place.","Mabuza’s decision was later ratified by the Mpumalanga executive council and Mtshweni was sworn in again on Thursday.

But the shift following the promulgation of the constitution to historic elections is showing that society is rethinking and redefining what it means to lead

There is a swell of change around the world that is shaking up gender roles and amplifying women’s voices into the mainstream, from small moments to large movements. Millions of people marched for women in the United States, while one lone protester was heard from the streets of Iran. The United Nations’ top management reached gender parity, while one family chose school over marriage for their daughter in Nepal.

From one voice to millions, women and men are collectively demanding progress with gender equality and taking steps towards it.

In Nepal, this ground-swell for women’s rights, equality and justice has resulted in significant changes. The 2017 elections saw a historic number of women running and becoming elected officials, from the local level in the Gau and Nagar Palikas to the Provincial Assemblies and National Parliament. More than 14,000 women have taken up office. Many of these women are not professional politicians, but they come from every corner of Nepali society: small entrepreneurs, farmers, mothers, teachers. They were all motivated to actively participate in decisions that affect them, their families, their communities and their livelihoods.

Also in 2017, new legislation and policies were developed outlawing harmful practices like chhaupadi, sexual harassment, and violence against women. This changing political landscape has women and men working together to push women’s rights forward.

But decisions about women’s lives do not just belong to those in Singha Durbar, it’s also essential for people from the most remote communities, to the bustling centre of Pokhara to weigh in on the decisions that affect their lives and the lives of their mothers, daughters, sisters, and neighbours, because legislation and policies are just words on paper if not acted upon.

Parents who send their daughters to school instead of marrying them off, families who reject chhaupadi, and couples who don’t practise dowries, all influence the society around them.

This powerful momentum is what makes this International Women’s Day so special. There is a seismic shift in gender equality, women’s empowerment and inclusion that is undeniable. But the #PressforProgress must not abate. With this landmark election, Nepalis sent a message that women can and should lead. When leadership is inclusive, decisions are inclusive.

Nepal has ingrained traditions and seats of power that are occupied by the same sectors of society. But the aforementioned shift following the 2015 promulgation of the constitution to the historic 2017 elections is showing that society is rethinking and redefining what it means to lead.

Inclusive leaders are those women and men who measure their success in the reflection of the well-being of others and who lead collectively. This means that women who farm know what climate change is doing to their harvests and lands; they can govern from a place of environmental sensitivity; and they understand small-yield agriculture’s contribution to the economy, and how poverty impacts progress.

This means that a person with disabilities knows how difficult it is to catch a bus in the city; they can govern knowing that improved urban transportation and ease of mobility can allow others to lead healthy and prosperous lives, and provide safety and security. The list goes on.

In Nepal, as women take leadership positions in the various spheres of government, they need to define how they will take forward their role as leaders in their communities. To do this, they will need time, time to undertake new dimensions of decision making—with both the risks and gains that new experiences bring. They will also need the support of colleagues, communities and families, as well as respect for and recognition of their expertise and added-values. They must be given the space and support to fulfill the promises and aspirations they brought with them into their new roles and awakened in others through their election.

Gender equality does not happen overnight; it is a process, lengthy, often painful, and at times, we discover that we continue to fight battles long after we thought we were at the finishing line. But to take those essential steps towards gender equality and the realisation of the rights of women, we must have strong leaders, advocates for change, who lead by example. Nepal needs leaders in each of its seven provinces and 753 local bodies who measure their success as leaders through the transformation they see in moving towards a more equal and just society.

Interview by Anthony Manduca

The Malta Country Report 2018 certainly presents a robust picture of the Maltese economy. What do you consider to be the main challenges for economic performance to be sustained, and how are you addressing them?

The economy’s components are its main economic sectors such as financial services, iGaming and tourism, and we have to ask if they are sustainable. I believe they are. In iGaming, for example, we are part of a cluster of the most advanced countries in the world, which collaborate and see the challenges ahead. That is why they are successful, because they always pre-empt the market and consider problems as challenges.

The same can be said for financial services, which are well established and where we have developed professionals in the field of international standard, whether legal, auditing, accounting or IT. The same goes for tourism: we can hold an international conference of any size and can easily cope. In other words we have reached international standard and therefore have a better future. There will be challenges, but I believe our economic growth is not a momentary thing.

The report includes surveys which show corruption is perceived to be problematic for conducting business in Malta. Are you worried that corruption, real or perceived, can end up ruining our economy?

It would be foolish of me to say there is no real corruption in Malta, but I don’t believe there is more corruption now than before. People used to turn a blind eye, nowadays we are more aware. It’s like sexual harassment or domestic violence: people don’t accept these things anymore. Can one say domestic violence is on the increase just because there are more reports? When we say perception it doesn’t mean it is not real, we mean people are more aware, they won’t accept it as much as before. The real undercurrent activity I believe is not higher or lower than before.

Nowadays more questions are asked and there are more chances of being caught.

The European Banking Authority has opened an inquiry into the MFSA’s supervision of Pilatus Bank and its due diligence checks on the initial €8 million in capital used by the bank’s chairman, Seyed Ali Sadr Hasheminejad, who is now under arrest in the US, to set up the bank. Doesn’t this reflect badly on the MFSA?

The EBA is conducting a review of our supervisory institutions, the MFSA and the FIAU, because they were asked to do so by the Commission, and the Commission was asked by MEP David Casa and his colleagues on the Pana Committee. The Pana Committee raised its awareness about Malta because it was pushed on political grounds.

The EBA didn’t wake up one morning and say, “I don’t like what is happening in Malta.” It was at the end of a chain of events. And I am very pleased that somebody from outside, independent and more objective than some other sources in the institutions, will look into it and hopefully be able to report, and we will get to know that our professionals and institutions are really first rate.

Would you agree, though, that his arrest on money-laundering and sanction-busting charges shows a serious failure of banking supervision in Malta?

Not at all, it was about an activity carried out correctly in the US, because it was at war with Iran and therefore has sanctions. These are not even UN sanctions, they are US sanctions, and the law is very severe. This person, who is Iranian, [Mr Hasheminejad] built, or his family built, 7,000 houses in Venezuela and he broke the sanctions because he used the US financial system.

Now, he is going to be brought to justice, and there are a number of things which can be learnt from this indictment. It took five years, even though you had the richest country in the world, with the best intelligence resources in the world, for a single person to be indicted. Nobody tried to rush them, saying they are too slow and citing leaked documents.

One can surmise that there might be links of money in the bank which might be of interest to the US authorities because of connections and other things. That is why the MFSA was very prudent in its decision first to remove all the voting rights from the chairman and also in prohibiting the directors or their relatives from moving assets from the bank, because you need to protect those monies.

There is a new chairman appointed by the MFSA to continue managing the bank.

Because there is a story and there are allegations, the only link is the same person. On the one hand we have a clear indictment with proof, with incidents, with banks in New York and Switzerland. All these are detailed. On the other we still have a half-baked, how should I say, ‘investigation’.

Which one are you taking about?

We are looking at the sanctions, the United States one, and you are tying it to the allegations from newspapers and bloggers about the same bank.

This is my point, it’s not like this came out of the blue. Pilatus has been mentioned many times, and there have been FIAU reports. A 2016 FIAU inspection found “glaring, possibly deliberate disregard” for money-laundering controls at Pilatus Bank.

This is from a leaked document.

Yes, from a leaked document. This was followed by a subsequent FIAU visit, which found that the issues it had identified “no longer subsist”.

Also, another FIAU report, passed on to the police in 2016, made reference to intelligence it had about a criminal investigation into Mr Hasheminejad in a “foreign jurisdiction”. So the word was out that he was being investigated. And there have been other reports as well…

You are saying that when he applied in 2012 and 2013…

No, I am not saying that. At that time there were none of these reports. I am saying that subsequently, there were reports, so it’s not like it [his arrest in the US] came out of the blue.

Nothing was done in those years.

But the reports are not related to the sanctions. The allegation [in the US] is that money was laundered in violation of sanctions, there is money laundering for drug dealing, for armaments, for tax evasion. In this case the money laundering was related to breaking the sanctions.

I understand that, but my point is that there have been documents released, leaked FIAU reports, which have brought into question, not regarding sanctions, but other activities...

You are talking about the bank now, not the person.

Yes, Pilatus Bank, and there have been reports linking it to Keith Schembri and money laundering, so it’s not like people should be surprised that this person is in jail. And nothing was done.

It’s a fact that it’s the same person in these two stories. But consider that the US, the richest country in the world, which has the best intelligence services, perhaps Israel would be a close second, and it still took five years. Can you imagine if after a year somebody from the US leaks documents and people demand that the regulator withdraws the licence of a bank? An investigation has to be carried out to its end.

What we are having now, and it’s not just for Pilatus but BOV and other banks, is a leak takes place and that leak is used against the regulatory institution. They haven’t finished their job. We want the rule of law and at the same time we want to know what the documents are, we want details on those taxpayers, we want details about the regulator. The reason documents are confidential is obvious, you need to carry out an investigation, otherwise it will be contaminated.

The counter-argument is that considering the number of documents that were leaked, nothing was done. Perhaps if they had not been leaked nobody would have known anything about them and no action would have been taken.

I disagree completely. Every time something is leaked, if it wasn’t for that leak nobody would have known anything. Why do we set up regulatory authorities? The law gives them confidentiality for a reason. If the tax reports which a company or people submit were not confidential, people would not be truthful. If you examine the correspondence between the MFSA or other authorities and the economic operators they supervise, these are not nice letters and there are always questions asked.

At the same time we are demoralising these institutions and their professions. The amount of stress brought upon them is tremendous. I know because people tell me. Can you imagine somebody from the FIAU? It was even claimed in Parliament that a certain person at the FIAU must have been bribed. It’s outrageous. I might not be 100 per cent correct but I have full faith in the institutions and I want to strengthen them, to make them look transparent and improve their coordination.

Another FIAU report said there was a “high level of familiarity” between Keith Schembri and the owner of Pilatus Bank. It also said that “Mr Schembri took a personal interest in the licensing of Pilatus Bank under the Banking Act”. Was there a political hand in granting Pilatus a licence in the first place?

I have full faith in the institutions and want to strengthen them, make them look transparent

Tell that to KPMG and Camilleri Preziosi. They will tell you how political it was, they must have been in it. I am sure they did the due diligence correctly. The licence was given by the MFSA, and who was at the MFSA at that time? The same people who were there before 2013, and they remained there for three years. Nothing changed, and did I interfere? Ask them. There is the implication that this government gave a licence to Pilatus Bank for whatever reason one can think of. All I know is that the MFSA gave the bank its licence when the board was the same one appointed by the previous administration. I have full trust in them and I think they did a good job given the circumstances. The licence was granted 11 months after an application was submitted.

Having said all this, don’t you think lessons need to be learnt in the specific case of Pilatus?

All the time, but not from Pilatus.

Wouldn’t you like to find out what happened, who was responsible for it and to make sure it won’t happen again?

Not with Pilatus, I am talking about our whole financial institutions. The first priority is financial stability. If you lose that you lose everything. Today with tax evasion we are learning that there is money laundering. In other words money which you get from illegal means and wash it in a way that it becomes clean. In the institutions I’ve served in, the MFSA, the Central Bank, we always worked towards strengthening our system and we were proud of our work. Today we are tested more and more.

This is why I stand by the various missions we have, whether it’s the rating agencies, the IMF, the European Commission’s Country Report, Moneyval – which does a thorough review of money laundering in Malta. We started with Moneyval in 1998, when they told us to strengthen our legislation. Now that we have the whole framework the comment is “Where’s the beef? You don’t have enough offences reported and criminal proceedings.” So you have to ask yourself why.

This makes us strengthen not destroy those institutions. You’ve got the MFSA, the FIAU. Rather than breaking their morale and throwing them to the dogs, you strengthen them by getting professional help. We got professional help from a renowned international organisation to do a risk assessment. Some sectors are high risk, others medium and others low. Nobody would refute that iGaming is medium to high risk, which is why we have an authority devoted to it.

We will soon be facing blockchain and fintech, with higher risk still, so we need a programme, a strategy and a plan, which will be announced after Easter.

Considering all we know about Pilatus…

I don’t know what you know…

The allegations, the FIAU reports…

As a minister I have to rely on the people at the institutions. I know who is on the board, I trust them, they are professional and experienced, to the extent that they have led and chaired European institutions. If I don’t trust them do I take the post myself?

People have left the FIAU, there have been allegations by Jonathan Ferris…

I know the explanation. It’s the pressure from both sides. I don’t just mean name calling but the political pressure, some just can’t stand it. Maybe I can, but some people weren’t meant to face political pressure of that kind. Some people are contemplating moving out because of the pressure, including pressure from the media.

So you’re saying that your conscience is clear about the fact that over the years Pilatus Bank was left to operate, and now this has happened in the US? I am not saying there is a direct link between the sanctions busting and the bank in Malta, but many consider this to be the last straw.

And what are you doing to restore Malta’s reputation in the financial sector?

Why is it that we are picking on Pilatus Bank but we are not placing the same emphasis on another bank, which has had – and there is proof of it, by the European supervisor and also the local supervisor – bad governance, to the extent that they had to appoint an administrator and pull the plug? Nobody is talking about it. Nemea Bank. There is complete silence. What happened there? What sort of bad governance was it? The directors, who were very high-profile people, resigned quietly, and that’s the end of the story. So for me it’s double standards to place so much emphasis on one bank, because for me bad governance is bad governance.

Money laundering is bad, but also losing one’s pension is bad. We had a Swedish Fund, registered in Malta, the director was Maltese, but the CEO wasn’t and he made a mess and lost money. That is criminal, as much as money laundering. I don’t know anything about Pilatus unless the authorities involved press charges on proof, not on a document which was leaked and given to the Opposition. A real whistleblower, if he can’t trust the police, if he can’t trust his institutions, if he can’t trust anybody, but if he trusts the courts, would go to court.

If he goes to the Leader of the Opposition two weeks before the election, I would say wait a minute, I’m not so sure.

Simon Busuttil went to court because he felt he had no alternative.

Whoever gave Simon Busuttil the documents should have sent them to court, but he trusted the Leader of the Opposition. Isn’t that political?

Vitals deal: ‘No project is smooth sailing’

Taxpayers still don’t know how the millions forked out by the government on the Vitals hospital project were spent. Can you enlighten them?

This project was handled by Projects Malta, where the contract, which was a concession, was given to Vitals. Because it was a concession it wasn’t handled by Contracts, but by Projects Malta, from beginning to end. The contract was approved by Cabinet, and the Finance Ministry has to abide by the Cabinet’s decision and pay – of course we had presentations as well, to show how it is going to work, and during the first three years when it is still being constructed, there was a formula, while after that date when the hospitals are fully running, there is another formula where the government buys and pays for the beds. That’s practically the contract. There were issues with payments or delivery, and the Cabinet gave breathing space because it was given information that a deal was imminent and things would be sorted. I have a budget and I abide by the budget.

You are responsible for the public purse. Do you think the taxpayer got value for money for that spending?

I stand to be corrected, but roughly 85 per cent if not 90 per cent of those monies went into wages, in other words the employees of the Gozo, St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals, who were paid through Vitals. However, I am informed that Steward Health Care, who are taking over, are taking over with not only the assets but also the liabilities. So if they still owe the government, because what they owe is for the construction of the hospitals, it should be delivered by whoever bought these shares into it.

When you talk about a project you don’t talk about the first three years. I have been on various company boards, there is what is called a break-even, when you are in the third year and you start making a profit. This project is for the benefit of Malta, where you have a private sector injection, something which is new for Malta, and one has to evaluate it over the medium term.

Do you think the Vitals deal could have been handled better? Could it have been more transparent? Nobody really knows who is behind the company, which has no experience at all in healthcare.

Is this the way our public hospitals should be treated? Who are these people?

If it were me, I would have liked it to be more transparent

When I was involved in the major bridge loan for Electrogas, which was justified and market oriented, and the Commission was to be informed, I gave a press conference. However, when you are not involved in a project yourself, in the negotiations, you don’t know who the other side is and to what extent the negotiations are of a commercial nature, I can’t judge. If it were me, I would have liked it to be more transparent. I wasn’t there myself to judge whether it was wrong.

No project is smooth sailing. If you ask, “Could it have been handled better?” it’s very easy to say “Yes.”

So you do believe that the project could have been more transparent?

Yes, with hindsight everybody is wiser.

At what stage are the nego-tiations with Steward Health Care?

I am not involved. It’s under the Health Ministry. That’s why we have a big Cabinet. I understand discussions are going on. Obviously we are consulted, and my permanent secretary works closely with the permanent secretary at the Health Ministry. It’s only when I need to be flagged for a particular reason that I am involved. If you ask me if it would have been better to start dealing with Steward instead of Vitals, it’s very obvious. But these are observations with hindsight. When you are trying your best, things do not come in a straight line.","Finance Minister Edward Scicluna says there is no more corruption now than there was before and defends the regulatory institutions in the wake of the arrest of the Pilatus Bank chairman in the US.
It would be foolish of me to say there is no real corruption in Malta, but I don’t believe there is more corruption now than before.
It also said that “Mr Schembri took a personal interest in the licensing of Pilatus Bank under the Banking Act”.
There is the implication that this government gave a licence to Pilatus Bank for whatever reason one can think of.

The World now has a population of 7.6 billion people on 7 continents. The pursuit of a peaceful and prosperous world has no meaning until violence against women comes to an end. The global quest for genuine development and sustainable democracy would remain an illusion until the gap of inequity and inequality is bridged.

Even as we observe this year’s International Women Day, there are millions of women and girls who remain vulnerable to social, economic, political, psychological and physical abuse. Today, 1 in 5 women has been sexually and physically abused while at least 200 women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation or cutting in 30 countries.

We live in a world where 750 million women alive were married before 18 years old and 250 million of them were married before 15 years old. Is this the world that has promised equal opportunities for all, especially women and girls? It is unimaginable for approximately 15 million women 15–19 years old give birth each year, about 11% births worldwide.

It is painful to celebrate this IWD when 120 million girls have had forced sexual intercourse with husbands, partners or boyfriends while 83 percent of girls aged 12 to 16 experience some form of harassment in public schools. Even while we are celebrating International Women’s Day, approximately 130 million girls are out of school worldwide with over 250,000 rape cases from just 65 countries in 12 months.

There can be no PEACE in the world when 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not yet considered a crime. There is still over 60 million girls worldwide who are child brides, married before the age of 18. Even as we speak, there are women in different parts of the world who are being sexually harassed and abused. For instance, a woman is raped in every 15 minutes in India.

As we browse through these scaring and vexing statistics released by UN Women, we must be overly provoked to go beyond words and act to defend our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and nieces. We (men) are more than them in terms global population. Therefore, we can reverse these harsh realities if each one of us decides to take an action to protect women and girls.

Women and girls deserve far better than what they go through every day. Without women, our one world would have been no more. They are our future and pride. They are destiny and hope. We must never abuse them in any form or manner. We must lift them up and give them the space to compete and pursue their dreams. Until this happens, the world stands to risk a lot.

It is not enough to celebrate IWD every year when rape, force marriage, trafficking, child prostitution, teenage pregnancy, female genital mutilation, sexual assault and domestic violence remain prevalent. In our generation, we must find concrete remedy to all forms of violence against women and girls.

For instance, Liberia had 803 rape cases just between January 2015 and March 2016 according to UN Human Rights Office. Liberian men, what are we doing to mitigate this emerging dilemma? What are we doing to protect our women and girls? Eliminating violence against women and girls is essential to promoting peace, safety, harmony and genuine development worldwide. Anything less than this, our generation has failed.

Stand up men and go out there to rescue and inspire a female. Let this year’s IWD be different. Henceforth, all of us have an inescapable responsibility to pledge our ultimate loyalty to womanhood. Until we create a friendly space of equality and equity for women, we have no future as men. Our destiny is tied to the destiny of every woman.

Protecting women’s rights is fundamental to securing a prosperous future. No nation encounters true prosperity when women and girls remain vulnerable to socio-economic peril. There is no developed nation that has succeeded without the protection women’s rights and their full participation in decision-making. The world has no future when women remain vulnerable to all forms of abuse.

It really does not matter where you are, what you have, or who you are before reaching out to woman, but what matters is your selfless demonstration to guarantee better condition for vulnerable women. There are millions of women today living in desperate conditions who are in need of help/assistance. We must go beyond words and romantic speeches on this IWD, and begin to act rapidly to intervene before it gets too late.

All through my life, I have not seen any group of people that are so vulnerable like women and girls. According to history, women and girls have been mostly exposed to countless number of risks and dangers. In some quarters, they are usually seen as non-entities and immaterial characters simply because of their gender or sex.

They are overlooked, marginalized, trafficked, and suppressed every other day around the world as a result of antiquated cultural practices, low self-esteem, poverty, economic inequality, and insufficient opportunities. It is about time we begin to exhibit a strong sense of willingness to rescue all women and girls who are mostly entrapped, abused and harassed by cruel elements.

The need to protect the rights of girls and women is an unavoidable imperative for any productive society. Women and girls are like precious jewels and if we intentionally fail to create the necessary opportunities for them, we hurt ourselves as a nation and harm our future as a people.

I am one of those who strongly believe that women and girls can bring down mountains and transcend valleys. I am one of those who believe that women and girls can perform even better than their male counterparts. I am one of those who believe that women and girls can make the difference by providing great leadership in this age and time. It makes no sense for anyone to underestimate the unparalleled abilities of women and girls.

The endless contribution of women and girls around the world is not only esteemed, but extraordinary.

If this assertion is an unarguable reality, then why must we continue to abuse women and girls? Why must we continue to deny women and girls from accessing equal opportunities? I thought gender equality is the cornerstone for mutual co-existence. I thought justice for rape victims is the basis for global peace and genuine development.

If this is true, state actors must begin to invest more resources in women empowerment and girls’ education. The time to empower all women is now. The world must ensure to achieve PLANET 50-50 by 2030. As a Liberian youth activist, I remain committed to this worthy global campaign. If we truly believe that women have a future, then we cannot be back-benchers. It is time to walk side-side with them into that future we envisage.

We cannot continue to preach the gospel of gender equity and equality through words and rhetoric. It comes with policy measures and implementation. Women and girls must be given a friendly space to compete with their male counterparts. If this is done, Liberia will regain its rightful status among comity of nations. Until we can understand that women and girls have extraordinary abilities to make positive impact in society, our nation stands to risk its destiny.

Have we forgotten about great women and feminists around the world whose legacies are unmatched even today? It is our obligation to always remember the priceless contribution of Harriet Tubman, Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale, Maggie Andrew Thatcher, Rosa Park, Sojourner Truth, Queen Victoria, and many other feminists who changed the world. Certainly, the enviable marks of these women on mankind will always be cherished even beyond this generation.

On this day in observance of IWD, I want to remember little Angel Togba who was raped and strangulated to death in February 2008 in Liberia. I also want to remember Chibok’s girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram in April 2014 in Nigeria. It is time to collectively act, respond to and prevent any further violence/abuse against women.

Our pledge to protect women worldwide must now find concrete meaning in this year’s 2018 theme of International Women’s Day “Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming women’s lives”. Happy IWD to all women.

58,https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201803201062729599-iraq-15th-anniversary-war/,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sputnik International,"The Iraq War 15 Years On: No Body Count, No Accountability, No End in Sight","A full fifteen years on from the US/UK invasion of Iraq, one could be forgiven for thinking the conflict never happened. No government minister of the day has faced any repercussions for their role in the war, no official body count has ever been determined, and no one is quite sure whether the intervention was legal or not.

March 20 2018 marks the 15th anniversary of the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the US-led invasion of Iraq. Despite the UK playing a leading and pivotal role in the conflict, with around 45,000 troops (roughly 19 percent of the invasion force) remaining in the country until 2009, the mainstream British media has been largest silent about the momentous commemoration.

The anniversary is unlikely to go unremarked upon in Iraq itself — although the friends and families of those slain in the 15 years since the initial invasion are unlikely to be celebrating.

Who's Counting

Calculating the true number of deaths produced by the Iraq War is an inexact science — General Tommy Franks, who led the invasion, told reporters in 2003 the US military ""don't do body counts."" Given official refusal to keep an ongoing tally, the task has fallen to medical professionals with experience of conducting comprehensive mortality studies in major warzones.

© AP Photo / Tony Nicoletti/Pool Alex Matheson, left, a member of the Desert Rats with his Challenger II tank man an operational post in Basra, southern Iraq, Friday April 4, 2003

The first professional estimate was published in medical journal The Lancet in 2006 — it estimated about 600,000 Iraqis were killed in the first 40 months of war and occupation in Iraq, along with 54,000 non-violent but still war-related deaths.

US and UK officials publicly condemned the report, criticising its methodology and suggesting its calculations were wildly exaggerated. However, behind closed doors the UK government acknowledged the report was ""likely to be right"". A 2015 Physicians for Social Responsibility report — Casualty Figures After 10 Years of the ‘War on Terror — also found The Lancet paper more reliable than other mortality studies conducted in Iraq.

© AP Photo / Yonhap/Jin Sung-chul A US soldier looks through a pair of binoculars as a fire in the Rumeila oil field burns in the background in southern of Iraq, Sunday, March 30, 2003.

Just Foreign Policy's ""Iraqi Death Estimator"" updated the study's estimate, multiplying passively reported deaths compiled by NGO Iraq Body Count by the same ratio documented in 2006. This project was discontinued in September 2011 — then, its estimate of Iraqi deaths stood at 1.45 million.

Complicating the picture are arguments over whether casualties produced by the US-led coalition in their battle against Daesh since 2014 should be included in the total — and the fact such killings continue to the present day. The campaign has seen 105,000 bombs and missiles dropped on Iraq in under four years.

Several cities held or once held by the group have been reduced to rubble, and Iraqi-Kurdish intelligence has estimated at least 40,000 civilians died in the assault on Mosul alone. In recent months, an attempt to clean up the rubble in the ancient city found 3,353 more bodies, of whom only 20 percent were identified as ISIS fighters — the rest were civilians.

© AP Photo This is an image obtained by The Associated Press which shows a detainee bent over with his hands on the bars of a prison cell watched by a soldier in late 2003 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, Iraq

Still, whatever the numerical reality, Iraq Body Count's summary of the war's impact on Iraqi civilians is stark.

""An entire generation of Iraqi children has known little other than life in a country riven by violence, fear, hopelessness, internal displacement and poverty, [and] is growing up deprived of basic security or well grounded hope, a generation of the orphaned and dispossessed. Let us in the West have the courage to face this truth and accept the role we played in it, so that we may at last make meaningful efforts to help solve rather than compound these problems,"" the NGO wrote.

Moreover, the organization bemoaned how Western publics had seemingly become ""ever more inured and desensitized to Iraqi suffering.""

""[This is] in part thanks to the creeping ‘normality' of the relentless daily death toll. ‘Everyday' violence makes poor news copy, especially when it's happening far away and to no one we know. We in the West have a responsibility to become more fully aware of the experienced realities of a nation and a people whose fates we have so significantly altered. After 15 years of never-ending bloodshed, is it not now finally time for our governments to join and support the efforts of Iraqi civil society and NGOs to accurately and comprehensively document the full extent of the harms suffered by the people of Iraq?"" Iraq Body Count concluded.

Legal Arguments

Ever since March 20 2003, the legality of the war has been hotly debated. While attempts to prosecute officials responsible for planning and executing the war have been unsuccessful, there is significant consensus that the war constituted a ""crime of aggression"".

© REUTERS / Peter Nicholls A demonstrator wearing a mask to impersonate Tony Blair holds throws fake money during a protest before the release of the John Chilcot report into the Iraq war, at the Queen Elizabeth II center in London, Britain July 6, 2016.

The list of public figures supporting this view is large and seemingly ever-growing, and includes then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan , former US Attorney-General Ramsey Clark , former chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix , former Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister 2010 — 2015 Nick Clegg John Prescott , Deputy Prime Minister at the time of the invasion, also supports this view.

Sir Michael Wood, senior legal adviser at the Foreign Office in 2003, advised the government intervention without UN approval was ""contrary to international law"". His deputy, Elizabeth Wilmshurst, resigned in protest on the eve of the invasion. She subsequently told the Iraq Inquiry, a public investigation of the war conducted 2009 — 2011 that finally published its findings in July 2016, all Foreign Office lawyers ""dealing with the matter were entirely of one view"".

© AFP 2021 / Jeff J Mitchell Iraq Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot speaks as he comments on the findings of his report, inside the QEII Centre in London on July 6, 2016.

While the Inquiry's resultant report did not deem the invasion illegal, it did note Prime Minister Tony Blair asked Parliament to ""endorse a decision to invade and occupy a sovereign nation, without the support of a United Nations Security Council resolution explicitly authorising the use of force"" — the lack of such a resolution would make the invasion illegal under international law, as Wood noted.

Limited Liability

Despite this, at the official level in Britain, one could be forgiven for thinking the conflict never happened. No government minister of the day has faced any repercussions for their role in the war.

Only one — Leader of the House Robin Cook — resigned in immediate protest of the war, and all others backed it. Clare Short, International Development Secretary — who called Blair ""reckless"" in the lead up to the war — resigned in May. Since then, she has become chair of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Despite his subsequent repudiation of the war's legality, John Prescott remained Deputy Prime Minister until Blair's resignation in 2007, whereupon he joined the House of Lords. There, as Baron Prescott, he sits by other cabinet contemporaries who also backed the war, including David Blunkett, Paul Boateng, Alastair Darling, Tessa Jowell and John Reid.

Many ministers were also subsequently promoted — Margaret Beckett became Foreign Secretary, Darling Chancellor, Reid Defense Secretary and Straw Justice Secretary.

Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister in 2007, going on to become Official Special Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East until 2015. Chancellor Gordon Brown became UN Special Envoy on Global Education.

It's not merely ministers who saw their fortunes rise in the wake of the invasion. Matthew Rycroft, Blair's private secretary, who drafted the infamous ""Downing Street memo"", went on to serve as UK ambassador to the UN, and in 2018 was promoted to Permanent Secretary at the Department for International Development.

Make it seven.

College faculty members and their colleagues rallied in Albany on Tues., Apr. 24th to demand a salary of $7,000 per course for adjunct faculty of the City University of New York (CUNY) and called for increased investment in the country’s largest urban university system.

CUNY relies on 12,000 adjunct faculty.

“Fair pay for adjunct faculty at CUNY is an issue of both wage justice and educational justice,” said Barbara Bowen, President of the Professional Staff Congress (PSC).

PSC represents almost 30,000 full- and part-time faculty and professional staff at CUNY.

“Thousands of CUNY faculty members live on near-poverty wages. Some are on food stamps,” said Bowen. “That’s not justice for working people and it’s not justice for CUNY students. Their education is worth more than poverty pay.”

According to PSC, CUNY adjunct lecturers earn an average of $3,500 per course, about a third of what a full-time lecturer earns.

Advocates argued that the lecturers are often forced to work at multiple campuses, making it difficult to offer extra time to their students. They say adjuncts who support themselves exclusively with CUNY positions earn between $20,000 and $32,000 per year, despite their advanced degrees.

“I work full-time hours as an adjunct for near-poverty wages,” said Baruch College adjunct teacher Carly Smith. “Much of the essential work I do, like mentoring and providing individual attention to students, is unpaid. I should never have to choose between volunteering to meet with a student for extra help outside of class and working a paid side job instead. CUNY is in a crisis when the majority of its faculty are forced to make these choices every day.”

Tuesday’s rally on the Capitol’s Million Dollar Staircase was part of a $7K Advocacy Day during which adjuncts met with legislators.

Though CUNY salaries are bargained with the university’s central administration, PSC insists that inadequate funding from Albany is the root case. They note that per-student state investment in CUNY senior colleges has declined 18 percent since 2008, when adjusted for inflation.

“CUNY students deserve professors who are paid fairly and who have working conditions that allow them to give students the time and support essential for academic success,” said Bowen.

Among those who pledged support for the PSC was State Senator Marisol Alcántara.

“I am a proud and angry supporter of CUNY!” she wrote on Twitter during Advocacy Day. “I am angry because there has been a systemic disinvestment in the institution that educates the vast majority of our NYC high school graduates. CUNY offers social mobility for our students from working class families. I stand strong with members of the PSC calling on an increase in pay for our CUNY professors. $7K! $7K! $7K! #CUNYeconomicjustice!”","“Fair pay for adjunct faculty at CUNY is an issue of both wage justice and educational justice,” said Barbara Bowen, President of the Professional Staff Congress (PSC).

Ensconced behind a drawing board in his Manhattan studio, clad in his trademark incompletely buttoned dress shirt and loose tie, Adams is in the midst of recalling the creation of one of his most famous pages. In fact, it’s one of the most notable pages in the history of the American comic book: a scene from 1970’s Green Lantern No. 76 in which an elderly black man accosts the white superhero Green Lantern for being insufficiently attentive to the concerns of people of color.

The page is a deceptively simple collection of words and pictures that, thanks to Adams’s art and writer Dennis O’Neil’s script, altered the course of the superhero genre. Green Lantern — civilian name Hal Jordan — is a human who was long ago drafted into an intergalactic police force by cyan-colored aliens and spends his days battling cosmic villains and palling around with fellow members of the Justice League. That isn’t enough for his accuser, whose wrinkled face is so energized that it spills over from the second panel to the third.

“I been readin’ about you,” he tells GL. “How you work for the blue skins … and how on a planet someplace you helped out the orange skins … and you done considerable for the purple skins! Only there’s skins you never bothered with — the black skins! I want to know … how come?! Answer me that, Mr. Green Lantern!” Adams, an expert in human anatomy, slumps Hal down in the final panel; O’Neil gives the hero a pathetic response to the man’s query: “I … can’t …” No one had played with the dynamite sticks of black dissatisfaction and white guilt like this in the genre before. To put it in contemporary terms, this was the moment superheroes got woke.

At the time, Green Lantern sales had been down in the dumps, and this page helped turn its fortunes around, launching the series to acclaim and unprecedented mainstream media attention. Adams is proud of the page’s message — and just as proud of his draughtsmanship. “People were taught to draw white people and call them black people because they drew their hair a little kinky,” he says. “But that guy is a black guy. You have to draw black people different just like you have to draw Asians different. People are different from one another. That’s what makes the world good. That’s what makes the world great.”

O’Neil is significantly less sentimental when I ask him over the phone to recall his role in making the page. For him, the creation of the now-famed moment was largely business as usual. “We had our tool kits together, we knew how to do this work, and I don’t know how Neal approached it, but for me, this was something that I always kept in mind: it is my job,” he says. “I don’t have the luxury of waiting for inspiration, which probably will never come.”

Therein lies the dichotomy that powered the creation of a great little piece of the comics canon. Its artist thought he and his partner had turned a low-selling series into something revolutionary. But to its writer, it was just another day at the office. They’re both right: For two of the most dynamic creators to ever operate in the medium, simple workmanship was anything but simple.

Both men were liberals who grew up without black people in their orbit. O’Neil was born to an Irish-American family in 1939 and reared in St. Louis. “I lived in an all-white neighborhood, and Irish Catholics do tend to occasionally be guilty of bigotry,” he says. “One of my relatives would turn off the television when there was a black performer on a variety show: ‘Really, they shouldn’t allow them on. Y’know, they don’t have souls!’ That was the kind of background I came from.”

Adams, a Jewish Brooklynite born in 1941, recalls thinking he wasn’t prejudiced until he saw the city beyond his native Coney Island: “I pretended that I was liberal, I pretended that I understood,” he says. “And then you’d go through Harlem and it’s, ‘What are you doing here, white boy?’ And how did that happen? Excuse me, you’re just another guy, right? But you happen to have darker skin and you’re treating me like I put you there. And guess what? I did. I did put you there. That was the reality.”

The industry they ended up in wasn’t a whole lot better in terms of diversity. At the dawn of the ’70s, comics was still primarily a white man’s game. There had been talented black and mixed-race creators over the years, but they were very much the exception, and there wouldn’t be a full-time black superhero comics writer until the early 1980s. Depictions of black people on the page were also lacking. Sure, you had the hypercompetent Black Panther, but he didn’t even have his own series. More often than not, if you saw someone with dark skin in a superhero title, they were a random street tough. On the rare occasions when creators addressed racism, it was in simplistically Manichean terms: the good guys virtuously spouted generic up-with-people rhetoric and the racists were sinister hatemongers like, well, Hate-Monger, a Marvel Comics villain who was literally Hitler.

O’Neil wanted to do something different, and Adams was right behind him. But that doesn’t mean they were friends. Indeed, this now-legendary duo hardly ever met. The two freelancers had been paired up on DC Comics’ Batman-starring Detective Comics to considerable acclaim, but their alchemy happened without contact. “I wrote scripts, and I turned them in to [DC editor] Julie Schwartz, and they disappeared into that black hole of the printing process,” O’Neil recalls. “Julie edited them, he gave them to Neal, and they took it from there.” Nevertheless, they were a hot item, though O’Neil was skeptical about how long the ride would last. “We were the flavors of the week — a characterization Neal would disagree with,” he says.

Here’s where the narrative gets a little dicey. According to Adams, the Green Lantern revival was his idea. He says he wanted a crack at the emerald-shaded super-gent to prove his mettle. The series had, until recently, been drawn by one of the great artists of the era, Gil Kane. “I thought that I could at least take a shot at doing something as good as Gil Kane did,” Adams recalls. “So I thought Green Lantern, of the characters at DC Comics, was the best possibility for really expressing yourself artistically.” The scribe’s version is much more prosaic: O’Neil says Schwartz (who died in 2004) just “had a soft spot” for GL and wanted a Hail Mary attempt at reviving sales for the character’s series, so he recruited the two rising stars.

Whatever the specific chain of events, Schwartz assigned both men to the ailing series and awaited the results. O’Neil mulled the title character over and came to a realization about his essence. “My take on Green Lantern was, he was a kind of cop,” he recalls. “He was, in his own way, an Establishment character. I mean, he wore a uniform, he did what he was told, he answered to bosses.” But in order to explore that idea, “I needed somebody to take the opposite point of view,” he says.

Enter Green Arrow, DC’s other lime do-gooder. Created in 1941, he’d typically been depicted as something of a Batman rip-off: an un-superpowered billionaire playboy with a sideline as a crime-fighter, albeit one who used a bow and arrow. However, Adams had given Arrow — civilian name Oliver Queen — a visual makeover in a series called The Brave and the Bold the previous year and O’Neil had made him lose his fortune in an issue of Justice League soon after. Oliver was, all of a sudden, putty in the two creators’ hands. “I could do with his personality whatever I felt needed doing,” O’Neil says. “So I went with him representing people who are closer to the left, and Green Lantern representing the good conservatives.”

But how would he explore that notion? He chose to pick a topic that was literally close to home. “I was living in a slum,” O’Neil says. He was dwelling in the hellscape that was 1970s downtown Manhattan and chose to have GL and GA encounter urban poverty — particularly black poverty — up close. That said, when I ask him if he felt some kind of progressive fervor while hammering out his story, he demurs. “What that story’s about is something that concerned me as a husband, father, et cetera, et cetera, but at some point, you just sit down and do the job,” he says. “I met the deadline, I got the story in on time, and went to work on the next one.”

By contrast, when Adams received O’Neil’s script, he was enraptured. “It was great. I couldn’t believe it,” Adams says, shaking his head with wonder, even now. “It was a fresh, new view. A story between two men who are politically opposed to each other and morally dysfunctional and fighting, and in effect, letting them fight it out.” He was particularly impressed with how it interrogated the deficiencies both of liberal and conservative viewpoints in the form of the characters: “There was nothing wrong with either one of them at their base, but along the way they had acquired some awfully bad attitudes.” It was decided that the cover of the issue would feature both heroes’ names in equal size, making the issue the first in a run on Green Lantern that is colloquially known as Green Lantern / Green Arrow. Adams got to work.

The finished product is as charmingly quaint as it is bluntly didactic. The opening page shows GL soaring through Green Arrow’s native Star City, as narration informs us, “often he has vowed that ‘no evil shall escape my sight’” but that, ominously, “he has been fooling himself. ” He sees some ruffians beating up a rotund, besuited white man on a street and uses his magic ring to send them to police headquarters. To his surprise, people start pelting him with garbage. GA suddenly appears and tells GL to back off. “Green Arrow,” Hal says. “You’re … defending these … these anarchists?!”

Oliver informs Hal that the man the latter rescued on the street was, in fact, Jubal Slade (what a name!), the local slumlord, who’s planning to tear down a tenement in order to set up a parking lot. Oliver takes Hal on a tour of the blighted structure and shames him for fighting on the side of the “fat cat,” not the impoverished kids who were roughing him up. GL gets defensive: “You’ve no cause to yell at me! I have a job … I do it!” GA counters by going full Godwin’s law: “Seems I’ve heard that line before … at the Nazi war trials!” That’s when the old black man appears and makes his j’accuse. Appropriately shamed, Hal agrees to help Oliver in taking down the landlord, which they eventually do after some crime-fighting mishegoss.

In an epilogue, Lantern’s alien bosses, the Guardians, excoriate him for wasting his time on his mission of social justice. Arrow, on the other hand, argues that their job has only just begun; that, in America, “Something is wrong! Something is killing us all! Some hideous moral cancer is rotting our very souls!” The Guardians concede that he has a point and send one of their number to Earth in human guise to accompany Oliver and Hal on, of all things, a road trip. “There’s a fine country out there someplace! Let’s go find it!” Oliver declares, hopping in a pickup truck. The concluding narration portends a new kind of story going forward: “Three set out together, moving through cities and villages and the majesty of the wilderness … searching for a special kind of truth … searching for themselves …”

The issue was a turning point for the series, and comics as a whole. For the next dozen-odd installments of Green Lantern, Hal, Oliver, and the Guardian encountered an array of social ills: environmental destruction, overpopulation, anti–Native American racism, the evils of the Nixon administration, and Manson-esque hippie cults, just to name a handful. The stories were a public sensation, garnering a write-up in the New York Times (“Shazam! Here Comes Captain Relevant,” read the headline), an analysis in a New York Magazine cover story (“The Radicalization of the Superheroes” was the title), and even a letter from New York City mayor John Lindsay in a much-publicized issue about Green Arrow’s sidekick getting addicted to heroin.

And then, as casually as the whole thing had come together, it dissipated. O’Neil and Adams — who, even at the height of the media circus, still hardly saw each other and rarely discussed stories — moved on to other projects and the Green Lantern / Green Arrow era was over. But its impact resonated in the years and decades that followed. A precedent had been set for superhero comics to address that “hideous moral cancer” that Oliver had talked about, and publishers and creators made repeated attempts to recapture that social relevance. Sometimes, the results were thrilling (Black Panther’s 1976 battle with the KKK, written by Don McGregor and penciled by Billy Graham, for example); other efforts are best left on the dustheap of history (a rape story line in Ms. Marvel leaps to mind, then leaps right out again).

The legacy of the run that began with Green Lantern No. 76 can be felt today in a bevy of progressive-minded superhero tales, from the nuanced religious tolerance of the rebooted Ms. Marvel to the pointed diversity of Lion Forge’s Catalyst Prime lineup. The “black skins” accusation regularly pops up in retrospectives of comics history, and the story in which it was contained has been reprinted over and over again in DC collected editions. Future generations won’t lack for opportunities to find out what all the fuss is about. O’Neil seems almost a little uncomfortable at all the attention paid to stuff he did primarily to earn a paycheck. “I hear about how that was a landmark series and so on,” he tells me, “but I’m looking at a Green Lantern / Green Arrow $75 hardcover edition across the room as we speak, and I certainly never anticipated anything like that.”

On the other side of the coin, Adams relishes the way he and his arm’s-length partner made history. “It made a difference and it woke up generations to the idea that comic books aren’t just for kids,” he says — but emphasizes that he hopes kid readers got the message. “As far as I know, no kid ever bought a children’s book himself with his own money, but they’ll buy comic books. So we better make them good … don’t you think?”","In fact, it’s one of the most notable pages in the history of the American comic book: a scene from 1970’s Green Lantern No.

The heads of government from all the Commonwealth nations have come together in London for the five-day Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which started on April 16. It is to be noted that the venue for CHOGM was relocated from Vanuatu to London after the Pacific island's infrastructure was too badly damaged by Cyclone Pam in 2015. It is one of the Commonwealth nations that are already living with the reality of climate impacts in the form of extreme weather events.

In fact, according to the Germanwatch's latest Climate Risk Index 2017, the top five most affected countries are all Commonwealth nations: Dominica, India, Malawi, Mozambique and Vanuatu.

But, is each Commonwealth nation doing enough to deliver a fair and equitable outcome to protect the most vulnerable nations from climate risk? This question was at the core of the latest report, Climate inequality in the Commonwealth, created by Christian Aid—a development charity—based on the analyses of whether each country in the Commonwealth is taking its ‘fair share’ of global climate action needed to achieve a 1.5°C outcome as enshrined in the Paris Agreement.

The UK, on a per capita basis, burns more carbon dioxide than 18 Commonwealth countries put together, says the report, which is based on the assessment of pledges to the Paris Agreement and measuring them against national capacity and historic emissions since 1990. According to the report, to meet climate obligations, the UK needs to mitigate 700 metric tonnes of C02 internationally by 2030, which equates to 1,730 terawatt hours of renewable electricity. This can almost eradicate energy poverty in the Commonwealth, which currently needs 2,050 terawatt hours (a terawatt-hour refers to getting power at a capacity of 1 terawatt (10^12 watts) for one hour).

Despite this huge carbon footprint, the UK and similar rich nations such as Australia and Canada are failing to do their fair share to prevent climate change. On the contrary, poorer nations such as Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tuvalu are working much harder, the report claims. “Our analysis exposes the climate inequality at the heart of the Commonwealth,” the report argues.

The gap between what is needed to limit global warming and what has been pledged so far by Commonwealth nations is “unbalanced and favours the interests of the rich”.

Unequal share

While the fair share of wealthier Commonwealth nations should be 2.9 Gt CO2e of mitigation, their pledges amount to only 0.9 Gt CO2e, leaving an ‘equity gap’ of 2 Gt CO2e. In contrast, the poorer Commonwealth nations have unconditionally pledged 1.0 Gt CO2e, whereas their fair share is 0.6 Gt CO2e. For example, Australia, whose per capita emission reduction should have been 31.36 tonnes of CO2, has pledged only 8.49 tonnes of CO2 emission reduction. On the contrary, Zambia, whose fair share of emission reduction would have been 0.19 tonnes of CO2, has pledged 2.77 tonnes of CO2.

According to Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's International Climate Lead and one of the authors of the report, the study exposes the hypocrisy behind many of the warm words put out by the rich nations. He cites the UK as an example: ""The UK claims to stand in solidarity with its Commonwealth allies, but when it comes to one of the gravest threats to member nations, it is shirking its responsibilities. The UK is proud of the shared values between the 'family of nations' but it is not pulling its weight and instead is leaving the heavy lifting to much poorer countries. For Britain, the host country, which claims to care for both the climate and the Commonwealth, it risks being embarrassing if it doesn't step up its game.""","It is one of the Commonwealth nations that are already living with the reality of climate impacts in the form of extreme weather events.

Referring to the UN’s concerns about the rising number of people suffering from hunger, WFP officials said that over the past three years, four million more people now face a lack of food security, bringing the total number to 13 million out of about 30 million in the country.

“Now we have 30 million people, the amount of money to address (the problem for) eight million is a huge number,” Beasley said.

According to WFP, from the figure, eight million people are facing a serious risk of hunger. They called on the Afghan government, private sector and the international community to step up efforts to overcome this challenge.

Mirza is an Afghan citizen who has a fast food restaurant in Kabul. He says that in recent years, no work had been done to promote and develop the agriculture sector in the country.

“Over the past few years, the government has done nothing to develop agricultural; if work had been done in this sector, today the people would not be hungry,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) said it is working on a number of programs to promote food security in the country.

“We have outlined a five-year plan for food security. With the implementation of this program, we will overcome a major part of the problem in this sector,” said MAIL spokesman Akbar Rustami.

Officials have said the lack of security, climate change and the flood of return refugees in the past three years has resulted in the increase in poverty and lack of food security.

Tom Daley took the opportunity at this year's Commonwealth games to call out the 37 countries of the Commonwealth that still outlaw homosexuality. Daley is pictured above at the London 2012 Olympic & Paralympic Games Victory Parade, 10th September. Photo: Jim Thurston (CC.20)

‘I hope one day every athlete from every nation in the Commonwealth will be free to compete openly as who they are too!’ So said British diver Tom Daley last week, celebrating his gold medal win at the XXI Commonwealth Games. The openly gay athlete, a familiar figure in the British LGBT+ community, took the opportunity to call out 37 countries of the Commonwealth that still outlaw homosexuality.

Daley's intention is admirable. Too frequently these international competitions gloss over the exploitative and exclusionary practices of their participants. Yet the comments portray gaps in how we understand the struggle for global LGBT+ rights. The widely applauded statement came with no recognition of one powerful fact: nearly all of the Commonwealth countries that outlaw homosexuality do so through colonial-era British laws. The hostility towards LGBT+ people across the Commonwealth is a legacy of Britain’s empire.

Victorian imperial policy was preoccupied with a desire for social control, and there are few areas where the policy was as hardline as on same-sex relations. As the British grip on the colonies tightened, anti-sodomy laws proliferated. Instead of the convoluted and antiquated structure of British law, imperial policy strove for simplified codes, which could be applied in more or less undifferentiated fashion to different colonies.

The Indian Penal Code and the Queensland Penal Code were two such examples. Their provisions against ‘unnatural offences’ were fast exported across the Empire, from Kenya to Fiji. There is a marked difference between codifying pre-existing homophobia and suppressing local sexual practices that included homosexuality – but British colonial policy consisted of the latter as well as the former. The laws expressed a very British contempt for perceived vice and immorality in the colonies.

Just last month, a Kenyan Court of Appeal found that conducting forced anal exams on those suspected of same-sex relations was unconstitutional. These exams were deployed in defence of Section 162 of the Kenyan Penal Code. This condemns, in words unchanged from the British era, ‘carnal knowledge against the order of nature’. These medical intrusions are a legacy of one of Britain’s most shameful exports. The greater picture is that over half of the countries that criminalize same-sex relations today were once British colonies.

Advert

This is not to exonerate politicians across the Commonwealth. Many African leaders, for example, have honed a specific form of homophobia which dictates sodomy as un-African and LGBT+ human rights as a form of Western cultural imperialism. As recently as 2014, Nigeria signed in a new law outlawing same-sex relationships with a 14-year prison sentence. Yet the role of Britain in planting and entrenching these ills is undeniable. The British LGBT+ community must not just speak out of fellow-feeling across borders, compelling as such solidarity is. We must speak boldly against the imperial legacy from which Britain continues to profit, while LGBT+ people in the Commonwealth suffer.

As the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting takes place in London this week, a 100,000-strong petition is demanding the inclusion of LGBT+ rights on the agenda. Last year, Theresa May recognized the colonial legacy of homophobia and promised to discuss LGBT+ issues at this meeting. It is doubtful how effective the unbinding, vague structures of the Commonwealth might ever be in liberating the marginalized. In any case, reports are now circulating that the government is reneging on May’s previous approach in favour of a friendly post-Brexit pitch for trade with Commonwealth nations. It seems ‘Empire 2.0’ will borrow much from the homophobia of the first version.

We must demand better: a vocal and global apology for anti-sodomy laws from the British government, as part of a long-overdue strategy for dealing with the recalcitrant abuses of Empire, would be a good place to start. This apology must clarify on the world stage that homophobia, not homosexuality, is the true Western export.

Indeed, we need more than an apology. Britain needs to stop harming the international victims of queerphobia through its draconian immigration law. There are countless stories of LGBT+ people who come to Britain for sanctuary from persecution, only to be turned away by a callous Home Office. We must stand with the Stansted 15, who chained themselves to a secretive charter flight to stop Home Office deportations. One deportee onboard was a lesbian woman being threatened by an ex-husband in Nigeria. The 15 activists are now being tried under anti-terror law.

Such work will require dislodging Britain’s self-image as a guarantor of LGBT+ rights. It is easy to forget amid Britain’s triumphalist rhetoric that the first country to constitutionally prohibit discrimination based on ‘sexual orientation’ was post-apartheid South Africa, where leaders and activists built commonalities between the experiences of homophobia and racism. This should be a reminder to all that LGBT+ activism is not a preserve of the West. It is also a case for hope.

That hope endures. This week, gay Trinidadian activist Jason Jones won his case to decriminalize homosexuality in Trinidad & Tobago, bringing that fated number of Commonwealth from 37 to 36. Jones relocated to London in the 1980s for refuge before building a brave case for freedom – but would he have been able to do so today, with the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policies that involve deporting Commonwealth citizens? We will all watch with admiration as activists across the Commonwealth rise up against homophobic laws. We must also remind ourselves what our government did, and still does, to harm them.

The first inkling was a message to the Shoreditch Sisters WI Facebook page from a press agency, asking about a blog written by another WI member in Hastings. The writer had recently attended an event at the Royal Albert Hall celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage, at which our treasurer, Lottie Gough, had spoken about the future of the institute. Writing pseudonymously as “Hastings Battleaxe” she accused us of considering her generation dinosaurs. Voila, the press had “a war within the WI”.

We were saddened that the coverage was for a negative reason. We love the WI

At our usual weekly committee meeting, the agenda, which included booking speakers to teach us how to make pickles, was put to one side. That day articles had appeared in the Daily Mail, The Times and The Telegraph, for which neither our branch nor the woman from Hastings had commented.

We were saddened that the coverage was for such a negative reason. We love the WI, and as volunteers we wouldn’t continue committing our time if we didn’t. It has been a place to make friends, especially important for potentially isolated young women who have moved to a city for work or study. We hope to offer a place for all types of women to be themselves, young and old and from any background. Age, political views, religion, work or marital status doesn’t matter. We extend that friendship to all members of all WIs, including those in Hastings.

We certainly don’t, as the blog accuses, consider anyone an old bat. She wrote that we are “held up to the rest of us presumably uncool un-regenerated ‘unwoke’ old bats [and] battleaxes as the role-model future of the movement”

She goes on to say that if you look. at what we do it is no different from the activities of any other WI group. In this she is correct. We bake cakes, have a monthly knitting night and have just as much fun socialising and making friends as every other WI in the country – except we’ve done it with more press coverage.

When we began, in 2007, our founding president was Jazz Domino Holly, now an author of craft books. She is also the daughter of the Clash frontman Joe Strummer, and so we were dubbed the coolest WI in the country. Stories about us as a younger WI appeared, contradicting the stereotype of elderly village ladies. We decided to put the attention to good use by campaigning with a project designed to attract press attention to the practice of female genital mutilation affecting women in the UK. We made a quilt of individually stitched vulvas, including those made by members in other branches. This was eye-catching enough to interest the local, then national press. A few years later, we started campaigning about refugee detention at Yarlswood with Women For Refugee Women, and are currently working on a new campaign about period poverty.

The Jam and Jerusalem media image of the Women’s Institute has always been a little off, and the Shoreditch Sisters WI are no different from the organisation as a whole. Our campaigning is exactly what the WI has always done. The women who came before us passed some radical mandates for campaigning. In the 1940s, there was a mandate to demand equal pay for women. In 1960 we were discussing the impact of pesticides, in 1971 it was plastic packaging. A later resolution in 2005 saw WI members return excess packaging to supermarkets to encourage retailers to reduce waste. In 1975 we were discussing refuges for survivors of domestic violence and their children, asking for sufficient provision in every county. In 1986 we asked for the government to inform the general public of the true facts concerning Aids. The Terrence Higgins Trust has said the WI “does not flinch from the more difficult issues that face society”.

After the media attention this week, we have received messages of support from WI members all over the country, with some saying our branch inspired them to start their own WI. Many new branches have opened in the last ten years, such as The Dalston Darlings, Buns and Roses and the Gnosall Jambusters and they all accept members of all ages. All WIs are different. With more than 6,300 branches totalling more than 220,000 members, each one is semi-autonomous, deciding its own programme of events.

As far as we are concerned, there is no divide within the WI. We’d love the Hastings blogger to come to one of our meetings and meet us. She wrote that the “life experience and knowledge of the older members” needs to be combined with the “enthusiasm and energy of the new”. We couldn’t agree more.","The Women’s Institute that I help run has received a sudden amount of media interest this week.
We love the WI, and as volunteers we wouldn’t continue committing our time if we didn’t.
We hope to offer a place for all types of women to be themselves, young and old and from any background.

65,https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2018/04/10/life-without-parole-no-moral-alternative-death-penalty,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",America Magazine,Life without parole is no moral alternative to the death penalty,"On Feb. 23, for the first time since 2010, three Americans were scheduled for execution on the same day. Ultimately, one man received a last-minute death row commutation, and the botched, painful execution of another was halted and postponed. This drew the spectacle of the death penalty back into the spotlight, but the United States has moved away from the punishment, with just 39 people sentenced to death in 2017, down from 315 in 1996. Another sentence has silently taken its place: life imprisonment without parole.

Often regarded as a humane alternative to the death penalty, sentences of life without parole (also known as LWOP) have essentially the same result: slow aging behind bars and death in prison. The Sentencing Project reported in 2017 that about 53,000 Americans are serving this hopeless sentence which Pope Francis has called “a death penalty in disguise”—a number that has quadrupled since 1992.

Giving an imprisoned person the possibility of parole does not guarantee eventual freedom, but it does offer a glimmer of hope for redemption. Denying this hope is considered inhuman and degrading treatment by the European Court of Human Rights.

About 53,000 Americans are serving this hopeless sentence that Pope Francis has called “a death penalty in disguise.”

In the United States, LWOP sentencing is biased and arbitrary. About 56 percent of those with the sentence are black, an even greater overrepresentation than the number of black prisoners on death row. And are people inherently more dangerous in California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the five states responsible for 58 percent of life without parole sentences?

A study based on past exonerations, published by the National Academy of Sciences, estimates that 4 percent of people on death row were wrongfully convicted. If that percentage holds for those with LWOP sentences, 2,000 people are dying in prison for crimes they did not commit. Innocent people serving life without parole are unlikely to have their convictions overturned, as they lack the state-funded legal support and unlimited appeals offered to those on death row.

When we permanently remove 53,000 people from society, countless others are left behind. Children, spouses, parents and loved ones face lifelong stress, trauma and financial strain as they work to maintain relationships that will never be the same again. People serving L.W.O.P sentences miss their children’s weddings and their parents’ funerals, and children grow up knowing they will never see their parent outside a prison visiting room.

Until recently, even children were routinely locked up for life. But in 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that only “the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption” may receive the sentence. The U.S. Catholic bishops have called for an absolute ban on life sentences without parole for juveniles.

Banning the sentence for children is not enough. Americans and lawmakers across the political spectrum support reducing our prison populations by shortening sentences for nonviolent offenses. But just over half the people in state prisons are there for violent crimes. Rethinking their sentences is more difficult, but it is just as necessary for reform.

Public safety is important to consider, but so is the generational pain and damage caused by incarceration.

Incarceration serves four purposes: deterrence, incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation. Life without parole is not necessary to serve any of these.

First, while potential criminals may be deterred by the threat of prison, studies show that extreme sentences like life without parole do little to prevent additional crime.

Prison sentences do incapacitate by physically removing potentially dangerous people from the community, but in this realm, too, life without parole is usually excessive. Research shows that even those who commit violent crimes mature out of lawbreaking by middle age, yet we bury people in prisons as they grow old, sick and frail. Public safety is important to consider, but so is the generational pain and damage caused by incarceration. In the words of Pope Francis, “To cage people…for the mere fact that if he is inside we are safe, this serves nothing. It does not help us.”

As for retribution, that is a complicated factor. Violent crimes tear lives apart, and the desire for punishment is understandable. The pain of victims should never be dismissed or overlooked, and our criminal justice system should allow more opportunities for healing as a community. But as Catholics, we are called to show mercy.

That leaves rehabilitation. The U.S. Catholic bishops wrote in 2000 that “Abandoning the parole system, as some states have done…turns prisons into warehouses where inmates grow old, without hope, their lives wasted.” And as Pope Francis said before the U.S. Congress in 2015, “A just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.”

For those opposed to the death penalty, a sentence of any length may sound like a better alternative. But locking people away and throwing away the key is not a moral solution.","Often regarded as a humane alternative to the death penalty, sentences of life without parole (also known as LWOP) have essentially the same result: slow aging behind bars and death in prison.
And are people inherently more dangerous in California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the five states responsible for 58 percent of life without parole sentences?

Five years on, Nils Adler finds foreign companies have yet to deliver on promises to local farmers

Outside Lichinga in northern Mozambique, a group of young men lie across the road warming themselves on the sun-soaked asphalt. To one side stand hundreds of acres of pine forests owned by Norwegian company Green Resources, the legacy of a programme that had promised to bring wealth and employment to the most impoverished region in the country. On the other side stand maize fields that surround the homes of local small-scale farmers who, like the majority of Mozambicans, still rely on subsistence farming for survival.

The plantations were the initiative of the Swedish government-funded Malonda programme. One of the first foreign-investment initiatives in the Niassa region, it ushered in a large-scale pine and eucalyptus forestry project managed by the Chikweti company (a subsidiary of the Swedish investment firm GSFF).

‘The contracts just ended… We were 80 people, now we are 4’

Malonda promised a win-win situation with job creation and community-based development, as well as a healthy return on investment for GSFF’s shareholders (which included the Lutheran churches of both Norway and Sweden as well as Dutch Pension Fund ABP).

Chikweti began planting trees in 2007; it quickly became embroiled in disputes with small-scale farmers; according to a study by the Mozambican Ministry of Agriculture and the National Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry (DNTF), the company had illegally occupied 32,000 hectares (320 square kilometres) in the Niassa region.

‘At first people resisted [Chikweti’s plantations], and there were many quarrels,’ recalls Nconda, the traditional leader – or régulo in Portuguese – of a village, whose name he shares. At 69 years old, Nconda looks to be in good health as he sits with his daughter-in-law, Delinda, ripping kernels of maize – the primary form of sustenance in the region – from shanks in his front yard. A key figure in approving the land lease, he remembers how anger boiled over when Chikweti took land that had not been ceded to the company, in the middle of local farmers’ planting season. In April 2011, peasants from the Licole and Lipende villages uprooted and cut down 60,000 pine trees and destroyed some equipment.

Advert

The initial anger subsided ‘when [Chikweti] began clearing the land and planting – there were more jobs for the community and their image began to change for the better.’

Nconda encouraged his daughter-in-law to work at the plantations that now border his village. ‘But after the first labour-intensive months, the work dried up and tensions began to rise again. The employment was needed just for certain seasons. People began to get frustrated by just sitting at home and waiting for more work, so they made fires [arson] in the plantations.’

Idle lands

Soon, scandal hit. In June 2013, an audit of the Malonda Foundation showed striking irregularities. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) found that $32,000 in counterfeit cheques had been embezzled at the Niassa office, and immediately withdrew its investment. But half of the total $9 million pledged between 2010 and 2013 had already been paid out. In 2014, Green Resources – who claim to be Africa’s largest forestry company – acquired GSFF and absorbed Chikweti into their portfolio, which already includes plantations in Tanzania and Uganda.

Four years since the change in ownership, anger over Chikweti’s actions has given way to frustration at Green Resources’ absence.

What Mussa wants to know is simple: ‘Just tell us what is happening!’ He squats on a small wooden stool outside his home in Mapudje village, briefly unwrapping his one-year-old son, who has malaria, from a thick cloth to observe his pallor. Behind them, the morning sun highlights the wide regimented rows of pine trees that cover the undulating hills; the plantations stretching far into the horizon until they meet a single, unforgiving inselberg.

Like so many of his fellow farmers, Muusa bought into Chikweti’s rhetoric and ambitious employment schemes. He feels frustrated that he was persuaded to give up his land for work on the plantation, only to see his employers vanish. He has been waiting years for an explanation from a forestry company representative.

‘The contracts just ended,’ says Maskuini, a régulo of Liconhile village, who says the temporary nature of the jobs for which he traded his land were not made clear. ‘We were 80 people [who worked on the plantations], now we are 4.’

After Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975, a bitter civil war ensued, lasting 15 years. In 1997, to balance the interests of foreign investors and the local communities, a system of leasing rules called ‘DUATs’ was introduced that barred investors from buying land but allowed them to rent it from the government for up to 50 years.

The elders of Liconhile believe that forestry companies deliberately misinformed villagers in order to obtain their consent for the DUATs. This claim is echoed in a report by the National Peasants Union of Mozambique (UNAC) that describes community consultations ‘as part of the grooming strategy for communities to give up their land’.

Shutting out the light

As the conifers grow, a new problem arises. Kauguanha, a village leader who farms maize fields that border the plantations, says many people have seen their yields decrease as the pine trees block out ever more sunlight. ‘The shadow can affect one or two hectares of land; sometimes the only area a family has to grow crops on,’ he says.

These impacts exacerbate food insecurity in a region where 43 per cent of children aged 0-5 years suffer from chronic under-nutrition. According to a UNAC report published in August 2016, the plantations have also depleted water resources and affected the local flora and fauna in the area.

The National Peasants Union of Mozambique describes community consultations ‘as part of the grooming strategy for communities to give up their land’

Green Resources have a chequered record elsewhere in Africa: a 2015 investigation by the Swedish TV channel, TV4, exposed how the firm had forced people off their farms to make way for the Kachung plantation in Uganda.

But the company are promising transparency, better communication – and even jobs in the near future. They say they are planning to harvest and re-plant in northern Mozambique during 2018; work which will require seasonal workers from the local community.

‘As our trees are beginning to mature, and business moves forwards, we expect to be in a position to offer such work annually,’ says Emma Shepheard-Walwyn, the Acting Environmental and Social Governance Director at Green Resources.

‘At this stage, we cannot give firm numbers on how many workers we will need. We inform the community leaders if we are seeking seasonal or permanent staff, and individuals are given all the relevant information when signing their contracts with the company.’

The firm is also paying into two ‘social funds’ aimed at compensating local communities for lost land. One provides $5 per hectare per year for land that has been planted but is reduced to $2 if vandalized; the second provides communities with $1 per hectare, less than the price of a local cup of coffee.

When Green Resources do begin to recruit in the Niassa region, there will be no lack of demand.

‘For us there are two options: farming here or working for a company like Green Resources,’ explains Alberto, an 18-year-old from the area of Chimbonila. ‘We do not read or write and we can’t get a job in Lichinga [the regional capital].’

In the absence of competition, permanent employees can expect to receive $60 per month: Mozambique’s base level of minimum wage for the sector.

This year’s harvest may provide a willing workforce, but it will also force Green Resources to answer some uncomfortable questions from local communities. Eleven years since the forestry companies planted the first tree in this remote corner of Mozambique, they will find people much more savvy when it comes to exploitation and misinformation.

67,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/opinion/without-winnie-there-would-be-no-nelson-mandela_130064,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Jamaica Observer,"Without Winnie, there would be no Nelson Mandela","Winnie Mandela, second wife of Nelson Mandela, died last week on April 2, 2018, at the age of 81 and just four months before the 100th anniversary of his birth. Because of the difficulties she endured earlier in her life, it should come as no surprise that she had been ailing for some time. When she entered hospital this last time, however, she was complaining of the flu.

Born Nomzamo Winifred Zanyive Madikizela on September 26, 1936, the daughter of teachers, she still knew poverty, as her father poured all his earnings into a futile attempt to get her ailing mother well. Winnie graduated as head girl at her school and received training as a social worker.

One afternoon, in her 22nd year, she was at the bus stop when she caught the eye of a civil rights lawyer 20 years her senior. His name was Nelson Mandela. They had dinner the following week and married the following year. Marital bliss was short-lived, as five years later he received a life sentence for 'subversive activities'. Twenty-seven-year-old Winnie was left to be a single mother for their two young daughters.

This was when the persona of the Winnie the world came to know and which started to take shape. No shrinking violet, she made it crystal clear that she would be a force to reckon with. She was beaten, harassed, imprisoned, and tortured. Quotes by her over the years reveal her mindset and her resolve:

“I had so little time to love him. And that love has survived all these years of separation...perhaps if I'd had time to know him better I might have found a lot of faults, but I only had time to love him and long for him all the time.”

“They think because they have put my husband on an island that he will be forgotten. They are wrong. the harder they try to silence him, the louder I will become.”

“It is only when all black groups join hands and speak with one voice that we shall be a bargaining force which will decide its own destiny.

“If you are to free yourselves you must break the chains of oppression yourself. Only then can we express our dignity. Only when we have liberated ourselves can we cooperate with other groups. Any acceptance of humiliation, indignity and insult is acceptance of inferiority.”

“The overwhelming majority of women accept patriarchy unquestioningly and even protect it, working out the resultant frustrations not against men but against themselves in their competition for men as sons, lovers and husbands.

“Traditionally, the violated wife bides her time and off-loads her built in aggression on her daughter-in-law. So men dominate women through the agency of women themselves.”

“With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we will liberate this country.”

“The years of imprisonment hardened me...Perhaps if you have been given a moment to hold back and wait for the next blow, your emotions would be blunted as they have been in my case.

“When it happens every day of your life, when that pain becomes a way of life, I no longer have the emotion of fear. There is no longer anything I can fear. There is nothing the government has not done to me. There isn't any pain I have not known.”

History has a way of relegating women to the 'also ran' position. Paul Revere is revered because, during the American Revolution, he rode 20 miles on the night of April 18 to warn American troops that the British were near. The name Sybil Ludington is not known by most. But it was 16-year-old Sybil, on her dad's instructions, who jumped on her horse, Star, and rode from nine o'clock that night for 40 miles until dawn, delivering the same message.

Rosalind Franklin would never win a prize for the best dressed woman. But she had a fantastic brain. She used it to make groundbreaking contributions in several areas. In one such case, she used her X-ray crystallography skills to capture a clear and concise picture leading to discovery of DNA's double helix structure. This earned the Nobel Prize in 1958. But only the men involved in the project were named. Susan Kare was the graphic designer who worked alongside Steve Jobs to make the Mac one of the most user-friendly computers in the world. Susan who?

When Apartheid ended, Winnie served briefly in government positions. But the preceding 40 years had turned her into a street fighter. She held radical views for the rest of her life. But should we be surprised? Could a system that sees a group of people as less than human, and treats them as such be asked, politely, to just start treating them as equals?

For those of her detractors sipping tea on their back patios, I would urge them to read Marcus Garvey's Philosophy and Opinions, written in 1923 when Nelson Mandela was just five years old. I would limit them to two short quotes which, decades before Apartheid ended, summed up Winnie's philosophy, opinions, strategies and procedures:

1. Radicalism is a label that is always applied to people who are endeavouring to get freedom.

2. Hungry men have no respect for law, authority or human life.

It is people in these conditions who called her Mother of the Nation.

For the 27 years of Mandela's imprisonment it was Winnie who brought information about a changing world to him. It was she who went back to the people with words of encouragement from him. His memories of prison were pleasant, much different from Winnie's nightmarish experiences which tested her mental capacities greatly. He was able to feel safe; protected. He was respected. He had time to become tolerant and forgiving because he was not in solitary confinement.

Winnie was beautiful on the outside, but this hid the bruises from beatings, and the corns and calluses of a successful struggle to change an unjust system. It was this tortured, hurting soul that held her head up, stepped proudly into Victor Perstor Prison, held Nelson Mandela's hand and sent him into history.

Without Winnie, there would be no Nelson. She must not be forgotten.

RANGPUR, Bangladesh, Apr 9 2018 (IPS) - Most migrants to Europe, Australia and the United States from Rangpur in northern Bangladesh leave home at a young age and return when they have just passed middle age.



Intensely connected and immersed in family bonds and Bangladeshi cultural values, they tend to return to their birthplace despite obtaining citizenship from a second country. For them, going to these far flung places is about working hard to save money. And in the end, they want to come back home.

Many are now well off and have enough funds to invest in business ventures in Rangpur and in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. This IPS correspondent recently met two such returnees – Rakibuzzaman and Golam Sarwar Habib.

Both had migrated to Belgium in their youth and have now returned to Bangladesh in their middle age. Both of them enjoy dual citizenship of Bangladesh and Belgium.

The stories of Rakibuzzaman and Habib tell us that wherever migrants go, they are looking for better incomes mainly to look after their families back home. Many return with newly acquired skills and invest in the economies of their home countries. Their contributions to host and home countries are immense and help economies on both sides.

Rakibuzzaman, 54, of Senpara area in Rangpur city, 300 km north of the capital, now runs a large restaurant and a readymade garments shop in Dhap area of the city. Rakibuzzaman spoke to IPS about how he passed his days in anguish and agony in Belgium without his parents and relatives who he left behind in Bangladesh for more than twenty years.

The third of six siblings, Rakib was brought up in an extended family. His father was an inspector in the Bangladesh police force. He completed a Secondary School Certificate (equivalent to O levels) from Rangpur Zila School in 1982. From early childhood, he dreamt about going to a European country with a view to earning money.

“To go to a European country was not as difficult in the 1990s as it is nowadays,” Rakib told IPS.

He left Bangladesh for Germany in 1986 with a visit visa and stayed there for one year. Then in 1987, he moved to Belgium and worked at a chemical factory in Ghent, a port city in the northwest, for almost four years.

“I found business to be more profitable than the job in Ghent and therefore opened up a shop in the city and ran the business profitably for about 17 years,” said Rakib.

“There was hardly a day in Belgium that passed without recalling my sweet memories in Bangladesh,” he said, adding, “We had no telephone connection with my home in Bangladesh and communication with my relatives in Bangladesh from Belgium was very expensive. I could talk to my mother over the phone only once a week.”

Rakib’s mother eagerly waited for him to call at the house of a neighbor every weekend.

“I felt the absence of my parents and relatives badly during my stay in Belgium,” Rakib said, adding that he was always anxious to get some news on Bangladesh every day but Bangladeshi newspapers were not available in Belgium.

The Belgian government confirmed his citizenship after four years of living there. After getting his passport, he traveled to Bangladesh to meet his parents and relatives.

“I can’t explain how I felt on the day I arrived in Bangladesh from Belgium in 1996. On arrival at Saidpur airport, I wished I could kiss its soil,” said Rakib.

“I spent one month with my family and having me at home, my family’s joy was endless. It was a festive period for one month. As soon as I left Bangladesh for Belgium, my parents and family members fell back into deep pathos. Departure from Bangladesh for me was painful too. Despite the pain I never lost sight of what I had as a life in Belgium.”

Rakib could not bury his mother nor his father after their deaths within a span of ten years. In both cases, he arrived at his home in Rangpur city a week following their deaths. And in Bangladesh, like in many countries, those of Islamic faith must bury the departed within 24 hours. It is his greatest sadness in life that he could not be there to bury his parents and Rakib says he still haunted by guilt.

“My elder sister who was a lawyer in Rangpur court also died during my stay in Belgium,” he said. “I could not attend her funeral in the country because I was heavily engaged in the business in Ghent in those days.”

In 1998, he married Momotaz Zaman of Rangpur and managed to organize her travel to Belgium after three months. They now have two children, Sayeduzzaman Rayan and Raina. Though the children are citizens of Belgium, they have been brought up in Bangladesh.

“My son Rayan completed A-level with grade A in three subjects from North-West International School (English medium of instruction) under British Council in Rangpur this year and daughter, Raina is doing her O levels from the same institution,” Rakib said.

Rayan is now looking for a university in Europe for graduate school.

Rakib said Belgium is one of the best countries in Europe, adding, “Although being citizens of Belgium, Rayan and Raina should not forget the culture and values of Bangladesh.”

“My wish is that they should come back to Bangladesh after getting higher education from abroad. Because Bangladesh has progressed economically. If the government keeps the national growth at the same rate, the country will be upgraded to a rich country in the next 20 years. What we need now is good policies and good governance from the government side,” Rakib concludes.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), about 500,000 people migrate from Bangladesh to work abroad each year. Migrant workers collectively contribute about 7 to 8 percent to the country’s total GDP in the form of remittances, a significant contribution to the nation’s growth and development.

An IOM study in 2016 found that on average, only 31 percent of those who leave the country obtain employment in skilled occupations. Most migrants lack training and very few have qualifications recognized by host nations.

IOM says Bangladesh’s National Skills Development Policy 2011 addressed many of the problems faced by migrant workers by encouraging training institutes to be labour market responsive, assure quality training, provide standardized assessments and certification and to adopt a National Technical and Vocational Qualifications Framework with clear levels which translate into recognized qualifications in foreign countries.

Golam Sarwar Habib, 56, of Khalipara in Rangpur left Bangladesh in 1991 after graduating from university when he was 27. He went to Belgium directly.

“In the early years, for almost five years I used to do odd jobs,” he said. “Later, I set up a shop at Ghent.”

At 35, Habib married a Belgian woman and became a citizen of Belgium by dint of marriage. Habib chose not to disclose his wife and son’s names to IPS.

“My wife and two sons often visit Bangladesh but do not stay here for more than two weeks at a stretch,” he said.

Habib purchased a shopping mall named Jahaj Company Complex in 2007 in the middle of Rangpur City. There are 120 small shops in the three-storey mall. He leased the shops to some businessmen of Rangpur. In return, he gets a handsome amount of rental money.

Habib said, “The shopping mall is not a profitable concern compared with the investment. But I can be busy with the work here when I come to Bangladesh.”

Habib spends six months in Bangladesh each year and six months in Belgium. He still runs his business in Ghent.

“The information technology has advanced so far that I can oversee my business in Belgium even from Bangladesh,” he said.

Like Rakib, Habib says the well-being of his parents and relatives is very important. He said he is deeply saddened when he learns of deaths of his near and dear ones while he is not living in Bangladesh.","For Many Migrants, No Land Is Sweeter Than HomeRANGPUR, Bangladesh, Apr 9 2018 (IPS) - Most migrants to Europe, Australia and the United States from Rangpur in northern Bangladesh leave home at a young age and return when they have just passed middle age.

Oscar-winning Natalie Portman denied all accusation of endorsing a boycott of Israel, which followed her decision to pass on a Genesis Prize ceremony, dubbed the “Jewish Nobel Prize.”

According to Portman, who posted a statement on Instagram, her decision has been mischaracterized. She chose to pull out of the ceremony, as she didn’t want to endorse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony.

Portman’s refusal earlier caused harsh reactions on social media and among Israeli officials, as the initial statement from her publicist read that she wouldn’t attend the ceremony due to her “distress over recent events.” Although it didn’t specify what exactly made Portman change her mind and skip the ceremony she earlier agreed to, the timing was suggestive. Her decision followed the latest violent clashes on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli defense forces opened fire on Palestinian protesters, killing several. The move was condemned by the UN and the EU as disproportionally violent.

The Hollywood star was blamed for sympathizing with BDS (the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) supporters. It went as far as demands from a Knesset member to strip the Israeli citizenship from the Hollywood star, who was born in Israel with the name Hershlag.

Where Money Goes

The Genesis Prize Foundation also decided to cancel the ceremony, stating that the organizers “fear that Ms. Portman’s decision will cause our philanthropic initiative to be politicized, something we have worked hard for the past five years to avoid.”

The Genesis Prize is to “honor individuals who serve as an inspiration to the next generation of Jews through their outstanding professional achievement along with their commitment to Jewish values and the Jewish people.” It was established by Russian businessmen with Jewish roots, including the banker Mikhail Friedman. The list of recipients of the $1 million prize includes artist Anish Kapoor, violinist Itzhak Perlman, former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg and Hollywood star Michael Douglas.

Those who get the prize usually choose to donate it to a charity of their choice. But Portman won’t get an opportunity to direct her reward, which was doubled specifically for her this year. Due to the recent event, the foundation is to choose where the money goes. However, in her recent statement Portman claimed that she is going to support a number of charities in Israel.

Long Story of Uneasiness

It’s not the first time the actress has publically opposed the current Israeli prime minister. After Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected 2015, she lambasted the politician in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, saying she was “very, very upset and disappointed.”

“I find his racist comments horrific. However, I don’t — what I want to make sure is, I don’t want to use my platform [the wrong way]. I feel like there are some people who become prominent, and then it’s out in the foreign press. You know, shit on Israel. I do not. I don’t want to do that,” she told the media outlet then.","The Hollywood star, known for her active commitment to her Jewish heritage, reveals why she had refused to go to Israel to fetch a $2 million prize.

U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said millions of civilians were still caught up in the seven-year-old conflict and many who escaped battle zones had to seek shelter in overcrowded camps for the displaced in Idlib in the northwest.

Insurgent officials say they fear an offensive against Idlib by Syria’s military and its allies Russia and Iran, something humanitarian agencies say could produce civilian suffering on a greater scale than during the siege of Aleppo last year.

“We cannot have a war in Idlib. I keep saying that now to Russia, to Iran, to Turkey, to the United States, to anyone that can have an influence,” Egeland told reporters.

He called for negotiations to protect the civilians, and said recent air raids in Idlib were a bad omen.

The war has been going President Bashar Assad’s way since Russia intervened on his side in 2015. From holding less than a fifth of Syria in 2015, Assad has recovered to control the largest chunk of the country with Russian and Iranian help.

The Idlib region remains the largest populated area of Syria in the hands of insurgents fighting the Damascus government. Syrians have poured into Idlib at an accelerating rate over the last two years from areas recaptured by the army.

Egeland said about 11,000 Syrians are still under siege and 2 million are hard to reach with humanitarian aid, compared to 625,000 under siege and 4.6 million who were hard to reach a year ago.

“The notion that it is ebbing, this war, is completely wrong. This war is on and it’s still in the midst of the civilian population,” Egeland told reporters.

Egeland added there were reports of deals to evacuate people from some of the remaining sieges including from the former Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk south of Damascus.

Those evacuees were likely to go to Idlib, Egeland said, under what he said were deals done without U.N. or other humanitarian involvement. Under such agreements between rebels and the government, insurgents facing military defeat are permitted to withdraw to opposition-held areas.

It would have been better to protect them where they were, since Idlib was already “full to the brim” with displaced civilians living in the open and in congested camps, or crammed into collective centers, he said.

“They arrive at 2 a.m. every night now, just to find they can hardly get a bed,” he said.

Not all siege survivors go to Idlib. In eastern Ghouta, 40,000 were still in camps, with reports that men aged 16-65 were barred from leaving, Egeland said, adding U.N. aid access was severely restricted.

A rare positive development was a system of “deconfliction” — providing the warring parties with information about the locations of hospitals and other humanitarian sites. This year 500 sites had been added to 160 already in the system.

But there had been four air raids on deconflicted sites this year. Russia had given the U.N. reports on air strikes on two hospitals in March, Egeland said, adding that he also wanted reports on strikes on hospitals in northern Homs last week.

“If there is no accountability, the system doesn’t work. I’m refusing to give up,” he said.","“We cannot have a war in Idlib.

Residents there say life is getting worse day in, day out. Jammeh, a Muslim of the Jola ethnic group, had supplied water and electricity to minority Jola free of charge. ""We are not happy at all since our president left. We're not happy because there's no electricity anymore,"" resident Oumie Ceesay told DW.

In Foni district of the West Coast region, Jammeh also had a modern market built, ensuring that women like Ceesay could preserve and sell their foodstuffs.

According to Demba Ali Jawo, the minister of information and communication infrastructure, residents have access to water and electricity, but they have to pay for it, and that's precisely what they're protesting. ""President Jammeh gave an unfair advantage to some parts of the country, which was not fair to the rest of the population,"" Jawo told DW. He explained that ""one particular village was getting all these facilities for free at the expense of the state, and other parts of the country were not electrified at all."" The new government says it's trying to redistribute the country's resources in more equitable manner.

Tough task of reconciling Gambians

Supporters of Yahya Jammeh say they would like to have him back as a leader

In December 2016, former President Jammeh lost the election to a businessman, Adama Barrow, but he subsequently refused to step down. Then the political drama ended with an armed intervention threat by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to remove Jammeh by force. He finally relented and left the country, taking with him a fleet of luxury cars and cash.

More than a year after Jammeh was persuaded to leave, his image still adorns the T-shirts and printed cloth worn by supporters of his party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), which has struggled to find a replacement for the strongman who said he would rule for ""a billion years if Allah wished it.""

Incredible support for Jammeh is nowhere more alive than in Foni Kansala, where the division Jammeh sowed between his ethnic group, the Jola, and the majority Mandinka has often broken out into violence. But some prominent voices still advocate Jammeh's legacy. Musa Amul Nyassi, 49, is a member of the Gambian parliament and a former minister of land in Jammeh's government.

The parliamentarian has one thing in common with the residents in Bwian. He's a solid supporter of the former president and a strong pillar of the APRC. For many Gambians in this region, including MP Nyassi, Jammeh is the father of the nation, who should be returned in dignity. ""He has brought unprecedented development in the country that no Gambian ever thought,"" Nyassi told DW. ""We feel that with all he has done for his country, whatever it is, he should also be given the right to come back and stay in the country like any other ordinary citizen,"" Nyassi added.

Sheltering rebels

Equatorial Guinea's longtime President Obiang Nguema welcomed him. To the best of public knowledge, Jammeh has remained there ever since. But from afar he still rules the hearts of many in the Foni region, presenting a stumbling block for the current government in rebuilding a united people.

The new Gambian government has accused Jammeh's supporters of welcoming foreign rebels into their homes in an attempt to destabilize the West African nation. Recently, Barrow and his cabinet members visited Jammeh's stronghold to try and win over the former leader's supporters. ""We are very optimistic that as time goes on the people will come to realize that President Jammeh has gone and he's never likely to come back to this country as a leader,"" Minister Ali Jawo said.

One thing is for sure, The Gambia has a new leadership and most citizens are free to speak out without fear for their lives. But more than a third of the country's population lives below the UN poverty line of $1 per day. The Gambia's poor are mostly in rural areas, and 60 percent of them rely on agriculture to make a living. Irregular rainfall, economic instability, and fluctuating food pricing all add to the already divided country.","The former president of The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, may have been known as a brutal man, merciless and one of the 21st century's dangerous dictators, but the man is missed dearly in his home district, Foni Kansala.

73,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-margo-jefferson,"Sat, 05 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,No Cinderella: Margo Jefferson on the real Meghan Markle,"In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.

In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”

Rachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.

The family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan’s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.

Meghan’s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older. Relations with them, at least since the courtship and engagement, have been strained.

Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.

Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.

The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.” Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.

The couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

The couple's first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, is born in London. They announce that they are to step back from life as 'senior' royals, triggering a row with Buckingham Palace. After a crisis meeting with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William at Sandringham, the Queen issues a statement saying the couple will have a 'transition period' before ending their royal duties. It is announced that Harry and Meghan will drop their HRH titles and repay £2.4m of taxpayers money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage.

Markle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois. Besides becoming an actor, she became a feminist who worked for UN Women as an advocate for political participation and leadership. Yes, she has been praised and criticised as “outspoken”, but her style never risks being “aggressive” or “combative”, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely – sometimes cloyingly – balances the forthright and the pleasing. She’s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: “It’s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.” With the word “fairytale” now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.

The Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or – like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan – from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor’s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.

Any 'commoner' who marries into any royal family ​is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out

Love that results in the bride’s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any “commoner” who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He’s marrying up by marrying out – out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It’s a world where – as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music – hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.

In this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle’s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: “Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.” And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.

How would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals – unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King’s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.

Perhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.

For this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend’s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party’s theme was “colonial and native”), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother’s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.

Finally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). “I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works,” Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn’t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.

Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy

Whatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.

Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation’s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece’s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.

For Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn’t wait much longer. “Meghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up” went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: “Divorce is hard,” goes its pitch. “Sharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media is next level.”

“Meghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.” The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we’d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause – the afro as proof of the first lady’s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants – probably wasn’t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan’s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it’s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.

But if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of “the mulatto” that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.

She could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt’s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries – she hopes, she longs – to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.

Decades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine’s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there’s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this “touch of the tarbrush” will taint Meghan and Harry’s offspring. Perhaps the “blackamoor” brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.

And surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?” Doria Ragland was cast as “a dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks”. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta’s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.

Early rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it’s reported that Markle’s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.

Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes

In 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.

“You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.” Excellently done, I thought. She’s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.

When it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don’t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she’s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.

The speech she gave at the 2015 UN women’s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist”; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. “It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn’t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn’t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.” May the work recommence once the £32m wedding is done.","In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan).

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group last week said that in the wake of the Royal Commission, which has uncovered wide-spread examples of careless and at times fraudulent lending practices, it would likely be harder for customers to borrow money.

And National Australia Bank said net interest margins on its all-important mortgage book were falling; while Westpac Banking Corp told Reuters it had recently increased scrutiny of borrowers’ living expenses, including asking them to disclose such items as gym memberships and pet insurance, when making loan assessments.

The inquiry has come at a time when there was already a push for increased controls on lending and new capital requirements. Those had helped spark a wave of divestments of cash-intensive wealth management, insurance and financial planning arms.

Borrowers have begun to feel the squeeze, according to Sydney real estate agent Peter Wong, as banks dig through credit histories and ask borrowers for bigger deposits.

“The residential sector has become very, very cautious and so, obviously, they’re making sure that they dot their i’s and cross their t’s, and before it wasn’t like that,” said Wong, who runs an agency in inner-city Chinatown.

“I’ve got property on the market and I’ve had it on for over three months whereas previously, being a popular area, people would buy fairly quickly.”

Australia has an oligopoly banking system - Commonwealth Bank of Australia sits alongside Westpac, NAB and ANZ making up the so-called “Big Four” - which collectively dominate property, investment and business lending, giving Australians limited options when seeking credit.

The banks withstood the financial crisis, and found ways to increase revenues and profits even during times when regulations were ratcheted up, such as a 2012-13 crackdown on investment and insurance product-selling practices.

But the first few months of the Royal Commission inquiry are creating more than just a reputational hazard, with the practices, structures and market dominance of the banks subjected to unprecedented scrutiny.

New regulatory controls are almost certain to be imposed, as examples of fraud and poor lending controls are revealed.

It all means that banks will not only find their ability to make money from lending squeezed, but they also face increased costs - especially as they hire more lawyers and compliance officers to cope with the immediate problems brought up by the Commission and to deal with tougher regulation in the future.

“You don’t have to be Einstein to work out that credit growth slows down, do you?” said Brian Johnson, banks analyst at brokerage CLSA.

ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott told analysts last week that lending conditions had changed. “(The) Royal Commission impact is real, people will still want to buy and own a home...but it will change the process and it probably will make it harder for people to be successful in their applications,” he said.

ANZ did not respond to Reuters’ questions sent on Friday. Westpac referred to the increased scrutiny of borrowers’ expenses, while NAB directed Reuters to previous remarks.

NAB introduced stricter conditions for mortgage borrowers in February and lowered the sums it was prepared to lend, helping push its mortgage margins four basis points lower to 1.34 percent.

CBA directed Reuters to previous statements, which show the bank has been tightening its mortgage lending rules since 2015. It was also ordered last week to hold an extra A$1 billion ($753 million) in capital against its loans after Australia’s banking regulator delivered a scathing report into the bank’s risk-management culture amid allegations it has allowed money laundering to flourish.

“If credit slows down and margins don’t improve, and I don’t really see margins improving here...profits definitely do take a hit,” said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management, which owns bank shares.

HONEY, I SHRUNK THE BANKS

The banks are core to the health of the Australian economy.

Australia’s authorized deposit-taking institutions - a financial subsector the “Big Four” dominate - hold A$4.6 trillion in assets, according to papers filed by the Royal Commission, more than two-and-a-half times the size of Australia’s economy as measured by gross domestic product.

Official lending statistics, which tend to be volatile, show personal and commercial lending has slipped 1.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis since December. Home prices, as measured across the capital cities of the nation’s states and territories, fell 0.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the first negative reading since 2012, according to property consultant CoreLogic.

“You need to be careful there isn’t an over-reaction because a bank can make or break an economy,” said Anne Nalder, head of the Small Business Association of Australia.

She said any obstruction to obtaining credit had an immediate impact on business expenditure and hiring decisions, in an economy, especially as wages growth is modest.

REGULATOR-IMPOSED PANGS

To be sure, Australia’s banks are not in the kind of trouble that led to rescues and emergency injections of cash in Europe and the United States during the financial crisis.

But the increased regulation and scrutiny will be a financial burden and the Australian banks have few defenders given the shocking nature of the revelations.

There have, for example, been disclosures that CBA charged the accounts of customers after they had died, while falsified mortgage documents were used at NAB to help people collect bonuses and beat sales targets. Even Australia’s conservative government – which had resisted for years the calls for a Royal Commission - is now an active critic of their practices.

While borrowers and businesses fret over credit, there is at least one industry benefiting from the banks’ day of judgment.

ANZ estimates it will incur about A$50 million in legal costs linked to the Royal Commission over a 12-month period. CBA has booked a combined A$575 million in charges and provisions in preparation for legal fees, remediation and potential penalties tied to the inquiry and, on another legal front, civil charges linked to a money-laundering case.

There is a huge demand for lawyers with relevant experience, said Jason Johnson, managing partner at Sydney-based Johnson, an executive search firm. “Major law firms, those that participate in the financial and regulation space, are having an absolute purple patch,” he said.","Borrowers have begun to feel the squeeze, according to Sydney real estate agent Peter Wong, as banks dig through credit histories and ask borrowers for bigger deposits.

Recipient: U.S. House of Representatives

Dear Representative,

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 200 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, I write to express our opposition to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (the “farm bill”). The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), specifically the expansion of stringent work requirements, will threaten the economic security of low-income individuals across the country. Congress should instead combat hunger and food insecurity by protecting and strengthening SNAP in a bipartisan farm bill. We urge you to vote no on H.R. 2 to protect the millions of people across the country who depend on SNAP to access adequate nutrition for themselves and their families. The Leadership Conference will score your position on H.R. 2 in our voting record for the second session of the 115th Congress.



The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is concerned by attempts to further restrict food assistance to low-income individuals, endangering their economic security as well as that of their families. SNAP is the most effective anti-hunger program in the country, helping 1 in 8 Americans afford a basic diet.[i] The right to food, recognized in Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,[ii] guarantees freedom from hunger and access to safe and nutritious food. SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in the communities that we represent, and it is the first line of defense against hunger for many low-income individuals. As of February 2018, the program helps about 40 million people in 20 million households put food on the table.[iii] SNAP has also played a significant role in reducing poverty: the program moved 8.4 million people out of poverty in 2015, reducing the poverty rate from 15.4 percent to 12.8 percent.[iv]

Though lawmakers have historically worked on a bipartisan basis on the farm bill, that unfortunately has not been the case this year. Instead, on partisan lines, the House Committee on Agriculture has put forward a bill that would take away SNAP from “more than 1 million low-income households with more than 2 million people – particularly low-income working families with children,” and would cut more than $20 billion from SNAP over 10 years.[v] The harsh new requirements that it would impose would result in taking nutrition assistance away from the individuals that need them the most, disproportionately harming people of color, women, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly. For communities of color, who experience food insecurity at higher rates compared with all U.S. households, changes to the SNAP program could make a major difference in their ability to get food on the table. In 2016, food insecurity affected 23 percent of African American households[vi] and 19 percent of Latino households.[vii] Given the existing institutional barriers that communities of color face in achieving economic security, any efforts to further restrict access to nutrition assistance programs could be particularly devastating. The nutrition provisions of the farm bill passed on party lines by the House Committee on Agriculture on April 18 would increase food insecurity and hardship for some of the most vulnerable individuals living in America.[viii]

As SNAP is currently structured, the program already encourages work. Among SNAP participants who can work, most do. In households with at least one working-age, non-disabled adult, 59 percent were employed while receiving SNAP, and 81 percent were employed prior to or after receiving SNAP.[ix] Individuals are more likely to participate in SNAP when they are out of work, and for many non-disabled adults, receipt of SNAP is already short-term.

Under the proposed work requirement provision in H.R. 2, individuals who are not able to submit proof of employment or participation in a work program face the possibility of having no access to nutrition assistance for anywhere from one to three years.[x] Some of the most vulnerable communities that depend on SNAP may be at risk of losing benefits under the provisions of H.R. 2. This includes:

2 million women who participated in SNAP in 2016, representing 63 percent of adult recipients[xi];

13 million African Americans[xii] and 10 million Latinos[xiii] who participated in SNAP in 2016;

Over 6 million people with disabilities who participated in SNAP in 2016, including 4 million non-elderly adults who receive disability benefits, approximately 2 million who don’t receive disability benefits but have work-limiting health conditions, and many children[xiv];

9 million children who participated in SNAP in 2016, representing about 44 percent of participants[xv];

At least 1.3 million LGB adults aged 18 to 44 who participated in SNAP in 2016 [xvi];

Some 5.1 million seniors aged 60 and over who received SNAP in 2016, and an additional 4.2 million older Americans aged 50 through 59 who got SNAP each month[xvii]; and

5 million veterans who live in households that participated in SNAP in 2016.[xviii]

If signed into law, H.R. 2 would require that SNAP recipients ages 18-59 who are not disabled or raising a child under the age of six to provide monthly documentation that they are working a minimum of 20 hours a week, participating at least 20 hours a week in a work program, or engaging in some combination of these two activities.[xix] This new administrative burden would create additional challenges and make an already complex system more difficult to navigate for individuals in need of SNAP assistance. As SNAP currently stands, adults without a disability ages 18-49 who also do not have custody of dependent children are limited to only three months of SNAP in a 36-month period unless they are able to find work or job training activities for at least 20 hours per week.[xx] SNAP’s time limit rule does provide states with the ability to seek waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to temporarily suspend the three-month limit for individuals in areas with high unemployment or insufficient job opportunities.[xxi] In 2007, to address the Great Recession’s impact on job loss and increased hardship for unemployed workers, Congress temporarily expanded the circumstances under which a state could apply for such a waiver.[xxii] These waivers have been an invaluable resource to those individuals who need SNAP to help get food on the table, but who might face additional hardship in securing adequate documentation to prove their employment or in finding secure employment opportunities that meet the mandated work requirements. When several states re-instated the time limit in 2016, at least 500,000 able bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) lost access to food provided through SNAP.[xxiii]

Proponents of H.R. 2 have argued that implementing work requirements help people find work, but the reality is that most working-age adults on SNAP who can work do so. Supporters of H.R. 2 have said that the bill would require states to provide work program slots to individuals who are not exempt from work requirements and who cannot find employment for at least 20 hours a week. The reality of how this would work in practice is quite different. The level of investment proposed in H.R. 2 is severely inadequate to ensure proper education and training for current SNAP participants who would be subject to these stringent work requirements and time limits. As is, the bill authorizes only $7.65 billion over 10 years for education and training programs. This equals only $30 per participant per month to serve the 3 million people who will need work slots and directly conflicts with research which has shown that the cost of operating effective programs that promote opportunity ranges from about $7,500 to $14,000 per participant.[xxiv] A May 2018 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report found that states would not be able to offer job training opportunities to all recipients by the time the requirement takes effect in 2021. In fact, CBO found that by 2028 only 80 percent of SNAP recipients subject to work requirements would be offered the training program based on funding outlined in H.R. 2.

The inclusion of stricter work requirements in H.R. 2 would harm – not help – SNAP recipients. Although SNAP encourages work, SNAP participants are generally low-income, low-skill working people with a limited range of job prospects. Despite a decline in the national unemployment rate, continued wage stagnation and limited economic opportunities mean that many working people are still struggling to make ends meet. The nature of today’s low-wage labor market is characterized by unstable and low-quality jobs, one in which low-wage working people often need SNAP to cover the cost of food either while they are working, or to help bridge a period between jobs.

Since working people with volatile schedules experience instability and unpredictability in their hours, programs that impose work requirements pose a unique challenge for these individuals.[xxv] Compounding these challenges, 83 percent of part-time workers report having unstable work schedules.[xxvi] About half of low-wage hourly workers do not have 9-to-5, Monday-through-Friday jobs.[xxvii] A recent study found that 40 percent of hourly workers ages 26 to 32 receive one week or less advance notice of their job schedules.[xxviii] Unstable schedules make it difficult for working people to arrange transportation, arrange child care, attend job training or school, hold a second job, manage their budgets, and maintain a stable income.[xxix]

The expansion of work requirements is particularly problematic for individuals with disabilities, for whom navigating the employment landscape may be significantly more challenging. Even where individuals do not qualify for a federal disability benefit, they still may face significant barriers to working 20 or more hours per week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that working people with disabilities are nearly twice as likely as working people with no disability to be employed part-time.[xxx] Furthermore, in a May 2012 report, BLS reported that half of working-age adults with a disability who were not working reported barriers to employment, including a lack of transportation and the need for accommodations in a workplace.[xxxi] Because of the historic unemployment and underemployment of people with disabilities, which current workforce and SNAP employment systems are not adequately structured or funded to solve, expanding work requirements would result in the loss of crucial nutrition assistance for millions of low-income individuals with disabilities.

College students, who generally fall into the age range of recipients that would be subject to stricter work requirements, would also face additional challenges in trying to access adequate nutrition. This is particularly concerning as food insecurity on college campuses disproportionately impacts students of color and low-income students. A study by Wisconsin’s HOPE Lab found that 47 percent of Black students and 42 percent of Hispanic students at 4-year institutions experience food insecurity in comparison to 30 percent of their White peers.[xxxii] Yet, according to the USDA,“[m]ost able-bodied students ages 18 through 49 who are enrolled in college or other institutions of higher education at least half time are not eligible for SNAP benefits.”[xxxiii] Though the federal work-study program creates an exemption opportunity[xxxiv], students may still face barriers to enrolling in SNAP. Furthermore, not every school participates in the work-study program; where schools have work-study programs, jobs are often limited and not guaranteed from year to year. This leaves low-income college students without any support to help them avoid food insecurity. Imposing even more stringent work requirements on students will only exacerbate the challenges they face to accessing the nutrition that they need.

The Leadership Conference supports the goal of helping people find work, but it is imperative that we do so by providing employment opportunities that have sufficient hours, livable wages, and institutional systems and policies that allow working people to support themselves and their families. Without these types of supports, a job alone is not sufficient to promote food security, well-being, and economic mobility. There are a variety of remedies that would allow all working people, and specifically those enrolled in public benefit programs, to have jobs that provide fair wages, promote productivity, and allow them to care for themselves and/or their families. This includes passing legislation that would raise the minimum wage, ensure fair work scheduling, provide paid family and medical leave and paid sick days, expand Medicaid eligibility, and address basic living standards.[xxxv]

The Leadership Conference believes that H.R. 2 is a flawed bill that will exacerbate the already striking consequences of the tax law passed by Congress late last year. The nutrition title in H.R. 2 includes benefit cuts and harsh new requirements that, among other problems, would hurt many low-income working families, children, and individuals who struggle to find stable employment. Imposing barriers to food assistance will not incentivize or equip people with what they need to seek and maintain work. It will only result in many SNAP participants losing critical food assistance, increase hardship, and further widen inequality.[xxxvi] For these reasons, we urge you to vote no on H.R. 2. If you have any questions, contact Emily Chatterjee, Senior Counsel, at [email protected].

Vanita Gupta

Migration can be voluntary or involuntary, but most of the time a combination of choices and constraints lead some to leave, while others stay behind. What needs do people have while on the road? Are those needs different based on the reason for leaving home? What distinguishes someone who is displaced internally from someone who has crossed an international border?

EDITORIAL: MIGRATION AND DISPLACEMENT: HUMANITY WITH ITS BACK TO THE WALL

Crowds of people on the move with their bundles of possessions, young men frantically scaling fences, boatloads of women and children pummelled by the waves, bodies washed up the beach, camps with endless rows of tents and chaotic shanty towns stretching as far as the eye can see, transit centres where hopes fade, humiliated workers forced to do jobs nobody else wants, mothers waiting a lifetime in vain for news of daughters or sons who left to seek their fortune elsewhere. These are some of the images that might come to mind when picturing the plight of uprooted people around the world. Vincent Bernard, Editor-in-Chief

""ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW"": TESTIMONIES OF THE FAMILIES OF MISSING MIGRANTS IN ZIMBABWE

Every day, people all over the world leave their homes in search of a better life. On the road, many go missing. The mandate of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence includes, in certain contexts, protection of vulnerable migrants. The ICRC missing migrants pilot project aims to locate or clarify the fate of Zimbabwean migrants who went missing in South Africa, on behalf of their families. The ICRC aims to work with South African and Zimbabwean authorities to support and enhance existing systems, tools and resources used for locating missing relatives, living or dead. Additionally, the ICRC carries out and supports the activities of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the region to restore contact between and where possible reunify family members, in particular children, who have been separated by conflict, migration, displacement or natural or man-made disasters.The Review has chosen to open this issue with the stories of family members of missing migrants in Zimbabwe. The section aims to show the everyday struggle, sometimes lasting for many years, of those that live with continuous uncertainty regarding the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. As a result of the disappearances associated with migration, families searching for missing relatives often face a range of needs and challenges. These persons chose to share their life stories with the Review, allowing our readers to understand the intricate balance of uncertainty, hope and the “need to know” that family members of missing migrants live with every day. The testimonies were given to the ICRC in Zimbabwe in November 2017. In order to protect the families, their names have been omitted.

INTERVIEW WITH FILIPPO GRANDI

The tradition of providing refuge to people who are fleeing and in need of protection is a long-standing one, present throughout history and in various contexts, and now embedded in international law. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2016, reaffirmed international refugee protection standards and provided a model for a more comprehensive response to large-scale refugee movements, based on shared global responsibility for refugees. It represented a critical development at a time when international cooperation aimed at preventing, responding to and resolving conflicts is proving inadequate, and an increasing number of people are being internally displaced, forced across borders or left in protracted exile as a result of conflict, violence and persecution. In this interview, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees shares his thoughts on some of today’s most significant forced displacement challenges, and the prospects presented by the New York Declaration.

MOBILISING THE MOVEMENT: AUSTRALIAN RED CROSS, MIGRATION, AND THE ROLE OF THE RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT MOVEMENT AROUND HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

Established in war, embedded in communities and operational in every major natural and man-made disaster, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) – including 191 National Societies – is uniquely positioned to address the humanitarian needs of migrants at all points of their journey. With migration on the rise and an area of intense debate, this article examines the work of Australian Red Cross and the collective efforts of the International Federation of Red Cross Red and Red Crescent Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Asia Pacific Migration Network, particularly across 2015–17, to support the Movement in the region in providing assistance and protection to those who are most vulnerable. It considers the progress made so far, and the potential of the Movement to engage more effectively and collaboratively on opportunities and challenges into the future.

BRITISH RED CROSS RESPONSE TO YOUNG MIGRANTS IN CALAIS, FRANCE

In 2016, thousands of young migrants were stranded in Calais, France, in the “Jungle” refugee camp. This paper aims to provide an overview of the British Red Cross’s response and of how the organization engaged in numerous activities to secure their safety, culminating in a transfer of children to the United Kingdom.

ASSISTANCE FOR AND PROTECTION OF MIGRANTS: EXPERIENCE OF THE HONDURAN RED CROSS

The Honduran Red Cross began working in the area of migration in July 2012, when it set up the Migrant Assistance Module in Corinto for Honduran migrants returning over land at the Honduran–Guatemalan border. The Honduran Red Cross has helped hundreds of returning and irregular migrants, thanks to agreements with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Migration Institute. It has also worked with other National Red Cross Societies in the region, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which have helped it to strengthen its capacity and build a comprehensive vision for the protection and assistance of migrants. This article summarizes the action that the Honduran Red Cross has undertaken with respect to migration and explores the services provided at the Corinto module, the Honduran Red Cross’s subsequent management of the Returning Migrant Assistance Centre in Omoa and other care centres for migrants returning because of their irregular status, and the development and implementation of projects on migration and related topics.

DISPLACEMENT IN NIGERIA: SCENES FROM THE NORTHEAST

Now in its ninth year, the armed conflict in Nigeria has forced more than 2 million people from their homes, with more than 1.5 million of these displaced within the country. The regionalized conflict – which since 2013 has affected the neighbouring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger – has caused a protracted humanitarian crisis with some of the highest human costs in the world. In the following gallery, photographer Newsha Tavakolian gives us a glimpse into the lives of displaced persons in northeastern Nigeria.

BETWEEN HOSPITALITY AND ASYLUM: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON DISPLACED AGENCY

This article aims at positioning the agency of the displaced within the longue durée, as it is exposed in contexts of hospitality and asylum, by articulating its key modes: contingent, willed and compelled. Using the ancient world as its starting point, the article exposes the duplicity in conceiving of the current condition of displacement as transient or exceptional. As such, it argues for the urgent need of a shift in the perception of displaced persons from that of impotent victims to potent agents, and to engage with the new forms of exceptional politics which their circumstances engender.

ADDRESSING THE PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE NEEDS OF MIGRANTS: THE ICRC APPROACH TO MIGRATION

The vulnerability of migrants and the threats to which they are exposed during their journey, on land, at sea, or in countries where they have settled, raise serious humanitarian concerns that cannot be ignored. In view of the transregional nature of migration, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) draw on their presence all along migration routes to contribute to the humanitarian response and alleviate the suffering of vulnerable migrants. The Movement’s proximity to vulnerable migrants through its solid and experienced network of responders along migratory routes is one of its specific advantages. The aim of this article is to explain the ICRC’s view on and approach to migration. It underlines that the ICRC’s response is dictated by humanitarian needs, and stresses that these needs can be greatly reduced when States abide by their commitments under international law and adopt and implement policies that take into account the protection and assistance needs of migrants. It acknowledges the diverse and complex human realities behind migration and outlines the main protection and assistance concerns of migrants in countries and regions where the ICRC operates.

THE PROTECTION OF MIGRANTS UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW

The movement of migrants across international borders may result in grave humanitarian consequences and protection and assistance needs for those involved. Although many reach their destinations safely, others may find themselves in a country experiencing armed conflict – either because they live there or are travelling through there – and may endure great difficulties and be particularly vulnerable. In these situations, as civilians, migrants are protected under international humanitarian law (IHL) against the effects of hostilities and when in the hands of a party to the conflict. This article will provide an overview of the protection afforded by IHL to migrants as civilians in international and non- international armed conflicts. It will then examine more closely certain particularly relevant rules for the issue of migration, notably those related to the movement of migrants, family unity, and missing and dead migrants. In this way, this article will show that IHL provides important legal protections for migrants finding themselves in situations of armed conflict.

SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE IFRC’S APPROACH TO MIGRATION AND DISPLACEMENT

This article provides an overview of the development of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies’ (IFRC) approach to migration and displacement. The focus of the IFRC and its member National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (National Societies) in this regard has traditionally been on refugees and other so-called “displaced persons” – that is, people who have been compelled to flee their place or country of origin and for this reason are deemed to be particularly vulnerable. However, this focus has been extended recently, in the course of the past decade, to cover all people who find themselves in a vulnerable situation in the context of migration. The IFRC Migration Policy, which was adopted in 2009, has offered much-needed guidance to National Societies in dealing with all migrants, including irregular migrants. However, it is argued that there is a need today – taking into consideration the increasing number of displaced people worldwide and the numerous contexts in which National Societies are dealing with refugees, internally displaced persons or cross-border disaster-displaced persons – to better understand the programmatic aspects that are specific to displacement compared with migration. This is a necessary condition in view of the development of more adequate and effective responses to the vulnerabilities and needs of migrants and displaced persons.

MIGRATION AND DATA PROTECTION: DOING NO HARM IN AN AGE OF MASS DISPLACEMENT, MASS SURVEILLANCE AND “BIG DATA”

This article considers the key data protection challenges facing humanitarian organizations providing assistance to refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants. These challenges are particularly significant for several reasons: because data protection has come relatively late to the humanitarian sector; because humanitarian organizations are under pressure to innovate rapidly; because the global communications architecture on which many of these innovations depend is inherently vulnerable to State surveillance; and because States are deploying increasingly sophisticated and coercive means to prevent irregular forms of migration and/or subjecting humanitarian organizations to surveillance and disruption. The first part of the article outlines the fundamental rights challenges presented by contemporary data-driven migration control paradigms. The second outlines concerns about “data-driven humanitarianism” and “mass surveillance” to show how humanitarian organizations risk inadvertently exacerbating these problems. The third assesses specific data protection challenges that humanitarian organizations face and the policies and practices they have developed in response. The article concludes with some brief observations on the technical and political dynamics shaping their efforts to comply with their legal and ethical obligations, and calls for the sector to work together to extend data protection norms and outlaw cyber-attacks by State actors.

OBLIGATIONS OF TRANSIT COUNTRIES UNDER REFUGEE LAW: A WESTERN BALKANS CASE STUDY

A significant increase in the number of arrivals of refugees and migrants in Europe along the Western Balkans route brought several Balkan countries into the spotlight of international refugee protection in 2015 and 2016. Out of hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants recorded entering the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia, only a handful remained to seek asylum from their authorities. Under the circumstances, the applicability of the 1951 Refugee Convention with respect to refugees refraining from seeking asylum was brought into question, as well as the extent of transit countries’ legal obligations under refugee law. Based on the Western Balkans experience, the present article seeks to re-examine the relationship between the concept of asylum and the regime of the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Convention’s scope of application in “transit countries”, and minimal standards stemming from positive law regarding the treatment of refugees and migrants in a transit context.

IN THE NAME OF (DE)SECURITIZATION: SPEAKING SECURITY TO PROTECT MIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS?

This article examines how the protection of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) is spoken about and framed. Today it is evident that the dominant responses of sovereign States to each of these groups is heavily reliant on the language of security and (de)securitization, and this article openly conceptualizes ongoing attempts to protect migrants, refugees and IDPs as a series of overlapping (de)securitized “games”. At least three arguments follow from this claim. First, adopting this approach serves as a reminder that the ways in which different groups of people are spoken about often constitutes a dividing line between life and death. Second, the language games of (de)securitization are not identical when it comes to protecting different groups. Third, using securitization as the theoretical point of departure provides a timely reminder that none of the three categorizations listed above is guaranteed to apply. On the contrary, the adoption of each linguistic label – migrant, refugee, IDP – is subject to and dependent upon audience acceptance. Remembering the latter dimension is imperative to fully comprehend the ongoing contestations and countermoves in response to people moving in search of security. By way of conclusion, the article contends that far more attention must be paid to broader understandings of acceptance and love to ensure the protection of migrants, refugees and IDPs.

PROTECTING INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS: THE VALUE OF THE KAMPALA CONVENTION AS A REGIONAL EXAMPLE

This article examines the value of the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention) in the general quest for the regional and global protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs). It contends that the absence of a globally binding legal instrument for the protection of IDPs underlines the importance of the Kampala Convention and the possible contribution it can make to global and regional efforts to create a binding legal framework for the protection of IDPs. While recognizing some challenges that may impact the full implementation of the Convention, the article concludes by noting its various positive elements that are invaluable in overall efforts to create a comprehensive global legal framework to enhance protection of IDPs.

SPECIFICITIES AND CHALLENGES OF RESPONDING TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN URBAN SETTINGS

The world is rapidly urbanizing, and so is internal displacement. However, knowledge about the specific situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in urban settings and how it differs from, and impacts on, their host communities is still limited, and responses continue to be inadequate. This article analyzes the particular needs of urban IDPs by taking into account how the various contexts and patterns of urban internal displacement contribute to shaping people’s experience. It discusses three key challenges that humanitarian actors are faced with in developing effective responses: identifying and reaching IDPs in urban settings, addressing their urgent protection concerns, and supporting their local integration. It concludes by pointing out the need for methodological and operational guidance on how to bring together area-based approaches that account for the impact of displacement on entire urban communities, and tailored approaches addressing IDPs’ specific needs in urban settings. The need for stocktaking exercises and more effective sharing of experiences among practitioners, municipal authorities and policy-makers is also underlined.

DO NO HARM: A TAXONOMY OF THE CHALLENGES OF HUMANITARIAN EXPERIMENTATION

This article aims to acknowledge and articulate the notion of “humanitarian experimentation”. Whether through innovation or uncertain contexts, managing risk is a core component of the humanitarian initiative – but all risk is not created equal. There is a stark ethical and practical difference between managing risk and introducing it, which is mitigated in other fields through experimentation and regulation. This article identifies and historically contextualizes the concept of humanitarian experimentation, which is increasingly prescient, as a range of humanitarian subfields embark on projects of digitization and privatization. This trend is illustrated here through three contemporary examples of humanitarian innovations (biometrics, data modelling, cargo drones), with references to critical questions about adherence to the humanitarian “do no harm” imperative. This article outlines a broad taxonomy of harms, intended to serve as the starting point for a more comprehensive conversation about humanitarian action and the ethics of experimentation.

NOTE ON MIGRATION AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REFOULEMENT, ICRC, 2018

Throughout history, high numbers of persons have left, or have been forced to leave, their countries of origin. In order to protect migrants or refugees against being returned to places in which their fundamental rights are in danger, States have developed the principle of non-refoulement. This principle, reflected in different bodies of international law, protects any person from being transferred (returned, expelled, extradited—whatever term is used) from one authority to another when there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to violations of certain fundamental rights. The principle is multi-faceted and its scope and application vary from context to context in accordance with the applicable law. The present note recalls the legal basis of the principle of non-refoulement in different bodies of international law, examines its scope of application, and presents how certain aspects of the principle have been interpreted by States, courts, human rights treaty bodies, or expert organizations. The note also explains – where relevant – which understanding of the principle of non-refoulement the ICRC follows in its dialogue with States.

ICRC POLICY PAPER ON IMMIGRATION DETENTION

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has worked on behalf of detained irregular migrants for many years as part of its activities for detainee populations in general, but has only recently started implementing specific programmes for detained migrants in countries of transit and destination. The ICRC visits detained migrants in both criminal and dedicated immigration detention facilities. During these visits, as with all detainees, the ICRC assesses whether detained migrants are treated humanely, held in conditions that preserve their dignity and afforded due process of law. The ICRC also evaluates whether they are able to maintain contact with the outside world, such as with their families and consular authorities, if they wish to do so. As part of its dialogue with the authorities, the ICRC also raises protection issues related to return to ensure that the authorities fulfil their obligations under relevant international law – in particular with respect to the principle of non-refoulement.

TRANSLATING THE KAMPALA CONVENTION INTO PRACTICE: A STOCKTAKING EXERCISE

In 2016, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carried out a study to take stock of current progress in implementing the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (the Kampala Convention). As the first ever legally binding international instrument of its kind, the Kampala Convention represents a significant step forward in reaffirming the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the face of a growing displacement problem in Africa. The stocktaking exercise grew because of the recognition of the value of the Kampala Convention and the urgent need to make it as effective as possible. The ICRC was involved from the outset in the drafting of the Kampala Convention and, since its adoption, has been working on promoting its ratification and implementation. The stocktaking exercise, therefore, is part of the ICRC's continuous support to the Kampala Convention. It is also an additional step within the framework of the ICRC's long-term operational engagement in addressing the needs of the displaced and their host communities affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence in Africa. At the origin of the stocktaking exercise was also the observation that several States have undertaken – or are undertaking – important action to domesticate and operationalize the Kampala Convention, but they have tended to do so in isolation. The ICRC felt there was a need to compile the diverse experiences of States in order to bolster efforts to fully implement the Convention, by allowing States to learn from each other about how the Convention can work best. The study examined the practice of twenty-five African countries in which the ICRC is operating – these include not only States party to the Kampala Convention, but also other States not yet party who have taken action on internal displacement in the form of normative, policy or concrete measures. The focus has been on those obligations that are based in international humanitarian law or touch on humanitarian issues that the ICRC encounters in operations across Africa. The findings were published in a report that identifies lessons learned, best practices and key challenges in States' efforts to meet their obligations towards IDPs, as provided in the Kampala Convention. The report offers recommendations to States and other actors concerned (African Union, Regional Economic Communities, UN agencies, civil society organizations, etc.) on how to translate the Kampala Convention into real improvements for IDPs. The report is being used by ICRC delegations in Africa in bilateral discussions with States on their obligations to protect and assist IDPs, and to provide them with durable solutions. It is also used to support the adoption by States of national legal frameworks and policies as part of their responses to situations of internal displacement. At the continental level, the report informs the ICRC's long-standing cooperation with the African Union and sub-regional forums (e.g. the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the Economic Community of West African States) on promoting ratification of the Kampala Convention and strengthening its implementation. For example, the report served as a starting point for discussions among experts during the first meeting of the Conference of States Party to the Kampala Convention that was held in Harare in April 2017. According to the framework of the Plan of Action adopted by the Conference, the ICRC is to support further initiatives to enhance awareness of the Kampala Convention and facilitate the sharing of experience and expertise among States on its implementation. The report's findings and recommendations are also proving to be useful in the ICRC's dialogue with States in other regions beyond Africa, insofar as they provide examples of measures that States can adopt to address internal displacement more effectively at the national and regional levels.

FORCED TO FLEE: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE ON INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT, MIGRATION AND REFUGEE CRISES, SOAS UNIVERSITY OF LONDON, ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL, UNIVERSITY OF EXETER, BRITISH RED CROSS AND ICRC

""Forced to Flee"" was a multidisciplinary two-day conference on internal displacement, migration and refugee crises, jointly organized by SOAS University of London, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the University of Exeter, the British Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It brought together some sixty researchers, independent and UK government policy-makers, and senior humanitarian practitioners.

AIDE-MEMOIRE: OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE ON MAINTAINING THE CIVILIAN AND HUMANITARIAN CHARACTER OF SITES AND SETTLEMENTS

In light of the growing complexity of humanitarian crises today and the continued need for effective cooperation among humanitarian actors, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) launched a consultative process in September 2016 to collect operational practices with regard to maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites and settlements for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. Exchanges with field staff from both organizations targeted five ongoing operations–in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan – and included a one-day workshop in Geneva on 20 April 2017 in which the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) also participated. A wider set of stakeholders was consulted as well, during a roundtable organized under the auspices of the Global Protection Cluster (GPC) on 21 April.This aide-memoire draws on the above-mentioned consultations to provide operational guidance for humanitarian actors in maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites and settlements (hereinafter referred to as sites) in situations of armed conflict. Part 1 of this guidance sets out the necessary context and principles with regard to the civilian and humanitarian character of sites. It provides a description of the main operational challenges and dilemmas that humanitarian actors confront and examines the content of applicable legal frameworks. Part 2 offers measures for humanitarian actors to consider – within the remit of their respective expertise, experience and mandates – when working toward maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites. These measures include efforts to engage actors beyond the humanitarian community in the spirit of complementarity and in respect of humanitarian principles.

BOOK REVIEW: REFUGEES IN EXTENDED EXILE: LIVING ON THE EDGE

Statistics show that long-term displacement is the new normal. In the absence of solutions to their exile, people remain trapped in permanent temporariness for years – or decades in the case of Somalians, Afghans or Palestinians. The traditional “durable solutions” bringing exile to an end are elusive: only a few hundred thousand refugees return home every year, few States hosting refugees in the global South are willing to allow them to settle permanently in their country, and less than 1% of the refugee population are being offered resettlement in a third country.

New York – Nigeria told the UN General Assembly in New York that the Boko Haram terrorists no longer held any territory in the country.

Nigeria’s Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Samson Itegboje, stated this while presenting Nigeria’s message at the ‘High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace’ at the UN headquarters.

Itegboje said the meeting was being convened at a time when the global community was facing unprecedented threats, geo-political tensions, social dislocation, cyber attacks, threat of climate change and terrorism.

“Nigeria has had her fair share of these crises when, amongst other vices. Boko Haram insurgents annexed 14 Local Governments in Borno in the North East of Nigeria.

“However, on assumption of office in 2015 President Muhammadu Buhari ensured the recovery of the annexed territories. Today, Boko Haram insurgents no longer hold any territory in Nigeria,” he said.

He noted that Resolutions 70/262 of the General Assembly and 2282 (2016) of the Security Council on the Review of the UN Peacebuilding Architecture addressed the UN approach to peace, focusing on prevention.

The Resolutions also call for a broader concept, which encompasses peace building, that links peace and security with development, human rights and humanitarian action.

Itegboje said: “Nigeria is of the opinion that, while ‘sustaining peace’ should not be seen as an infringement on sovereignty.

“It should also not be used as a guise for the infringement on sovereignty of member states as the centrality of national and inclusive ownership of sustaining peace cannot be overemphasised.

“The emphasis on prevention is commendable and we recommend that the Peacebuilding Architecture should have, as a component, an Early Warning System that should be accompanied by an Early Action System”.

Itegboje said Nigeria had consistently been in the vanguard of supporting and participating in international efforts at conflict-prevention, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and sustaining peace both sub-regionally, regionally and globally.

He said since 1960, Nigeria had been an active participant in UN peacekeeping missions, deploying Military contingents, unarmed Military Observers, Military Staff Officers, formed Police units, Police advisor and Civilian Experts to over 25 UN Missions.

The Nigerian envoy also noted that Nigeria was the world’s 14th largest troops contributing nation to the UN peacekeeping operations.

According to him, Nigeria shares the view that the maintenance of human rights is critical to sustaining peace and has embarked on mainstreaming human rights into its security architecture.

“In this context, progress has been made in enhancing civil-military relations, establishing legislative oversight on the security sector in relation to defence spending, procurement and general budgetary matters.

“Efforts have also been stepped up to create a better partnership between civilians and armed forces,” the Nigerian envoy said.

He said Nigeria believed that ensuring the meaningful participation of women and girls in all areas of society was vital, adding gender equality yields greater economic growth and higher standards of living.

He added that women’s participation in peacebuilding helped prevent relapse into conflict and Nigerian was addressing emerging security issues, social gaps and ensuring substantial women contributions to peacebuilding and peace maintenance in the country.

Itegboje said the Nigerian government was tackling youth unemployment through interventionist programmes like N-POWER and an ambitious three-year medium term economic development strategy – Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.

The Nigerian envoy added: “More importantly, corruption is being tackled headlong as it is seen as a big obstacle to the economic growth of the country.

“Nigeria will continue to support international efforts aimed at peace building and sustaining peace across the world.

“In order to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, we call on the rest of the world to emulate and join Africa in its ambitious program to silence the guns in the year 2020”. (NAN)

78,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/22/untouchable-no-more-india-dalit-bridegroom-rejecting-class-prejudice,"Tue, 22 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Untouchable no more: the Dalit bridegroom rejecting class prejudice,"The dusty, nondescript road has long been a no-go area, on pain of death, for bridegrooms from the Dalit caste and their wedding processions.

In July, however, on a date yet to be fixed, Sanjay Kumar Jadav, 27, will lead his parade of male relatives – called the “baraat” – down the road in Nizampur village. The group will pass the houses of upper caste Hindus who fear they will be “tainted” by his passing, to where his fiancee Sheetal lives. There, the couple will be married.



Jadav is a new kind of Dalit, the lowest caste in Hinduism. Formerly known as untouchables, the Dalits are fed up with the humiliating customs and class prejudice they have endured, and are mobilising against a system that refuses to wither away.

Slightly greater prosperity and higher levels of education have made the younger generation aspirational. They won’t turn away from a fight. There is a new assertiveness.

Jadav is confident, educated – studying law at Aligarh Muslim University – and ready to take on any social rule that degrades or diminishes him. His position as a social worker in his village, using his education to help people of all castes apply for ID cards and welfare benefits, has reinforced his self-respect.



“I refuse to be defined by my caste. I am much more than that,” he says during a visit to New Delhi, the Indian capital. When he first announced last year that he planned to take his baraat past the exclusion zone where the upper caste, land-owning Thakurs live, outrage erupted.

“The Thakurs told me no Dalit had ever done anything so outrageous. Dalit bridegrooms are expected to take the route on the outskirts of the village, avoiding the main road. We are not allowed to ride a horse. We have to walk. They said it was against tradition. I said it was time to destroy that tradition,” he says.

Jadav went further and ordered himself a horse and a band. In some places, Dalit bridegrooms have been killed or beaten up by upper caste men for riding a horse, because it is seen as insubordination. Nor are they allowed to sport a moustache or wear sunglasses.



Jadav took his case to the local court and then the high court in Allahabad. His petition was dismissed. The more obstacles he faced, the more determined he became.

In April, by way of punishment for his persistence in the courts, the Thakurs in Nizampur cut off water to Dalit fields. “The cauliflower, cucumber, chilli, tomato and onions all died. It was a warning. Sheetal has heard the Thakurs saying that, once the wedding is over and the police have gone, they will have their revenge,” he says.

In Sheetal’s village, the 50 Thakur families outnumber the 15 Dalit households. As a child, Jadav lived in a village where power was more balanced, with 400 Dalit families and about 420 Thakur.

Yet he still remembers being refused drinking water by a Thakur. One day, he saw musicians performing at a festival. The main artist was playing the dholak, a cylindrical drum. Members of the high-caste audience sat on the ground while the drummer played on the raised stage.



“I decided there and then to learn to play the dholak, purely to be on a stage, to be on a higher level, while the upper castes sit below me. It took me two years, but I play it rather well now and I feel good when I look down on them,” he says, grinning. “It’s symbolic.”

As an educated Dalit, he believes he must use his schooling to fight for his community’s rights. “I knew I had to get an education to fight for my rights. Now if I, as an educated person, can’t get justice for my community, then who will?



“Am I not a Hindu? If I am not, let the government tell me and I will find another religion. Am I not a citizen? Don’t I have the right to walk down a public road as guaranteed by the constitution? Shouldn’t the police come out and support my right instead of telling me to back off because of tradition?”

Jadav had hoped that some politicians would back his demand. However, while the ruling Bharatiya Janata party is acutely conscious of the importance of winning the votes of 200 million Dalits in next year’s election – the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has told his MPs to dine at a Dalit house once a month as a gesture of solidarity – no one in the BJP or any other party has spoken out in support of him.

Nonetheless, after months of wrangling in Nizampur, a truce was finally reached last month. Prodded by the police and the media storm, the Thakurs agreed to let his wedding procession travel along the main road.

A new route has been chalked out. The band and white horse are booked. Invitations to the media have gone out. Armed police will be posted on the route.

But he won’t be surprised if he sees some empty homes as he rides down the main road at the head of the procession. “Some Thakurs have said they are leaving their homes on the day because they won’t be able to bear the sight.

“Isn’t that funny?”","The dusty, nondescript road has long been a no-go area, on pain of death, for bridegrooms from the Dalit caste and their wedding processions.
The group will pass the houses of upper caste Hindus who fear they will be “tainted” by his passing, to where his fiancee Sheetal lives.
When he first announced last year that he planned to take his baraat past the exclusion zone where the upper caste, land-owning Thakurs live, outrage erupted.
Dalit bridegrooms are expected to take the route on the outskirts of the village, avoiding the main road.
In some places, Dalit bridegrooms have been killed or beaten up by upper caste men for riding a horse, because it is seen as insubordination."

Somewhere in the large and crowded tent a baby, born three days ago, cries. Outside, women gather around a fire that serves as their stove and, as shadows lengthen, their warmth for the night.

""This is my home,"" 37-year-old Alisa Jozana says, spreading her arms and smiling ironically. Home is the narrow couch she sits on. She says she's been here since July. ""No one cares about us. No one.""

This collection of tents on the edge of a sports field is what the city of Johannesburg considers appropriate alternative housing while something more permanent is arranged. The tents hold more than 200 people evicted from inner-city buildings that authorities say have been ""hijacked"" by squatters.

Tens of thousands more people, by some estimates as many as 100 000, are living in hundreds of abandoned buildings across downtown Johannesburg, one of Africa's wealthiest cities but also one of the world's most unequal, according to the World Bank.

The mayor wants the squatters cleared out to make way for an urban revival, with proposals to expropriate buildings and turn them over to private developers.

""The city can confirm 432 buildings as hijacked as of March,"" a spokesman for the mayor's office, Omogolo Taunyane, said in an email to The Associated Press.

The mayor is committed to finding solutions to ""bring dignity back to our poorest residents,"" Taunyane said.

The abandoned buildings make an often dangerous home. Last month, three children were killed when a wall collapsed on them in the building their families shared with about 300 people.

For eight months the residents had asked city officials for emergency housing, knowing conditions were not safe. The city failed them, their lawyers said.

Some of Johannesburg's decaying blocks have been turned into upscale venues with art galleries and coffee shops, the first steps to restoring vibrancy to the city's downtown that many fled in the waning years of apartheid, or white minority rule, which ended in the early 1990s.

But Mayor Herman Mashaba has alarmed residents of South Africa's largest city of more than 4.4 million people by accusing migrants from other countries for making up the majority of squatters, contributing to the xenophobia that periodically flares into violent attacks. Foreigners ""are not the responsibility of the city,"" he said last year.

This ""extremely unfortunate rhetoric"" is what sets the current eviction plans apart from those of previous administrations, said Stuart Wilson, executive director of the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa.

The organization represents people in up to 20 buildings across the city and about 80% of them are South African, he said.

On visits to ""hijacked"" buildings by the AP, residents said they are disgusted by their living conditions. Some work as security guards, domestic workers and small traders in neighbourhoods nearby. Others are unemployed, hustle or turn to crime. They want to see redevelopment that would give them a proper home, not force them to leave.

That plan has run into trouble after a Constitutional Court ruling last year emphasized the obvious: The city cannot evict people without offering proper alternatives — even if they consent to go.

""The city's plans are to provide a mere 364 new beds in temporary accommodation this year. That is a tiny fraction of what is required,"" the socio-economic rights group said after the deadly wall collapse. The state has the money and land and should provide housing at affordable prices, the group's executive director added, calling the city ""not particularly keen"" on public housing.

The previous administration said 16,000 housing units were needed for the inner city's ""most vulnerable"" residents alone, according to a report it released with U.N.-Habitat in 2016. The current administration says overall it faces a housing backlog of 300,000 units.

For now, tens of thousands of squatters and others who say they pay nominal rents are left in a filthy limbo without basic services and at the mercy of Johannesburg's high rate of crime.

In one building the AP visited in the Berea neighbourhood, residents pleaded for assistance.

A toilet on the first floor overflowed with faeces, the room beyond it flooded with grey water. Behind a curtain, a woman lay on a bed in the shadows, a small child curled to her bare breasts. She was ill, said residents who walked in and out of the room with ease.

Shattered windows were stuffed with rags. There were no utilities. People use buckets for toilets and light candles at night despite being fearful of fires.

""There's no life. We're crying,"" said 34-year-old Siphokazi Siyaya, a mother of three who said she has lived in the building for eight years with up to 200 other people.

""Sometimes people are fighting, shooting in front of our children. We just want them to grow up safe.""

81,https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2018/05/no-fault-divorce-why-the-owens-v-owens-case-is-so-important/,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Lawyer Monthly Magazine,No-Fault Divorce: Why the Owens v Owens Case Is So Important,"On May 17 2018, the Supreme Court heard its first ever case on divorce itself rather than issues relating to finances or children. The family justice organisation Resolution was the only third party given permission to intervene in the appeal to the Supreme Court in support of Mrs Owens. Mills & Reeve represented Resolution on a pro bono basis. Below Lawyer Monthly hears from Nigel Shepherd, Head of Family Law at Mills & Reeve, and immediate past national chair of Resolution, on the vital role this case plays in divorce law history.

Irrespective of the outcome, the judgment in Owens v Owens will provide further momentum for the campaign to introduce a no-fault divorce system. It will also change significantly the way family lawyers advise their clients on the test to be applied in so-called “behaviour petitions” and the examples used to illustrate that advice.

So what are the key reasons for this case being so important?

Interpreting behaviour divorce

The sole ground for divorce in England & Wales is, and has been for almost 50 years, that the marriage has broken irretrievably. However, this has to be established by proving one or more of five “facts” – adultery, “behaviour”, desertion for two years, separation for two years with consent of the respondent and separation for five years where there is no consent.

Mr & Mrs Owens separated in February 2015. She petitioned for divorce on the basis of Mr Owens’ behaviour. He defended the petition and, unusually it resulted in a trial where the judge felt that her husband’s behaviour was insufficient to justify a divorce decree. She went to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the original judgment, leaving her with the final appeal to the Supreme Court. If they rule against her she will have to wait until February 2020 for the divorce.

The legal arguments in Owens centre on the interpretation of section 1 (2) (b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. This provides that in order to prove irretrievable breakdown the petitioner must establish “that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent”. This wording has in practice been invariably described as “unreasonable behaviour” but the key point in Owens was that this shorthand is not only inaccurate but more importantly is a linguistic trap that led the trial judge to apply the wrong legal test to the evidence.

The argument from Mrs Owens, was that the correct test was an almost entirely subjective one. In other words, it is the impact of the behaviour on the petitioner that matters, not how that behaviour might be viewed objectively by others. Furthermore, the behaviour itself does not have to be the reason the marriage has broken down. It just has to be the reason why the petitioner can “no longer reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.”

If the Supreme Court agrees with our interpretation it will mean a fundamental change to the way in which divorce petitions are drafted in the future. Even if the appeal fails, the analysis by the Supreme Court justices of the legal test in section 1 (2) (b) will require a shift in emphasis in the way we approach these cases.

No-fault divorce

Whatever the outcome, Owens highlights the reason why the law must be changed. If Mrs Owens loses she will be locked in a marriage that is clearly over until 2020. If she wins, she will have done so only by having to battle through three hearings at enormous financial and emotional cost and we will still have a divorce process that encourages blame.

The Supreme Court cannot of course change the substantive law, it can only interpret it. For many years, Resolution has been campaigning for no fault divorce, and in their recent survey 67% of members said that the current law makes it harder for separated parents to reach agreement and 90% that it makes it harder to reduce conflict and confrontation. That comes as no surprise to our family team at Mills & Reeve where we see this blame game undermining efforts to reach agreement through mediation, collaborative practice or negotiation.

There is no real principled opposition to reform now. We just need to get on with it.","On May 17 2018, the Supreme Court heard its first ever case on divorce itself rather than issues relating to finances or children.

82,https://www.marketingweek.com/ovo-energy-gender-neutral-sports-sponsorship-no-brainer/,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Marketing Week,Ovo Energy: Gender neutral sports sponsorship is a ‘no brainer’ – Marketing Week,"Tackling the gender pay gap in sports made perfect sense for a brand focused on hiring values driven people with a strong purpose at its heart, says Ovo Energy CEO Chris Houghton.

Ovo Energy has extended its positive change mantra to its sport sponsorship.

Ovo Energy’s decision to take a gender neutral approach to sports sponsorship was not a calculated move intended to generate headlines. Far from it, says CEO Chris Houghton, who describes the company’s desire to address the gender pay gap in cycling as a “no brainer”.

He explains that raising the prize fund for female cyclists taking part in the Women’s Tour (13-17 June) from €35,000 (£30,500) to €90,000 (£78,500) to match the men racing in the Tour of Britain (2-9 September) was simply the right thing to do when it signed up as the title sponsor. It has had a relationship with the competition since 2016, when it became a stage sponsor.

“When we were thinking about the sponsorship of the tours it never really crossed our minds not to support both the Tour of Britain and the Women’s Tour,” explains Houghton.

“They are all athletes and their gender is largely irrelevant. The public are calling out to watch more sport and whether it’s men’s or women’s sport is irrelevant. With the acceptance internally that it was just about sport and it was just about athletes, we wanted to make sure this was the approach we took across the board to ensure as much parity as possible.”

Houghton describes cycling as the perfect fit for Ovo Energy as it is both the “ultimate sustainable mode of transport” and a sport focused on data and innovation. He sees a natural synergy between cycling and Ovo Energy’s data-driven sustainability work around battery storage, electric vehicles and finding ways to make electricity cheaper and greener.

“We want the world to wake up to the fact that we are probably the first generation to understand that we are in real trouble when it comes to environmental issues and certainly one of the last that can do anything about it,” says Houghton.

“We are doing a lot of innovation in that space in terms of green energy and making things more efficient and [the Tour sponsorship] was an obvious platform for getting that message across.”

Ovo has taken a gender neutral approach to its sponsorship of the Women’s Tour and Tour of Britain cycling events.

From a brand perspective, the sponsorship is both an awareness and engagement driver, rather than an excuse to force a “corporate message down people’s throats”. Ovo Energy hopes to use the Tour of Britain and the Women’s Tour as a platform to tell a story about the brand, rather that simply show it exists.

“We want to use the credibility we have there to say ‘there’s a right and wrong way of doing things and we’re the type of company that does things this way’. If you believe in that too then you’re our type of person and we’re your type of business,” Houghton adds.

Positive change

Ovo Energy describes itself as a modern company with a moral compass, a positioning it aims to articulate through its focus on renewable power and its approach to gender parity in sport.

Through its charity, the Ovo Foundation, the company aims to improve access to affordable renewable energy in developing countries, tackle youth poverty and help more children access education. Ovo commits to match every donation made to the foundation by its customers.

Houghton believes the brand’s desire to live up to its purpose comes down to the type of people it hires. He explains that attracting and retaining the brightest and most values-driven talent is fundamental to everything the brand achieves.

“Genuinely from day one we have always hired people based on their values. We have three simple values – one is find a way, one is build something great and the third is be the good guys,” says Houghton.

“Everyone who walks through the doors at Ovo is here to do good and therefore the Ovo Foundation or sponsorship or gender parity, these are not add-ons or gimmicks, they are intrinsic to the fact that we are trying to power positive change across the board.”

Since starting out in 2009, Ovo Energy has leveraged its positive change positioning to attract nearly 900,000 customers. The company first emerged on the scene offering a better version of what already existed in terms of improving customer service, answering calls quicker and with greater empathy, as well as providing competitive pricing and transparency.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ItpotxmU8Q

Nine years ago the idea of a company in the energy sector treating customers fairly was a “novel and innovative approach”.

“For a long time energy companies saw customers as a bit of a necessary evil to use the power they were generating. We came on the scene and were looking to put the customer at the heart of everything we do and we were all about being cheaper, greener and simpler,” says Houghton.

“If you roll forward to today there’s about 70 participants in the market, all of them looking fairly undifferentiated, all of them using that cheaper, greener, simpler narrative that we were using in 2009 and they’re all competing on price, which is a race to the bottom.”

Over the past 18 months, Ovo Energy has taken a step back and asked itself what it is trying to achieve for the brand and its customers. While the CEO Stephen Fitzpatrick acknowledges it would be a stretch to call Ovo a new entrant or a small business, the company retains its challenger mentality in terms of not being afraid to go against the status quo.

This mentality has helped the company move in a much more digital direction, developing its own software and providing digital tools for customers to self-serve, as well as investing in automation, data, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

“It isn’t necessarily because we are having to do that, we have a plan. We have a strategy of how we can solve these chunkier issues of providing guilt free energy for people and not many organisations in our industry it would seem have a plan,” says Houghton.

“They’re looking to undercut the prices of their competitors and they don’t really have a strategy for providing longer term security in the energy space or a greener future or longer term affordable and sustainable pricing. We’re pushing the boundaries rather than being pushed.”","Tackling the gender pay gap in sports made perfect sense for a brand focused on hiring values driven people with a strong purpose at its heart, says Ovo Energy CEO Chris Houghton.

Cuba confirms 110 dead in Friday's plane crash, 3 survivors in serious condition

HAVANA - Cuba confirms on Saturday that 110 were dead from Friday's Boeing 737 crash close to Havana's Jose Marti International Airport.

Transportation Minister Adel Yzquierdo told a press conference that of the 110 dead, 99 were Cubans, 11 foreigners including 6 Mexican crew members, 2 Argentines, 1 Mexican and 2 temporary foreign residents.

Up to now, only 15 bodies have been identified, the minister said, adding officials were working intensively to identify the rest of the victims, whose remains were transferred to the Institute of Legal Medicine in Havana.

Yzquierdo said the three survivors of the tragic accident have been identified as Mailen Diaz, 19, Gretell Landrovell, 23, and Emiley Sanchez, 39.

They are receiving specialized medical attention at the Calixto Garcia University Hospital in the capital, and their condition is critical.

One of the plane's two black boxes has been recovered in good condition, specifically the one with the voice recordings, and investigators continue to sift through the rubble for the second one containing flight data, Yzquierdo said.

Representatives of the aircraft's manufacturer are arriving to help in the investigations, as are international experts, to determine what caused the crash.

The aircraft leased by Cubana airlines from the Mexican company Damojh, crashed a little past noon on Friday, minutes after taking off from Terminal 1 of Havana's Jose Marti International Airport.

No Chinese victims in Cuba plane crash

A source from the Chinese Embassy in Cuba told Xinhua that there were no Chinese nationals on board the ill-fated Boeing 737 which crashed Friday during taking off at the Jose Marti International Airport in Havana.

The embassy said this after preliminary communication with the Cuban Foreign Ministry, said the source.

A total of 111 people were on board the aircraft, including 104 passengers and an infant. There were also six crew members of Mexican nationality, according to Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo.

So far, only three women survived the crash, all still in serious condition.

The Cuban government declared two days of mourning from 6:00 am (1000 GMT) on Saturday to Sunday midnight.

The plane, rented by local company Cubana de Aviacion from the Mexican airline Damojh, crashed shortly after taking off from Havana's Jose Marti International Airport on Friday. The plane was a Boeing 737-201 built in 1979, according to a statement issued Friday by the Transport Ministry.

In his statements to local television, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel announced that investigations to clarify the causes of the accident are still in progress.

Two experts would fly to Cuba on Saturday to take part in the investigation, according to Mexican aviation authorities.

Friday's crash was Cuba's third major accident since 2010.

Last year, a Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight soldiers on board.

In November 2010, an AeroCaribbean flight from Santiago to Havana went down as it flew over central Cuba, killing 68 people, including 28 foreigners.","At least three people have been found alive, but in critical condition, after a Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed near Havana on Friday, according to state newspaper Granma.

May 17 will be marked as a red-letter day in Nepal, for seven months after forging an electoral alliance and announcing plans to merge, the CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre were today dissolved to form a unified Nepal Communist Party, giving the country a majority government after decades.

The unified party, which was registered with the Election Commission this afternoon following the dissolution of the two parties, has two co-chairpersons —

KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. It has a nine-member secretariat, 45-member standing committee and 441-member central committee.

Madhav Kumar Nepal is the

senior leader, Narayan Kaji Shrestha spokesperson and Bishnu Poudel general secretary of the NCP. Jhalanath Khanal, Bamdev Gautam, Ram Bahadur Thapa and Ishwar Pokharel have become secretariat members.

In the NCP central committee, 241 members are from the UML and 200 from the CPN-MC.

However, all the central committee members have yet to be finalised, but the UML central committee members and the CPN-MC’s secretariat members signed the unified party’s minute submitted to the Election Commission.

The unified party’s central committee members, who have been finalised so far, took the oath of office and secrecy at Prime Minister Oli’s official residence in Baluwatar before the formal announcement.

With the unification, the central government and provincial governments in six provinces are no longer coalition governments. The NCP now has 174 members in the 275-member House of Representatives, 42 members in the 59-member National Assembly, and has majority in six of the seven provincial assemblies.

“Since the NCP has majority in local, provincial and central governments, the new party will work to formulate policies to attain prosperity,” said Prime Minister Oli addressing an event organised to announce the unification. He added that unification of subordinate committees and sister organisations would be completed within three months.

On public perception over the future of a party with two chairmen, Oli said: “We are not driving a tempo. Flying a jet plane needs two pilots.”

Oli also clarified that the unity was not against anybody, but against poverty, corruption and backwardness. He added that the unification was aimed at realising the goal of sustainable development and upgrading Nepal from its current status of least developed country.

Oli said unification was not a heterogeneous mixture of two parties, but a homogeneous mixture.

Echoing Oli, Dahal said the formation of the NCP after the unification of the UML and CPN-MC was like the formation of water after hydrogen and oxygen are combined.

Stating that the unification heralded a new era of stability and prosperity with social justice in the country, Dahal said, “The newly-formed party is based on the realities of the 21st century, both regional and global.”

Dahal also said that the new party would create a base for socialism.

As per the declaration made public in the same event, the unification is aimed at establishing socialism-oriented society, pursuing foreign relations on the basis of equality, ensuring the government’s effectiveness, realising the goal of development and prosperity and promoting peaceful competition. The declaration adds the NCP is committed to the UN charter, non-aligned movement, and peaceful coexistence.

As per the declaration, the new party will have a common political document on socialism-oriented people’s democracy and will keep ‘people’s multi-party democracy’ and ‘people’s democracy in 21st century’ pending for the first general convention of the unified party. Marxism and Leninism will be the guiding principles of the new party that has sun as its election symbol.

The Party Unification Coordination Committee and respective central committees of the UML and CPN-MC had endorsed the unification deal before dissolving the respective parties earlier in the day.

Road to unification

The unification process between CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre, which appeared to be veering out of track until last week, made a surprising turnaround this week, culminating in a merger of the country’s two biggest left parties. In rapid-fire developments that took place on Thursday, the two parties called a meeting of Party Unification Coordination Committee, finalised the number of central committee members of the unified party, dissolved their existence, formed a new party and initiated the new party’s registration process at the Election Commission. With this, the unification process, which began on October 3, has been completed. The new party has been named Nepal Communist Party. The following are key developments in the run up to unification:

Oct 3 – CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Centre and Naya Shakti Party Nepal sign a six-point deal to form the left alliance to contest provincial and parliamentary elections

Oct 13 – Naya Shakti Party, led by former Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai, quits the alliance over disputes regarding seat sharing in elections

Nov 7 – Leaders of CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre unveil joint election manifesto

Dec 21 – CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli says UML and the Maoist Centre will unify within a couple of days

Feb 15 – Oli becomes the prime minister but the Maoist Centre does not forward names of its members for inclusion in the Cabinet due to differences over power sharing

Feb 19 – CPN-UML and Maoist Centre sign seven-point agreement on modality of unification; agreement states People’s Multiparty Democracy (‘Janata ko Bahudaliya Janawad’ popularly known as Ja-Ba-Ja as propagated by late UML leader Madan Bhandari) and Maoism will be deliberated upon as the ideological lines of the party at the general convention of the unified party

Feb 26 – Members of Maoist Centre join Cabinet

Mar 11 – UML, Maoist Centre may unify on April 22, says Maoist Center leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha

Apr 3 – Two joint task forces are formed to give shape to the merger; parties fail to reach consensus on power-sharing due to Maoists' demand for 50 per cent stake in the new party

Apr 22 – Proposed party merger on Lenin’s birth anniversary fails to take place

Apr 26 – CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal says plots are being hatched to disrupt the unification process

May 12 – Ministers from Maoist Centre boycott civic reception hosted by Kathmandu Metropolitan City in honour of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, exposing rift in left alliance

May 16 – UML and Maoist Centre agree to dissolve their parties on May 17

May 17 – Two parties unify","It has a nine-member secretariat, 45-member standing committee and 441-member central committee.

The Tema Metropolitan Assembly (TMA) has for the past one year stopped issuing and renewing permits for the siting of containers in the Metropolis.

Mr Maxwell Adu Boateng, Tema Metropolitan Works Engineer, disclosing this to the Ghana News Agency said since April 2017, TMA has not issued or renewed permits which allowed residents to site containers and other structures in the area.

Mr Boateng noted that the decision to stop issuing the permit came at the back of abuse of siting of containers in the Metropolis as people indiscriminately put up such structures at unapproved areas.

He said instead of placing them at the markets, most of them put their containers on pavements, grassing, school parks, car parks, and pathways among others.

He announced that as part of the Assembly's restoration agenda, his outfit was embarking on a decongestion exercise targeted at clearing all containers wrongfully sited in all the communities.

The Metropolitan Engineer indicated that his office had posted removal notices on all affected containers giving them an option to either remove them or have them demolished.

According to him, the TMA Works Department would continue to clear the containers no matter the claims of owners that 'they were paying tolls to the Assembly' because the Assembly was not were not aware of any payment.

A number of containers had been demolished in the past three weeks at parts of Tema Community Four including the frontage of the Narh-Bita Nursing College.

Mr Boateng said to ensure that containers cleared from the affected areas did not find themselves in another area, his outfit had resorted to cutting the containers into sheets.","Listen to articleThe Tema Metropolitan Assembly (TMA) has for the past one year stopped issuing and renewing permits for the siting of containers in the Metropolis.

What is more, extreme poverty in Nigeria is growing by six people every minute, while poverty in India continues to fall.”However, the estimates of extreme poverty reduction may not match with Indian numbers because of differences in how poverty is measured. According to the World Bank, between 2004 and 2011 poverty declined in India from 38.9% of the population to 21.2% (2011 purchasing power parity at $1.9 per person per day).Quick Edit: India is still a poor country, Modi government must push more reformsEconomists said the finding of the study supports the argument that rapid economic growth had helped make a dent in extreme poverty. “Basically it supports the growth story and the 1991 economic reforms that have helped reduce poverty,” said N R Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. “Going ahead, the challenge is to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, which will help realise the study’s findings that India would be able to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030,” he said.Bhanumurthy said the assumption that India would be able to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 seems realistic given the country’s record in the past 10 years in reducing poverty and its ability to meet the Millennium Development Goals. “But to achieve that we must continue to grow at 7%-8% for the remaining period,” he said. The UN-sponsored Sustainable Development Goals aim to eliminate global poverty by 2030.The benchmark projections of poverty by country imply a high speed of poverty reduction in South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, fuelled by the high rates of income per capita growth in India, Indonesia , Bangladesh, the Philippines , China and Pakistan , the study says. It showed global income increases in the last decades have led to systematic decreases in poverty rates worldwide, with the experience in India and China having played the most important role when it comes to the overall number of persons escaping absolute poverty.At the heart of the study is the World Poverty Clock. It takes into account household surveys and projections of economic growth from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. These form the basic building blocks for poverty trajectories computed for 188 countries.

The study model estimated that on September 1, 2017, 647 million people lived in extreme poverty. “Every minute 70 people escape poverty (or 1.2 people per second).

By the end of 2018 in Africa as a whole, there will probably be about 3.2 million more people living in extreme poverty than at present

NEW DELHI: With persistent decline in poverty, India is no longer a nation having largest number of poor people in the world, says a study published by US based think tank Brookings .

The study, titled ' The start of a new poverty narrative ' and published in the Brookings' blog, is authored by Homi Kharas, Kristofer Hamel and Martin Hofer.

According to the study, Nigeria has already overtaken India as the country with the largest number of extreme poor in early 2018, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo could soon take over the number 2 spot.

""At the end of May 2018, our trajectories suggest that Nigeria had about 87 million people in extreme poverty, compared with India's 73 million.

""What is more, extreme poverty in Nigeria is growing by six people every minute, while poverty in India continues to fall,"" said the study.

It further pointed out that by the end of 2018 in Africa as a whole, there will probably be about 3.2 million more people living in extreme poverty than at present.

Noting that about 725 million people were in extreme poverty at the beginning of 2016, the report said, ""we needed to reduce poverty by 1.5 people every second to achieve the goal and yet we have been moving at a pace of only 1.1 people per second"".

""As we fall further behind the target pace, the task of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is becoming inexorably harder because we are running out of time,"" it added.

The UN-sponsored Sustainable Development Goals aim to eliminate global poverty by 2030.

Commenting on the study, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) member Shamika Ravi said that India has achieved a rapid decline in extreme poverty through high development spending and high growth.

The study has cited data from World Poverty Clock and new projections on country economic growth from the International Monetary Funds' World Economic Outlook.

These form the basic building blocks for poverty trajectories computed for 188 countries and territories, developed and developing, across the world.

Many Palestinian camp dwellers in Lebanon feel apathetic, depressed and hopeless about their future. They often end up using drugs or joining armed groups within the camps, according to a study commissioned by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the UN agency caring for Palestinian refugees, and the United Nationals Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

The socio-economic and political conditions of Palestinians in Lebanon have a major impact on young people’s lives and aspirations. Lack of civil rights, unemployment, insecurity and dire conditions in camps limit their opportunities and hopes for education, affect their health and trap them in hopeless situations, said the study conducted by the Centre for Lebanese Studies (CLS) released in early May.

“The study’s objective is to assess the living conditions, health, economics, education, security, mobility, as well as psychological well-being of Palestinian youth 10-24 of age,” said Maha Shuayb, the centre’s director. “It includes Palestinians born in Lebanon and those who came from Syria, fleeing the conflict there.”

The assessment was carried out between February and May 2017 and involved face-to-face interviews with 958 Palestinian refugees from Lebanon (PRL) and 102 Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS) in eight camps across Lebanon. The sample also included group discussions with 119 Palestinian youth and caretakers such as parents and school officials.

Findings show that more than 70% of PRL live in poverty and 5% in extreme poverty ($75 per person per month) while 90% of PRS live in poverty and more than 10% in extreme poverty.

Housing conditions were among the top complaints with 89% of respondents describing their housing as extremely wet and poor. Some 50% had to move houses at least twice, the most common reason being that they could not afford the rent.

Economic conditions were respondents’ top complaint, notably difficulties finding jobs, Shuayb noted. “More than 40% of PRS and PRL have difficulties paying the bills for essential goods and services, such as electricity and food. Some 20% were working full time, more than 20% unemployed and 11% were unemployed but not looking for a job. Among those who are working, 50% earned little compared to the long working hours they do,” she said.

“However, the interesting finding in this study compared to a previous one conducted in 2009 was the youth emphasis on civil rights,” Shuayb said. “No such awareness existed before. Now they are more aware and they really want to do something about it, their right to work and own property.”

Palestinian refugees are barred from owning property in Lebanon and working in most sectors. Since 2005 they have been granted the right to practise about 70 professions that were previously restricted to Lebanese nationals. However, they are still prohibited from working in key professions, including all medical jobs, engineering and law.

Security and mobility were also major concerns for Palestinian youth, who are more likely not to intentionally leave the camp for fear of being stopped at Lebanese Army checkpoints at the entrances of camps. That is particularly true for PRS youth who lack legal residency permits.

The study served as a guideline for UNRWA in devising a Palestinian youth strategy aimed at increasing access to education services, job creation initiatives and empowerment by using the latest technologies.

“We are more than aware today of the importance of devising a strategy that targets the young Palestinians in Lebanon and introduce a positive change to their situation,” said Abdelnasser al-Ayali, representing the Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee, a consultative body advising the government on improving the living conditions of Palestinians.

“We need to change our traditional approach to dealing with the issue of Palestinian presence in Lebanon. The most important thing is to create a political will in order to implement any serious strategy for the youth who have long been marginalised,” al-Ayali said.

“We believe that constructive political dialogue would reduce the fears and concerns of the Lebanese. This is a key to changing the situation of the Palestinians and this is what we are working on as a committee,” he added.

The Lebanese government is strongly opposed to the resettling of the mostly Sunni Muslim Palestinian refugees who played a controversial role in the country’s civil war from 1975 to 1990. More than 450,000 refugees are officially registered with UNRWA in Lebanon but the real number is believed to be less than half that, as many have either died or relocated.","BEIRUT - With difficult access to good education and health services, economic marginalisation and restrictions on employment, Palestinian youth are the most affected by refugees’ harsh living conditions in Lebanon.

Said the writer Brian Phillips, in a tweet that has now been retweeted and favorited several thousand times, “Isn’t this also a natural consequence of the fact that millennials are now 35[?]”

He was kind of joking, but it’s a good point: A lot of millennials are in their mid-to-late 30s now, which means that the media’s default image of us is about as age appropriate as a too-small crop top. Although the cutoff points for generations are always in dispute, most research defines a millennial as someone who was born after 1980 and before 2000. Earlier this year, though, Pew Research Center officially decided, “for a number of reasons, including key political, economic, and social factors,” to draw a line at the birth year of 1996. That means that according to Pew, the oldest millennials will turn 37 this year; the very youngest will turn 22, the age many undergraduates are when they graduate from college and (you know, God willing) enter the workforce. And so the old stereotype of un-PC-professor-protesting, avocado-bingeing, Applebee’s-agnostic kids is in need of an update. As painful as it is for me, a 31-year-old Old Millennial, to admit, we’re not that young anymore.

“Soon ‘millennial’ won’t refer to those rascally kids with their phones,” writes Malcolm Harris in his 2017 book Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials. “It will be a dominant character of a new America.” He’s right, and that shift is happening before our eyes—especially in the wake of the sudden visibility of Generation Z (or whatever they decide to call themselves) and their widespread activism after the Parkland shooting. The poise and purpose that so many teens have shown in the past year has been inspiring, but it’s also a reminder of a new millennial identity crisis. When we’re no longer able to be stereotyped as lazy, entitled, iPhone-lobotomized kids, how, exactly, will we be seen? What will we be known for? What happens when a generation infamous for its anxiety about “adulting” starts approaching (gulp) middle age?

Earlier this year, I was astonished—maybe more than I should have been—to hear a 17-year-old I know use the word “millennial” to mean someone significantly older than she is. Because this particular 17-year-old is incredibly wise, I asked her to describe what she thinks of when she thinks of the word “millennial.” After the requisite jokes about avocados and chain restaurants, she considered the question more deeply. “Maybe this is stupid,” she said, “but the first thing that comes to mind is, like … Glossier. That whole clean, minimalist advertising aesthetic. People wanting to make life less messy, and make life ‘easier’ … but only really for their generation and people like them.” (The teens! They are wise and will save us all.)

Her characterization didn’t shock me, but it did bum me out. I want to believe that there is a spirit of radicalism and revolution to my cohort, but how radical can we be when the name we’re called just conjures another advertising aesthetic—a modern, streamlined way of selling us stuff? Hoping she’d be equally cynical toward her own cohort, I asked her—a member of what she called with a crinkled-up nose “Generation Z, I guess”—how she saw her own peer group. She painted it in contrast to the image she’d just described: messy, hodgepodge, “putting all kinds of styles together that don’t really match.” She shrugged, reluctant to box herself in too much. I might have done the same thing when I was 17. I wondered how much any of this has to do with generations, and how much of it is simply the way you see yourself and the people older than you when you’re young.

In their influential tome Generations, the sociologists William Strauss and Neil Howe liken each particular generational cohort to a train. “Picture one long lifecycle track,” they write, “with birth the place of origin and death the destination.” It’s bleak, yes, but it’s a clear way to envision the differences between generational identities and life-cycle markers. Phases of maturity, like childhood, midlife, and elderhood, are different stations. “Now picture a series of generational trains,” they write, “all heading down the track at the same speed. … If we picture ourselves sitting at any given station watching one train go and another arrive, we notice how different each train looks from the next.”

If you think of it this way, our generational experience is a little bit about the train and a little bit about the station. That conversation with my wise Gen Z-er made me consider what people might have said about “millennials” when I was 17, back in 2004. The truth is, most of the things we now consider quintessentially “millennial” did not even exist then. Mark Zuckerberg was, at that moment, a nerdy unknown kid at Harvard; Barack Obama was a little-known junior senator from Illinois whom most people would first hear of that July, when he spoke at the Democratic National Convention. I didn’t have a smartphone when I was 17; the iPhone wouldn’t exist for another three years. The housing market and the job market seemed … fine. Or at least it seemed as though they would exist in some reliable way when I was old enough to need them. In other words, I trusted the train would make its scheduled stops.

My resistance to thinking about what “millennial” means when it’s no longer a synonym for “young person” is of course related to my fear of aging and inevitable death (who can relate?!). But I think it’s also a method of avoidance. Because all the other things that define us—massive student loan debt, the juvenilization of poverty, uncertainty about the environment and retirement and capitalism and democracy and and and … feel pretty catastrophic.

Last December, 35-year-old Michael Hobbes published a long, thoroughly researched Huffington Post article titled “Millennials Are Screwed.” “What is different about us as individuals compared to previous generations is minor,” he wrote. “What is different about the world around us is profound. Salaries have stagnated and entire sectors have cratered. At the same time, the cost of every prerequisite of a secure existence—education, housing and health care—has inflated into the stratosphere. From job security to the social safety net, all the structures that insulate us from ruin are eroding. And the opportunities leading to a middle-class life—the ones that boomers lucked into—are being lifted out of reach.”

Malcolm Harris’s book paints a similarly bleak landscape. He describes us (and himself—his book cheekily notes on its cover that he was born in 1988) as a generation engineered from birth to be efficient workers, cogs in a labor market that would be more competitive and depleted than ever by the time we reached adulthood. Both authors note the strange, pervasive tendency of our elders to blame millennials for the broken system we were born into. “Participation trophies have become a symbol for generational weakness,” Harris writes in Kids These Days, “but no AYSO-playing Millennial fourth grader ever owned a trophy factory—we’re not giving trophies to ourselves.”

The 2008 recession (for which Hobbes suggests a new, millennial-friendly term I quite like: “the Great Fuckening”) was, in many ways, the defining event for most American millennials. At least if you found yourself on a particular end of it. Hobbes cites an eye-popping statistic: “In 2007, more than 50 percent of college graduates had a job offer lined up. For the class of 2009, fewer than 20 percent of them did.” (I am in the majority of that latter group: I was unemployed for six months after I graduated college in the cursed year of 2009. The full-time job I finally found was at a bakery, which kept promising they’d eventually give me health insurance, but never did.)

Perhaps the great irony of labeling millennials the “entitled” generation, Harris notes, is the fact that (according to a 2014 Pew study) only 6 percent of millennials believe they will receive full Social Security benefits, and 51 percent believe they will not see any Social Security benefits at all. “Think about that for a moment,” Harris writes. “The average dual-earner couple will pay over a million dollars in taxes into a system that more than half of Millennials think will leave them high and dry. … [T]he so-called entitled generation doesn’t even feel entitled to our own entitlements.”

Maybe we’ve been so distracted by our millennial-pink aesthetics and avocado punch lines because it’s too depressing to think of what defines us on a deeper level. Uncertainty. Collapse. The feeling that we’re cosmically screwed.

As difficult as it is to read statistic after statistic telling us how fucked we are—how we will be statistically worse off than our parents, that we’ll have to work well past a reasonable retirement age, how we’ll never afford to own a home—we need to diagnose these problems before we can know how to treat them. Which just might be something we can do as we approach this next stage of life. As that infernal southbound train rounds the track toward the Midlife station, the good news is that millennials will soon become the country’s dominant demographic. We’re already starting to elect the first wave of millennial politicians. We’ll soon be the largest voting bloc in the country. Ideally, that means we’ll be able to engineer and support the kinds of policies that can help us most. Finally—a productive use of our narcissism.

If just thinking about all of this triggers an impending midlife crisis, the sprouting of some gray hairs, or a sudden need for adult diapers—fear not. I’m sure there’ll be apps for all that soon.","And so the old stereotype of un-PC-professor-protesting, avocado-bingeing, Applebee’s-agnostic kids is in need of an update.

THE EDITOR: Today, the world observes the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The World Drug Report 2017 states that 29.5 million people globally suffer from drug use disorders, including dependence.

“The report finds that hepatitis C is causing the greatest harm among the estimated 12 million people who inject drugs worldwide ... Mobile communications offers new opportunities to traffickers, while the darknet allows users to anonymously buy drugs with a crypto-currency, such as bitcoin ... Typical buyers are recreational users of cannabis, ‘ecstasy,’ cocaine, hallucinogens and new psychoactive substances ...

“The spectrum of substances available on the drug market has widened considerably ... The opioid market in particular is becoming more diversified, with a combination of internationally controlled substances like heroin, and prescription medicines that are either diverted from the legal market or produced as counterfeit medicines.”

The report makes it clear that corruption, the illicit drug trade and poverty reinforce each other: “The wealth and power of some drug trafficking organisations can exceed that of local governments, allowing them to buy protection from law enforcement agents, criminal justice institutions, politicians and the business sector. In doing so, they further reinforce corruption. The rule of law is both an immediate victim and, if it is already weak, an underlying factor that feeds this cycle.”

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) states that “drug trafficking is a global illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of substances which are subject to drug prohibition laws.”

Executive director Yury Fedotov of the UNODC says: “Drugs continue to represent a major source of revenue for organised crime networks, but business models are changing, with criminals exploiting new technologies, such as the darknet, that are altering the nature of the illicit drug trade and the types of players involved, with looser, horizontal networks and smaller groups becoming more significant.

“New ways of delivering drugs further point to the need to involve other sectors such as postal services in the fight against drug trafficking ... The many evolving drug challenges also highlight the importance of prevention ... but also prevention of crime, corruption, terrorism and violent extremism.”

We should take this issue more seriously and act to save our nation. The US Department 2017 Report on TT: Crime and Safety Report states: “Drug trafficking and gang-related activities continue to fuel the demand for illegal weapons ... In Trinidad, the majority of violent crimes ... are gang/drug-related or domestic in nature.

“A significant, growing portion is attributed to the influence of gangs, illegal narcotics, and firearms ... Trinidad is a major transshipment point for illicit drugs, and drug-related crimes are a significant contributor to crime.”

The report also notes the weaknesses in our border control.

Pope Francis continues to speak out against “the scourge of drug trafficking” and its effects: “The scourge of drug trafficking, which favours violence and sows the seeds of suffering and death, requires of society as a whole an act of courage ... Drug addiction is an evil, and with evil there can be no yielding or compromise ...

“Drug trafficking is, by its very nature, accompanied by trafficking in persons, money laundering, the arms trade, child exploitation and other forms of corruption. A corruption which has penetrated to different levels of social, political, military, artistic and religious life, and, in many cases, has given rise to a parallel structure which threatens the credibility of our institutions.”

Parents, recognise the signs and symptoms of addiction. Parishes can help too. Pastoral care is important, eg Living Water offers drug rehabilitation ministries (tel: 625-6730).

“As people of faith we are called to share our hope and love with those whose lives are already wounded by this epidemic” (US bishops). Let us help them to create “new lives.”

On 1 July, the Mexican people will vote in possibly the most important presidential election in their country’s recent history.

The crisis of credibility suffered by the current administration and traditional political parties in the past few years has led to increased popular support for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), a 65-year-old politician from the state of Tabasco who served as mayor of Mexico City between 2000 and 2005 and unsuccessfully ran for president in the 2006 and 2012 elections .

AMLO is supported by a coalition named “Together We Will Make History”, consisting of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena) – the party that AMLO founded following his loss in the 2012 election – and two other minor parties: the left-wing Worker’s Party and the right-wing Social Encounter Party, which has been linked to the evangelical movement.

At the moment, the most reliable polls agree that AMLO will win by a landslide. In fact, voter turnout is expected to reach 65 percent, significantly increasing the likelihood of an AMLO victory, as high voter participation limits the ability of local “vote lords” to alter electoral results in favour of the traditional parties.

An AMLO victory would shake the foundations of the Mexican political system as we know it. From 1929 to 2000, Mexico was governed by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

The new millennium ushered in a brief period of bipolar politics, with the PRI and the National Action Party (PAN) alternating periods in power. Now Morena, a relatively young political party with little structure compared to the bloated PRI, threatens to defeat and replace not only the traditional political parties, but also the consolidated power groups behind them.

The biggest concern regarding a possible AMLO victory is his populist discourse. In fact, many fear that AMLO will turn out to be a Mexican Hugo Chavez . This implies that AMLO is, if not Marxist, at least a radical leftist, which is not the case.

AMLO is not a socialist

AMLO is definitely a populist, but he is not a left-wing radical. His catchy political narrative is based on creating opposition between honest citizens and dishonest politicians (which he calls the “power mafia“), but his discourse does not reference labour issues, class struggle, US imperialism, or financial capitalism at all.

{articleGUID}

Even considering that socialism and Marxism in Latin America have evolved into a number of un-orthodox offshoots and variants, AMLO’s political narrative hardly matches any of his Latin American left-wing peers. In fact, AMLO cooperated fruitfully with the local private sector during his tenure as mayor of Mexico City, achieving significant and long-lasting results, including the rehabilitation of Mexico City’s historic centre.

So why do people believe that AMLO is a socialist in spite of both the evidence and his own political discourse?

In order to understand the origin of this misunderstanding, one must look back to 2006, when AMLO ran against Felipe Calderon in the Mexican presidential elections. At the time, the Calderon campaign portrayed AMLO as a populist, an enemy of the private sector and of the wealthy.

This narrative helped Calderon win the presidency that year, but it eventually became AMLO’s strongest strategic advantage and the very reason why the lower classes now overwhelmingly support him.

If AMLO is elected president, what kind of policies will he implement? The biggest fear of the Mexican private sector is that AMLO will embark on a Venezuela-style nationalisation spree, but that is actually quite unlikely.

First of all, nationalisation is neither a part of Morena’s platform – which explicitly mentions incentives to increase competition in several sectors – nor a part of AMLO’s political narrative. And second, nationalisations in Mexico are highly impractical and represent a huge political risk, as they would most likely devolve into corruption scandals.

Moreover, AMLO’s candidacy is supported by neoliberal economists that have worked at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, including Gerardo Esquivel and Jesus Seade, among others.

Economist Carlos Manuel Urzua, who is expected to become AMLO’s finance minister, has taken a position in favour of economic competition and the private sector. As such, it is unlikely that AMLO will adopt revolutionary economic policies.

AMLO’s policies will not radically eliminate poverty and corruption

The core of AMLO’s political economy policies will likely involve the reinforcement of existing social programmes like “Piso Firme” and “ Vivienda Digna“, which distribute construction materials to low-income populations to ensure that they are able to access fair housing.

In addition, AMLO also proposes providing financial support to women and the elderly. It is important to keep in mind that in several areas of Mexico, more than 90 percent of the population lives in poverty.

These social support policies are necessary, as they allow this marginalised population to access basic services. However, they will hardly affect social mobility, which is currently extremely limited.

The only way to integrate the marginalised portion of the Mexican population into society is through education; however, in the last few decades, the Mexican education system has been held hostage by two self-governed trade unions that are unaccountable to voters and the government: the National Coordinator of Education Workers (CNTE) and the National Education Workers Union (SNTE).

These unions have thwarted all attempts to reform the dysfunctional mechanisms currently in place to train and hire academic staff. AMLO and CNTE are strategic electoral allies, and it is highly unlikely that he will be able to radically reform the system.

The war on corruption is at the core of AMLO’s campaign. He and his team perceive and present the eradication of corruption as a measure of development. AMLO’s platform proposes reinforcing and centralising controls on public expenditure in an effort to reduce corruption in public tenders, with the recovered resources subsequently being invested into social programmes.

Although this measure is likely to succeed, it would only tackle high-level corruption and would leave the systemic corruption in the public administration largely unaddressed. Corruption is a widespread phenomenon at every level of Mexican bureaucracy, and corruption at the lowest levels – police, universities, hospitals, city administrations, etc – constitutes quite possibly the most significant burden on the domestic market.

Corruption is rampant in Mexico primarily because of high levels of impunity – 69.21 percent according to the Global Impunity Index – and the only way to truly address it is by reforming the judicial system, which does not seem to be a part of AMLO’s plan. Without specific, targeted measures, it is unlikely that corruption will decrease and development indicators will improve.

The risk of political fragmentation and deadlock under AMLO

What are the chances that AMLO will actually implement his platform? Well, much depends on the size of AMLO’s victory. Should AMLO win the presidency, but not a majority of the seats in parliament, an unprecedented institutional stall with unforeseeable implications would likely occur. If AMLO wins and his party takes 35 – 40 percent of the seats in both chambers, Morena and its coalition forces will face two major problems. The first one is in-party negotiations. AMLO has brought together a diverse base, including right-wing conservatives and progressive forces. This unlikely coalition is an effective electoral tool that will allow AMLO to win votes from diverse social and economic backgrounds, but it could easily splinter should it rise to power. AMLO has undeniable charisma, which will help him impose, to some extent, unpopular decisions, however, it will be impossible for him to satisfy the interests of all members of his party and coalition. As a result, Morena runs the risk of internal fragmentation, possibly resulting in splinter factions deciding to create their own parties or power groups.

This is new territory for Mexican politics. Moreover, this internal weakness can also create an additional problem. If AMLO does not secure the support of a cohesive coalition, he will have little leverage to negotiate policies with other parties, potentially stalling the implementation of the proposed reforms and causing institutional deadlock.

The other scenario is that AMLO wins the presidency with 50 percent or more of the votes. Should this occur, he will face a weak opposition, which would likely ease the implementation of his policies. However, the risk of internal fragmentation would remain, as AMLO’s charisma might not be enough to keep the coalition united and could actually further frustrate sub-groups in Morena that are unhappy with his policies. No matter the outcome of the election, AMLO’s leadership will likely face challenges from his own coalition.

AMLO’s policies will not jeopardise Mexico’s economy or society. However, a paralysis of the political system is very much possible. The stall of political negotiations could lead to stalled reforms, which is exactly what Mexico must avoid.

Although a better allocation of resources could lead to growth and improved macro-economic performance in the short and medium term, the problem of chronic underdevelopment will remain as long as the education system, justice system, public administration, and law enforcement do not undergo significant overhauls and improvements.

“If AMLO can’t do it, nobody can” reads the slogan of his campaign.

And it might be true – AMLO might be the most tenable presidential candidate to address current social forces. However, probable infighting among his coalition will likely limit his margin of manoeuvre, potentially leading him to water down his policies in an attempt to seek consensus among traditional power groups.

An AMLO victory will augur neither the beginning of a revolution nor the complete overhaul of the existing system, but will instead represent access to political power for a number of historically underrepresented social actors.

It is difficult to foresee if the next six years will be a success or a failure. The only sure thing is that we are heading towards a brand-new phase of Mexican politics marked by a change in the country’s political actors, as well as the socioeconomic forces behind them.

The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.","An AMLO victory would shake the foundations of the Mexican political system as we know it.
This implies that AMLO is, if not Marxist, at least a radical leftist, which is not the case.
So why do people believe that AMLO is a socialist in spite of both the evidence and his own political discourse?
AMLO’s policies will not jeopardise Mexico’s economy or society.
And it might be true – AMLO might be the most tenable presidential candidate to address current social forces."

The Myanmar government has restricted access to the northern Rakhine townships of Maungdaw, Buithdaung, and Rathedaung, where the military conducted a campaign of terror against Rohingya civilians that included killings, torture, rape, and arson, and so far has only permitted small groups of journalists on state-sponsored trips to the region.

“Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said the military has placed no restrictions on media access in Rakhine state, but he doesn’t know if the government has some in place,” said Myint Kyaw, a member of the Myanmar Press Council (MPC), an independent organization comprised of privately owned media representatives that investigates and settles press disputes and protects media workers in Myanmar.

“We suggested to him that the military should announce officially that there are no restrictions on media access in Rakhine state,” he said.

During a meeting between Min Aung Hlaing and the MPC, Myint Kyaw also suggested that the military chief maintain and improve the relationship between the media and the armed forces.

The senior general accepted the advice and acknowledged that there had been some misunderstandings between the military and journalists, Myint Kyaw said, though he gave MPC members only an email address for the military information committee to contact, but not a phone number.

Min Aung Hlaing also told reporters at a news conference held in his office in the capital that the relationship between the military and the ruling national League for Democracy (NLD) party is good, and that he has no intention of responding to a damning report by London-based rights group Amnesty International.

Amnesty put Min Aung Hlaing at the top of a list of 13 military and border guard officers it said should be tried for crimes against humanity for their leading roles in a ""highly orchestrated, systematic attack on the Rohingya population"" in 2017.

Reporting delegation in Rakhine

Myanmar’s official Global New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday that a group of 18 domestic and foreign journalists arrived in Rakhine’s capital Sittwe on Wednesday to report on the situation in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships.

The delegation includes reporters from Radio Free Asia, Japan’s Kyodo news agency, China’s Xinhua news agency, The Wall Street Journal, BBC, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Frontier Myanmar, Myanmar International Television, and Myanmar Radio and Television.

The journalists will visit villages in Maungdaw to cover stability, security, and development issues and the planned repatriation of Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh during the turmoil, the report said.

The Myanmar government, however, continues to prevent independent media outlets from visiting the region on trips not arranged by the state.

Most officials offer blanket denials that any atrocities were committed in Rakhine, with some even claiming that Rohingya refugees who fled burned-out villages last year had set their own homes on fire.

In Bangladesh, meanwhile, media outlets from around the world have interviewed Rohingya refugees and aid groups and produced detailed reports on the scorched-earth Myanmar army campaign that chased the Muslim minority across the border.

Two Reuters reporters covering the atrocities have been detained in Myanmar since December 2017 and are currently attending pretrial hearings on charges of possessing state secrets. One police witness testified that they were set up in a sting operation where officers arranged a meeting with them and handed over documents related to the massacre of 10 Rohingya men in northern Rakhine.

After six months of pretrial hearings, the court will hear arguments from both sides on July 2 on whether the two reporters should be charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in what has become a landmark press freedom case. They face up to 14 years in prison if found guilty.

The commander-in-chief’s comments came a day after President Win Myint’s office denied an opinion piece in a Thai newspaper that said Min Aung Hlaing had threatened to stage a coup over a disagreement with the government about the composition of a new inquiry commission to look into human rights violations that occurred during the crackdown.

His comments also came a day after Amnesty’s report which said that Min Aung Hlaing and 12 other military and border guard officers should be tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their roles in the violence against the Rohingya.

On Monday, Min Aung Hlaing’s office said it dismissed two generals involved in the crackdown, hours after the European Union and Canada imposed sanctions on two of those generals and five other army and border police officials.

On Wednesday, Yanghee Lee, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told the body’s Human Rights Council that the Myanmar government must stop systematic discrimination against the Rohingya, whom Myanmar views as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and grant them citizenship rights.

“It is paramount that the Myanmar government dismantle the system of discrimination against the Rohingya by law, policy, and practice that continues to exist, and guarantee fundamental human rights to them, including by restoring their citizenship rights and property,” she said.

Though Myanmar and Bangladesh have agreed to repatriate some of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, the U.N. and rights groups continue to express concern about their well-being once they return to Rakhine.

“The refugees’ return to Myanmar must occur in full respect of the norms and standards of international refugee law and international human rights law,” Lee told the Council.

“I emphasize that no return should take place unless the conditions in Rakhine state, indeed across the country, are truly safe, enable returnees to enjoy their rights, services are accessible for all, and freedom of movement is guaranteed,” she said.

Lee also urged the Council to set up an international accountability mechanism under its auspices to investigate and prosecute at the ICC those responsible for human rights crimes that have occurred for decades throughout the country.

“I firmly believe that accountability for the crimes committed is the only way to end the cycles of violence faced by the people of Myanmar,” she said, according to a news release.

“I strongly recommend [that] the persons allegedly responsible for the violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law be investigated and prosecuted by the ICC or a credible mechanism,” she said.

Myanmar’s government informed Lee in December that it would no longer cooperate with her or allow her into the country for periodic visits for the remainder of her tenure, accusing her of being biased and unfair in her evaluation of the situation in Rakhine.

Lee will visit Bangladesh from June 29 to July 8 to meet with U.N. and Bangladeshi government officials in the capital Dhaka and travel to Cox’s Bazar district in the southeast, where the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are living in sprawling displacement camps, the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights said in a statement issued Thursday.

Mixed reactions to Lee's call

Activists and lawmakers inside Myanmar had mixed reactions to Lee’s call for human rights violations to be brought before the ICC.

“We've had human rights violations for decades, and only one group — the military — has committed them,” said human rights activist Cheery Zahau.

“The Myanmar military hasn’t adhered to any international or U.N. rules and laws on human rights since after World War II,” she said.

“The Rohingya problem is the biggest proof,” she said. “If we want to stop the military’s human right violations, we have to do something to this institution. It might be through the ICC or other international accountability mechanism,” she said.

Maung Maung Ohn, a former army general and ex-chief minister of Rakhine state who is now a lawmaker representing Ann Township in the state parliament, echoed the government’s position that Lee favors the Rohingya, whom he referred to by the derogatory term Bengalis.

“We don’t care whether Yanghee Lee calls for the prosecution of Myanmar at the ICC or any other place,” he told RFA’s Myanmar Service.

“I told her and other international organizations when I met them as Rakhine state’s chief minister that they are talking only about the Bengalis, and I asked them to consider other ethnic groups in Rakhine,” he said. “There are many other ethnic people who are suffering from poverty and are without health care, education, and social welfare.”

The Rohingya don’t have to work because they receive support from international organizations, whereas other ethnic groups “have to struggle very hard to survive,” Maung Maung Ohn said.

“I told them that we need to balance the handling of this issue with stability, development, and human rights,” he said. “It’s a question of whether she [Lee] has sympathy only for the Bengalis and not other Rakhine ethnic groups.”

“I respect Yanghee Lee personally, but she doesn’t understand our country, people, and situation. Therefore, we don’t need to try to understand her efforts,” he said.

Khon Ja from the Kachin Peace Network pointed out that Kachin civil society organizations called in April for Myanmar to be referred to ICC for what they say are human rights violations against civilians and the denial of humanitarian assistance by soldiers in northern Myanmar’s Kachin state.

Since 2011, more than 100,000 people have been displaced by hostilities between the Myanmar army and an ethnic militia in the war-torn state.

“We think this is appropriate because the military has been violating human rights for generations,” she said.

“It is like we have to ignore and forgive the Myanmar military for whatever it does because Myanmar hasn’t signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,” Khon Ja said, referring to the treaty that established the tribunal in 2002, and to which Myanmar is not a party.

“It is like encouraging it to commit more abuses,” she said.

ICRC to boost aid in Rakhine

Meanwhile, Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), wrapped up a three-day visit to northern Rakhine state where he pledged to increase the group's humanitarian aid to the region and distribute twice the quantity of food it has supplied there since the August 2017 crackdown, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported on Thursday.

When Maurer met with representatives from local civil society organizations and residents in Sittwe to learn more about the on-the-ground situation in the state, they told him that nearly all aid from the ICRC is directed to Muslims.

“We requested that he help and support not only Bengalis, but also Rakhine, Mro, Kaman, Thet, and other ethnics who live in Rakhine state,” said Khine Kaung Zan, executive director of the Wun Let Development Foundation.

Tun Aung Kyaw, general secretary of the Arakan National Party, the region’s dominant political party which represents the interests of mainly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine people, said he told Maurer that everyone in multicultural Rakhine state suffers from poverty.

“To alleviate this suffering, we need development in the region,” he told RFA. “To work on development projects, it would be better if the international community supported the Myanmar government.”

Maurer will meet President Win Myint, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and Min Aung Hlaing on Friday in Naypyidaw before heading to Bangladesh on Saturday for talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed, Home Affairs Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali.

Maurer will also visit Rohingya refugee camps in southeastern Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district to observe the ICRC’s work there.

It seems our world is an increasingly stressful place – and the numbers of people suffering from mental health issues are increasing as a result. While the anxieties of studying are having adverse effects on teens, the pressures of the workplace are impacting adults.

Mental health disorders cost the global economy $1 trillion in lost productivity a year, with depression being the leading cause of ill health and disability, according to the World Health Organization.

More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression, an increase of more than 18% between 2005 and 2015. Meanwhile, 260 million people suffer from anxiety disorders. Many live with both conditions.

Diagnoses of major depression in the U.S. have risen by 33% since 2013, according to US insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS). And this is rising even faster among millennials (up 47%) and adolescents (an increase of 47% for boys and 65% for girls).","This article is brought to you thanks to the strategic cooperation of The European Sting with the World Economic Forum.

Under the New Direction, the National Grand Coalition party promises to tell truth to power and ensure the rule of law from the bedrock of good governance.

Parliamentary Leader of the National Grand Coalition Party (NGC), Hon. Dr. Kandeh Kolleh Yumkella, yesterday, responded to His Excellency President Julius Maada Bio’s parliamentary address delivered on 10 May 2018, on the occasion of the State Opening of the First Session of the Fifth Parliament of the Second Republic of Sierra Leone.

Addressing Members of Parliament at the Tower Hill Chamber in Freetown, the Samu Chiefdom (Constituency 062) Representative commended President Bio’s address for his ambitious vision for Sierra Leone given the enormous challenges he inherited on assumption of office.

President Bio, Hon. Yumkella noted, has in his parliamentary address, “substantiated the need for urgent action by citing credible data from various multilateral institutions; and has used indicators from globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 to clearly illustrate the low level of human development in our country and to elucidate the constraints on economic growth and structural change.”

According to the Kychom-born Member of Parliament, the structural constraints impeding Sierra Leone’s growth and development are the results of bad governance exacerbated by succeeding governments over several decades.

“I wish to hastily say that my intervention is not intended to cast blame, nor will it heap praise; my purpose is to add to the sense of urgency highlighted in the President’s speech and to also provide some reality check to manage our people’s expectations. Since the problems we have inherited were created over decades, there can be no quick fixes and solutions must be pursued persistently over time,” said Hon. Yumkella.

Cognizant that not much time is allotted in parliament for party leaders to fully debate the President’s speech, and in line with his altruistic nature as well as his party’s vision to put “Country First,” Leader Yumkella intimated that “the National Grand Coalition Party(NGC), will send detailed comments and suggestions on the President’s speech, sector by sector, to the Government and the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) for their consideration.”

Such contributions, the party hopes, will expand the debate to the public at large and allow the NGC to make clear its position on the record as a responsible and constructive opposition party.

“Do not feel compelled to defend what has not worked well over the past two decades; do not be defensive or become too partisan,” Hon. Yumkella said to Members of Parliament as he encouraged them to “feel free to provide constructive criticism and accept new and innovative ideas for the sake of our nation. “LEH WE PUT SALONE FOS,” he underscored.

A distinguished Development Economist with over twenty-five years of international experience, Hon. Yumkella fully understands that development is an incremental and cumulative process.

“The New Direction must build on past efforts; scaling up what was good and effective, but radically changing that which must be changed,” he stressed as he called on colleagues from all parties to cooperate with the government of the day to ensure that “Paopa Salone For Betteh“.

While the New Direction agenda of the Sierra Leone Peoples Party has, as its mantra, Disciplined Leadership, Integrity, Efficiency, Professionalism and Delivery, Hon. Yumkella noted that the NGC, as one of the new opposition parties in a new parliament where eighty-five percent of Members are new will “tell truth to power, shine a light on vile corruption, and making sure that constitutionality and the rule of law form the bed rock of governance under the New Direction.

This year’s WED was marked with the theme “Beat Plastic Pollution”, encouraging people to consider: “If you can’t reuse it, refuse it.” An environment is a common place for all living creatures. But human activities are degrading it. The world is getting hotter and hotter by the day due to global warming and climate change. Climatic zones are shifting. Glaciers are melting rapidly.

We are facing some serious environmental issues. Nepal also has been the victim of climate change and global warming. Many years ago our mountains, including Macchapuchhre, looked so resplendent. Nowadays they have turned into masses of black rocks. Around seven years ago, Pokhara residents witnessed one of the major disasters when flooded Seti river claimed several lives. It does not rain well during the monsoon when farmers prepare for paddy plantation.

Instead of flying the Pyongyang-Shanghai-Singapore route that takes around six-and-a-half hours but passes over sea, Kim Jong-un flew via Beijing, which took around 10 hours.

An aviation source in China said that ""It probably cost a lot of money as well as representing a huge political burden to loan Kim the aircraft,” the publication Chosun Ilbo reported.

However, it was done to better protect the leader as routes over the sea are more difficult to safeguard. To further ensure the secrecy of the leader’s exact route, three planes took off from North Korea at about one hour’s interval: an Ilyushin IL-76, an Air China Boeing 747 and an Ilyushin IL-62.

According to FlightRadar24, a website that tracks the flights of various aircraft, thousands of people followed the progress of Kim Jong-un’s plane.

One diplomatic source in Singapore said that ""Tension was very high in North Korea, hence the secrecy.""

First to arrive in Singapore was the IL-76 transport plane carrying food and other belongings of the DPRK’s leader, as well as his bullet-proof limousine and a portable toilet.

“Keeping Kim’s stool out of others’ reach also prevents details about his health status from leaking to the public,” Lee Yun-keol, a North Korean defector who was previously a North Korean guard command, told the Washington Post.

He went on to say that rather than using a public restroom, the leader has a personal toilet that follows him around when he travels. “The leader’s excretions contain information about his health status so they can’t be left behind,” Yun-keol said.

On Sunday, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met with Kim following the latter’s arrival in the country for the upcoming talks with Trump, scheduled for Tuesday.

The US-North Korean summit will mark the first-ever meeting of sitting leaders of the two countries. The highly-anticipated talks had been put at risk when, on May 24, Trump announced he was canceling the meeting with Kim due to Pyongyang's hostile rhetoric.","The leader of North Korea has arrived to Singapore in what has been a meticulously coordinated scheme shrouded in mystery.

Publish What You Fund, a campaign group, assessed the transparency of 45 organisations worldwide that spend at least $1 billion a year in aid to poor and crisis-affected countries.

One in four either failed to describe the projects they funded at all or described them in technical language that the public would struggle to understand, while only one in three reported the results of such projects.

""This makes it very difficult for watchdogs, partner country governments and donors themselves to understand what is working and if the promised results are being achieved,"" said Catherine Turner, the head of Publish What You Fund.

China's Ministry of Commerce, which manages the country's foreign aid spending, was the worst performer, followed by the foreign ministries of the UAE and Japan.

The Chinese embassy in London said China does not attach political strings to foreign assistance or interfere in the internal affairs of recipient countries.

A UAE foreign ministry spokesman said that it is engaging with a different set of transparency rules. Japan's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Overall, the report said most organisations had made improvements in recent years, with 95 per cent now publishing information to an internationally agreed standard. However, it said some data released was of poor quality or incomplete.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations (U.N.) Development Programme took first and second positions as the most transparent donors, with Britain's Department for International Development (DFID) ranking third best.

""Transparency is a critical aspect of effective development work and we are glad to be at the forefront of it,"" Takehiko Nakao, ADB president said in a statement.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the foreign ministries of New Zealand and Britain were also among the lowest scorers.

""Without transparency, we risk undermining public trust in our life-saving aid,"" said Romilly Greenhill, UK director of The ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.

OCHA said it published its financial data daily and that it was a mistake to measure its performance against a scoring system designed for long-term development aid, as the agency dealt with emergencies.

A New Zealand foreign ministry spokesman said it is committed to transparency but recognised the need for improvement and was taking steps to do so.

Britain's foreign ministry said it had made changes to improve transparency and was ensuring taxpayers' money was spent well but could not release details around some projects in higher-risk countries and conflict zones for security reasons.

""Foreign Office aid is tackling poverty and conflict and boosting prosperity in some of the world's poorest countries,"" a spokeswoman said.

Earlier this month, British lawmakers raised concerns that aid money from a fund managed by the foreign ministry was being spent to develop China's film industry and museums, rather than on helping the world poorest.","China's Ministry of Commerce, which manages the country's foreign aid spending, was the worst performer, followed by the foreign ministries of the UAE and Japan.

“Mountains are the land of freedom”, goes a European saying. Switzerland perhaps lives up to this saying, among several neutral small states in Europe, for being mostly mountainous, permanently “neutral” in war and peace time, and economically highly successful. Given Switzerland’s geo-political and territorial similarities with Nepal, people from both countries seem to have some degree of affinity with each other. In Nepalese geo-political context, always hard-pressed by the Indian and Chinese “suzerainty”, time to time a question arises that “why Nepal could not or cannot become another Switzerland?” Taken at face value, eyeing the Swiss principle and policy does not seem unreasonable as Switzerland bypassed several wars in the European continent including the Word War I (WWI) and WWII. And so did Nepal in the India-China border war in 1962 except the Gorkha force that fought against China- the Gorkha force was formerly British and now an Indian Army regiment which recruits Nepali citizens along with Indians, inherently causing some identity confusion with regard to ethnic origins and nationalities. However, taking into account the historical backgrounds and the present geo-political contexts of these two states, the comparison seems highly asymmetrical making it just an ideal. Besides, it is fundamental to figure out first what the term neutrality entails in the Nepali understanding vis-à-vis Swiss neutrality and its evolution.

Neutrality as a starter:

Despite its small size, one should not discount Swiss military strength which not only successfully protected its 3 forests cantons (provinces/states) by keeping the Habsburg empire and Holy Roman Empire (make easier, Central European Empires) at bay as back as in the period of 13th-18th century, but also made the Allies and the Axis keep guessing about its (Swiss) defense capabilities even as late as in the WW II in the 20th century currently there are 28 cantons. The Swiss neutrality could be either choice or necessity later, but at the onset a necessity was it for sure. The fundamental “political will” of Swiss people to be together as a nation despite being different peoples (Ernst Renan’s What is a nation?; 1882)-the French Swiss, German Swiss and Italian Swiss (and the small minority Romansh) – hinged upon not shifting their allegiance to their respective “big brothers”. This self-restraint strategy had saved Switzerland from cracking off for good when Europe was mired in the Catholic-Protestant war for decades, and so was true in several other events (Charles Kupchan’s How Enemies Become Friends; 2010). Several studies attribute the early 19th century, the Congress of Vienna (in Austria), as a starting point of Swiss neutrality which became a law later in Paris, but the coming together of several Swiss cantons in the early history shows that it in fact goes further back than that-except under France’s (Napoleon’s) domination when it was dragged into war. The Hague Convention of 1907 is the source of international law of neutrality. Some argue that Switzerland always had the psyche of being surrounded by enemies, and its security policy is guided by that (Heinz Gaertner’s Small States and Alliances; Part II: Crisis Management, Engagement and Humanitarian Intervention, Working Paper, 2001).

Dream or Nightmare?

It is not that simple though that one declares armed neutrality and belligerents will spare it? In the WWI Germany invaded neutral Belgium which dragged Britain into the war (Gaertner, 2001). In the WW II Hitler not only neglected the neutrality of Norway, Denmark, Belgium etc, but also invaded Poland and Czechoslovakia who had security guarantees from the Allied-England and France (Ibid.). Only Ireland, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland succeeded to remain outside of the WWII. In the public mind of Switzerland, till as late as in the 1990s, had the perception that it stood as a “bystander” during the “the Jewish Catastrophe” in the WWII (C. Schaer & Vera Sperisen (2010) Switzerland and the Holocaust: teaching contested history, Journal of Curriculum Studies, Vol. 42 Issue 5, p.3). Once France surrendered to Nazi Germany in 1940, Switzerland found itself in the middle of the Fascist and the Nazi, quite close to losing its sovereignty and sharing the Nazi’s crime of “systematic persecution and murder of European Jews” (Ibid.). While Europe was burning, Swiss managed to remain outside through a “mixture of armed neutrality, economic collaboration, political accommodation, and a good deal of luck” (Ibid.). While many enjoyed these ideal memories, some were more realistic. As the war-time documents were unearthed, some ground-breaking details turned the neutral bystander Switzerland into a complicit with the Nazi Germany; because the Swiss government had destroyed the evidences and for many years released only a tampered version of the war history which remained as a truth for many years (Ibid.). One could only imagine what magnitude of shock such 180 degree turn could yield in a society like Switzerland which is basically “religious”, “conservative” and “closed” (a Swiss International Law expert used these terms while talking to this scribe once). The Swiss villages which are still replete with the religious symbols speak for themselves. Bernhard C Schaer and Vera Sperisen write, “This new view focused on the moral challenges that the Nazi regime posed for the country’s leaders. It stressed the importance of Switzerland’s arms industry and transport and financial sectors for the Nazis, as well as the country’s policy of rejecting Jewish asylum-seekers at the border until 1944. This view thus highlighted Switzerland’s economic collaboration with the Nazis and the political adaptation to the regime’s goals.” (Ibid:p. 4)

Expensive Wurst (Sausage):

Marco Wyss also writes in his article, The Advocate and Its Wealthy Client: Britain and Switzerland in the Early Cold War, 2013, in The International History Review, Vol.35, Issue 1, that “Swiss National Bank had purchased stolen gold from the Reichsbank (then central bank of Germany) in exchange for Swiss francs…Berne had regularly complied with the Third Reich’s (then Germany) anti-Semitic (anti-Jews) policy” (Wyss, 2013; p.2) (meanings in brackets are added). He argues that owing to this Swiss “collaboration” with the Nazi, the US and the USSR were so “vexed” that the US imposed some economic punishment while Russia refused to resume any diplomatic relations with Switzerland (Ibid.). After the war, Switzerland feared a new threat, i.e. the “Bolshevik threat” coming from the East-West conflict, but to its dismay it (Switzerland) found itself in a “neutrality trap”. Then again another Allied state came to its rescue, and i.e. the war-torn UK in a desperate need of money. As long as Switzerland continued to buy British weaponries and aircrafts, British continued to lobby in favor of Switzerland from Moscow to Washington, argues Wyss. However, as the UK’s power continued to decline globally, at some point, it was the US itself that came to terms with Swiss policies more than what the UK could do in that (Ibid.). It was the usefulness of the Swiss neutrality both in the eyes of the Allies and the Axis that in the end Switzerland remained neutral in the wars. Both during and after the WWI the westerners had used Swiss neutrality in their favor, and even after the WWII Britain used it against the ever expanding European Union, which Britain always feared as a growing “Franco-German hegemony”. On the Nazi’s side, some argue that Hitler had foreseen that in case of the blockade imposed by the Allies, Switzerland could be an outlet. Needless to mention other benefits for the belligerents, such as, a haven for espionage, refugee-solution, financial transactions, industrial products etc. In fact, the Swiss land and sky were frequently intruded during the WWII by both the Axis and the Allies. Meanwhile, it was in the inter-war period when Switzerland passed its secret banking bill, particularly “in part to allow Germans (including Jews) to hide or protect their assets from seizure by the newly established Third Reich” (Source: Switzerland during the World Wars on Wikipedia.org, accessed on 30 August, 2013). In the post WWI the Switzerland-US relations got under huge strain over the matter of the bank accounts of the victims of Nazi persecution which Switzerland continued to have, known as “dormant accounts”. Incidentally, the fear of losing this secret account privilege is palpable these days in all four countries that are still enjoying this extraordinarily lucrative source in Europe; they are Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, and Luxembourg.

Neutrality Bias:

The neutrality of Switzerland seems to have a plenty of paradoxes. Wyss argues in his article, Neutrality in the early Cold War: Swiss arms imports and neutrality, 2011, in Cold War History, Vol.12, Issue 1, p. 25-49, that Swiss armed neutrality needed modern weaponry, and although a neutral state, it continually bought arms and aircrafts only from Britain providing the latter with much-needed francs, who was a major actor of the Allied force. Switzerland was ideologically and economically inclined towards the West and continued to refuse buying weapons from the east, which on the other hand undermined its armed-neutrality (Wyss, 2011). Wyss writes that (citing Jussi Hanhimaki) that both Switzerland and Sweden are “western neutrals” and both are like a “military extension of NATO” (Ibid: p.3). The main arm suppliers of Switzerland in the cold war, if not Britain, were the major NATO allies, France and the US. And by now, the “new NATO” has successfully brought these small neutral states of Europe, if not through direct membership, then, through “partnership” such as PfP (Partnership for Peace program) and so on to contribute to the overall objective of the NATO-alliance. These neutral states, at the end of the day, have participated indirectly in the cases from Kosovo to Afghanistan. The European integrationist argues that, in the light of changing threat where enemies are not in the next-door but hundreds of miles away and are possibly non-states actors rather than states, Switzerland together with other small states had tangled into neutrality trap which is barring them from the practice of “security through cooperation”. In case of Switzerland, even if the elites so desired, it is politically not possible (Gaertner, 2001). However, pro-neutrals continue to argue in favor of neutrality, for instance in Austria, but accept the evolution that the neutrality before and after are not the same, but neutrality it still is (Ibid.).

Let bygones be bygones:

The reason that Switzerland did not join the UN until as late as in 2002 is because basically its people- its constitutional practice of “direct democracy” where referendum should be held for any such law-changing decisions- were skeptical of any international environment that would jeopardize the traditional pride of neutrality. On the other hand, the political elites seemed in favor of joining. The same is true of the case of EU. However, it is not that the citizens of other EU members do not complain, but they or at least their elites decided to join the EU club. For instance, the conservative British who still cherish their colonial past incessantly complain about the Polish workers “invasion” of London or the label of EU directives on the products they buy at their own super- market chain Tesco and so on. In any event, at a quick glance, it seems that Switzerland is sort of a half-hearted EU member, if not through the accession, but through the bilateral treaties. By now Switzerland has signed almost 300 (rough figure) bilateral treaties with the EU and has the obligations to follow the EU directives in many sectors. There were negotiations about joining the European Economic Area, but the possibility ended as Swiss people voted “no” in a referendum in 1992. However, Switzerland is part of EFTA and in 2008 it also signed Schengen agreements. Nepalese with a visa to enter Hungary or Poland could enter Switzerland with the same as they all are in Schengen area. Tourists take out the Euros (European common currency), not Swiss francs, from their pockets to buy things in St. Moritz or Engelberg with the equal confidence as the Indians take out their Indian Rupees in Chitwan or Pokhara in Nepal. After all, who in Europe would eternally want to miss out on the economic opportunities and security guarantees the EU offers? Having said that, Switzerland is still not an EU member, thus remains out of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of Europe (CFSP), among many other EU policies.

Swiss secret:

This study started with the objective to find some underlying factors that had supported the neutrality of Switzerland so that they would be useful to apply to the Nepali context. However, the findings show hardly any evidence that, beside Switzerland not explicitly participating in the wars, it is or will be a neutral in the absolute term. Neutrality of Switzerland and the interest of the other belligerent states do not seem mutually exclusive, although in the armed-neutrality it was so. However, one has to give credit to the Swiss people, either for their internal necessity or external choice, for their will of remaining neutral although porous at times, which at the end of the day shaped the geopolitics in a way that the belligerents had no choice but to accept it. The key to success, the complex internal balance between the Swiss provinces, would be further clear from the following example which was not discussed above. One of the nine Federal Provinces of present-day Austria, Vorarlberg which shares the border with Switzerland, in the aftermath of WWI when the Austrian empire collapsed, decided to hold a referendum to secede from Austria and to integrate with their linguistic counterparts, the Swiss Germans. The Austrians of that federation voted “yes”, but to their dismay Switzerland replied with a “no”. French Swiss and Italian Swiss prevented it from happening, as argued by some. Last but not the least, high economic and industrial competitiveness made Switzerland way too important and big in the eyes of the others regardless of its small size.

Fish n’ chips, Pau bhaji, Chow mein and Dal bhat:

When we talk about the economic leverage Switzerland possessed which it used for the rationalist bargaining against the belligerents around 19th-20th centuries, we are talking about the-then richest and the most powerful continent in the world, Europe. It was only after the WW II the Old Continent was left devastated and the colonial powers started to lose their “crown provinces” around the world. Then their (Europeans) own brethren emerged as the next super power, which is known as the United States of America. By contrast, the political-economy of Nepal should be examined in the context of colonized continent. Still, Nepalese are surrounded by two giants who house most of all (in millions) the poorest of the poor people of the world. In geographical term, given the natural frontier in the north, India had/has practically surrounded Nepal from every corner. In those days the Chinese themselves had to ask for British permission to go to Tibet via Calcutta to make the trip shorter (source: Neville Maxwell’s India’s China War Neville, 1970). Unsurprisingly, from the day one Nepal submitted to the domination of India. Maxwell writes that British could not annex Nepal in the post 1814-16 treaty because it had feared Chinese reaction. British saw Nepal as a part of their “chain of protectorates” together with Sikkim and Bhutan thus securing their border up to the southern flank of the Himalayas (Maxwell, 1970). British saw that although Nepal rested under Chinese suzerainty, they (British) seemed satisfied that Nepal accepted British sphere of influence (Ibid.). Some Nepalese commentators also do not seem confident in claiming that Nepal had enjoyed a complete sovereign status vis-à-vis British or post-British India and it was so both during the Rana rule or the Panchayat rule. Experts claim that domestic movements in Nepal time to time further invited India’s undue involvement in Nepalese politics.

Maxwell reveals an interesting fact that the Congress party (India) had envisaged a democratic India in the post-British rule, and had so anticipated the policies whereby the neighbors would need not to be wary of India. However, once the British were gone, the party adopted even more aggressive policies towards the cis-Himalayan states, but he did not explain why so. One could derive that although Nepal managed to remain a complete sovereign on paper, the informal understanding at least among Indians, if not Nepalese, regarding Nepal did not defer much from Sikkim’s or Bhutan’s status. India apparently had expected that China would respect that understanding; however, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal changed the game. Besides, commentators claim that Nehru was disappointed over Nepal remaining aloof from the India-China border conflict. Unsurprisingly, India never endorsed the king Birendra’s Zone of Peace (ZoP) proposal although the idea itself deserved nothing but praise as it sought to secure Nepal’s sovereignty and a peaceful co-existence in the region (see Isabelle Duquesne’s Zone of Peace discussion on telegraphnepal.com). First, the proposal apparently contradicted the spirit of 1950 friendship treaty. Second, it was the supposed informal understanding between Beijing and New Delhi that India would remain silent on Tibet cause and China would reciprocate on India’s domination of Nepal. Third, given the Chinese paranoid in India particularly after China dumped India’s diplomatic romance, for security reasons there seemed no way India would endorse such a desire from the King of whom they were already skeptical- that the king could dilly-dally on the way. According to Saurav, a prominent analyst from Nepal, “(New) Delhi had perceived that the others’ support of ZoP was being used to put pressure on India” (ekantipur.com/np accessed on 04/09/2013).

Train on the roof is calling:

While the hardship to resupply the Jawans (soldiers) up north in 1962 is still fresh in the Indian mind, the smooth Chinese asphalt has already reached Nepal. Besides, it is not just a fantasized dream anymore that China could build a railway up to Tatopani border (Nepal-Tibet/China border at a distance of around 120 km from Kathmandu) or in other points-pretty likely to happen sooner or later. Regarding the “wordplay”, the “equidistance” has apparently changed into “equi-proximity”, although some commentators would not easily accept this reality. Anyways, as a corollary of the Chinese proximity, the Indian intelligence, RAW, has reportedly stepped up its “gesture” in Nepal and will become much bigger in the days ahead. Since the changing realities make any possible “macro management” (annexation or control the foreign and security policy) out of the question, logically the outsiders have resorted to a “micro-management” (undue interference at every level) to safeguard their own interests. Being a buffer state, and given the global dimension of growing Chinese might and the US’s “pivot” to Asia, commentators in Nepal quite reasonably argue that outsiders’ interference in Nepal will become a part of their life.

While Switzerland, arguably, is preparing itself in the context of changing threats from conventional/military ones to non-military threats, the conditions are predisposing Nepal, to much of its dismay, to bear the brunt of both. Events unfolding clearly give that signal. Recently in two separate events, Indian Intelligence agencies arrested Abdul Karim Tunda, a Laskar-e-Taiba member and Yasin Bhaktal, a most wanted terrorism suspect, in the India-Nepal border areas; the leading news daily, Kantipur, reported that Bhaktal was actually caught in Kathmandu itself. Talking to the BBC Nepali radio service, the Nepal-India relations expert Gen. Ashok Mehta said that these are the “biggest catch in Nepal ever”. On the military side, India has recently bought with the US 10 transport aircrafts, the C-17 Globe Master, capable of lifting tanks to the border in the North and the North East. One of these aircrafts has already touched a base in Uttar Pradesh. It is worth recalling that by building a home-made warship INS Vikrant very recently, which can carry MiG 29K fighters, India has joined the exclusive club of four which have the capability to design and build such a war-ship: Russia, UK, US and France (Source: NDTV).

Time is definitely not easy for India. It has got entangled, on the one hand, in an economic free fall with 400 million population still under $ 1.25 a day (2010 Data; Source Fareed Zakaria’s Global Poverty is falling, so what’s the problem? on cnn.com), and a massive investment on military on the other. China, with three decades of 2 digit economic growth and the colossal military budget second to the US, is successfully keeping its opponents guessing at what security strategy China follows. Whether it is the “Confucian-Mencian” strategy that anticipates the “submission” of enemies without resorting to force or the “hard realpolitik…parabellum…offensive strategy” to storm enemies (Alastair Iain Johnston’s Cultural Realism and Strategy in Maoist China in The Culture of National Security, 1996), to India’s dismay, it has no option but to prepare for every eventuality. Needless to say, that all these Indian hardships will most likely befall Nepal.

So what’s for dessert?

While Indians point to Nepal’s reluctance to cooperate with India’s security concerns and they say that they have bigger fish to fry, the crux of the matter has been the confusing meaning of that “concerns”. Experts claim that the security cooperation proposal from India always comes with strings attached. India’s proposal to king Birendra in 1989-90 and the recent draft treaty on building security posts along the border reinforce the fact that these proposals come with some disturbing or controversial clauses also (for these proposals and treaties, see www.telegraphnepal.com). In the idealist term, for all the good virtues that exist in Nepali society, with regard to the armed-neutrality, Nepal has every possibility to remain neutral if it so desires (see Dev Raj Dahal’s Zone of Peace: Revised Concept for Nepal Constitution on telegraphnepal.com). In the security term, both the neighbors’ extra-care for Nepal Army (NA) suggests that the NA would not be in a position to take one side anyway. Finally, in the realist or constructivist term, neutrality in stricter terms, seems a far cry.

Today, more and more Meos sit idle, jobless and penniless.

There are no prominent NGOs working in this Meo belt, even the outreach programs and schemes seem to have done little. The literacy levels are all time low and with that stark poverty, poor agricultural yield and disease .

This, when the young Meos are very keen to study, eat better, get jobs. They have said that they want to be on par with the Baniyas and Rajputs of their belt but governmental schemes do not reach the Muslim population. ‘Of course, we want to improve our lot but how?

Just because we are poor Meos they treat us like cattle. They only go to the cluster of shopkeepers who control the market place and the trading, The junior rung officers are close to the traders and bypass the Meo Muslim masses.’

A large number of villagers confirmed and stressed that they were not even aware of any outreach programmes for the rural poor by the government. They were not aware of the health, educational or social welfare schemes.

Perhaps, their plight can be best relayed in the words of a Meo whom I had met during one of my earlier travels to the region - ‘I have passed my matriculate exams, but when it comes to jobs there are none for us. We Meos are treated shabbily by sarkari men. Many a time I have heard snide comments like 'Meo, you’re dirty and lazy!' Have you ever bothered to find out why! We also want to bathe 10 times a day, but we can't , because there's no water! Not even a drop. Is there even one canal in our parched lands? None! This, when my forefathers did all they could do to fight the British. But see what is happening to us in azaad Hindustan!’

The Meos cannot expect much from the Right Wing rulers of the day but its about time that not just the well-known NGOs come forward but even the community leaders from the various states of the country. Its about time to see their plight and reach out to them.","There are no prominent NGOs working in this Meo belt, even the outreach programs and schemes seem to have done little.

The Good Book says, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” It is a maxim that aims to guide those who seek to deliver the message of peace and reconciliation to humanity. It is a message that teaches true peace is found between individuals or nations by restoring broken relationships in a reconciliation process.

Today, PM Abiy told the people of Egypt, “What I want to tell the people of Egypt is that we Ethiopians know the value of spirit of brotherhood and neighborhood and we are God-fearing people, and we will never harm the people of Egypt.”

The Good Book also says, “There is no peace for the wicked.” There is no peace for those who seek to impose peace-at-the-barrel-of-the-gun, commit aggression or seek to maintain a state of no-peace-no-war.

Last week, by announcing to fully implement the 2002 “Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission DECISION Regarding Delimitation of the Border between The State of Eritrea and The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia” Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia delivered on a promise he made during his inaugural address in April:

With the government of Eritrea, we want from the bottom of our hearts that the disagreement that has reigned for years comes to an end. We would also discharge our responsibility. While expressing our readiness resolve our differences through dialogue, I take this opportunity to call on the Eritrean government to take a similar stand not only for the sake of our common interest but also for the common blood relations between the peoples of the two countries.

In offering an olive branch to Eritrea, PM Abiy did not hide behind ambiguous diplomatic language or politically correct words of evasion. He spoke from the heart and demonstrated to the world that he is a man committed to peace and reconciliation at home and abroad.

I am deeply touched that PM Abiy should speak from the “bottom of the heart” to resolve “differences through dialogue”. All politicians I know speak in forked tongue from both sides of their mouths. A true man of peace speaks in the rhythm of his heartbeat not in the drumbeats of war pounding in his mind.

Having witnessed 27 years of divide and rule and rule by war, violence and revenge, I never thought I would see a leader in Ethiopia who would risk everything on peace and reconciliation at home and commit to the principle of “Love thy neighbor.” Alas! “Hope springs eternal in the human breast; Man never is, but always to be blessed”, reassured us Alexander Pope.

In announcing his government decision to fully comply with the Boundary Commission’s Decision, PM Abiy said:

All that we have achieved from the [stalemate with Eritrea] situation of the last 20 years is tension. Neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea benefit from a stalemate. We need to expend all our efforts towards peace and reconciliation and extricate ourselves from petty conflicts and divisions and focus on eliminating poverty.

In just a few sentences composed in the heart, PM Abiy broke the decades-old evil spell that had bedeviled and paralyzed diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In such a simple act, PM Abiy silenced the “crash of guns, the rattle of musketry and the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield”, to borrow a phrase form Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

The guns silenced, the suffering people of Ethiopia and Eritrea may now speak, shout out, that the two countries hereafter “shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.” Witnessing swords beaten into plowshares is a source of great joy for me.

Since taking office, PM Abiy has made a specialty out of stunning everyone with his bold and courageous moves. He is introducing such fast-paced changes in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region, they are calling him “Prime Minster Bolt” (after Usain Bolt the world record holder as the fastest sprinter).

Every day, PM Abiy proves to the world that he is a true transformational leader. He is not only transforming structures and processes of governance, he is, most importantly and positively, transforming the hearts and minds of Ethiopians in the country and in the Diaspora. Hardly a day passes without someone telling me, “I was suspicious of Abiy at first because “They” brought him up in their ranks and “They” made him prime minister. But now he has won me over.”

That is the irresistible magic of Abiy Ahmed. In less than ten weeks he has managed to conquer the hearts and minds of even the stone-hearted and the steeled mind with sincerity, humility, kindness, compassion, love, professionalism and fairness.

For me, the icing on the cake is that he wears his Ethiopiawinet on his sleeve for everyone to see. Just like me.

When PM Abiy took office, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman Cohen tweeted:

Message for new Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed: Do not be reluctant to take bold steps toward democratic reform. TPLF politico-economic monopolists have been revealed as frauds, and will not be able to restrain you. International community is with you.

In 2012, Ambassador Cohen said, “They [TPLF] are condemned to rule the country as a minority and that is very dangerous for [Ethiopia’s] stability.” In December 2015, Ambassador Cohen condemned extrajudicial killings and arbitrary detentions by the TPLF regime. “The political leaders of the Ethiopian Government have a policy of killing all opponents who take to the streets to demonstrate against them.” In December 2017, he prophesied of the TPLF, “Mainly there is no sharing of economic or political power, and that there was such a small group. It is very unhealthy and it would not last. It couldn’t possibly last, which I see evidence now but it is not lasting.”

There is little doubt that PM Abiy has rock solid support in the Ethiopian people and the international community for his reform and democratization efforts at home and bold moves to stabilize the Horn of Africa region. Indeed, his decision to implement the Boundary Commission’s Decision shall immeasurably enhance the stability of the region.

Speaking truth to those barking up the wrong tree: Blame Meles Zenawi NOT Abiy Ahmed for the outcome of the Boundary Commission Decision

There are those who are today grumbling about PM Abiy’s announcement to implement the Decision. They angrily declare he committed an “act of treason”, a “historic blunder” and a “shameful act” by deciding to implement the Decision unconditionally. They say thousands of Ethiopians died defending the Ethiopian Eritrean border and the town of Badme and many more thousands ended up in exile as a result of the border war. They claim PM Abiy’s “dictatorial government” made its decision to implement the Decision without public debate, input, discussion and professional consultations. They made good on their threat to hold “large public meetings” and undertake “demonstrations” to show their displeasure and opposition to PM Abiy’s decision.

Unfortunately, those who want to pin the blame on PM Abiy are barking up the wrong tree.

They are uninformed, misinformed, misguided and without any familiarity with the 1) terms of the Algiers Agreement, 2) the specific mandates of the Boundary Commission, 3) the flawed treaties and other defective reports and evidence reviewed by the Commission in reaching its demarcation decision, 4) the inept legal arguments and analysis presented to the Commission and 5) the rigid procedural rules of the arbitration proceeding.

In the following analysis, I hope to temper the inflamed emotions and passions of those reacting negatively to PM Abiy’s decision by enlightening them on the tragic facts of the Boundary Commission Decision.

The essential facts are as follows:

On December 8, 2000, the House of Peoples’ Representatives issued Proclamation No. 225/2000 “ratifying the peace agreement” between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

On December 12, 2000, the late Meles Zenawi agreed and personally signed the Algiers Agreement and specifically agreed to

have a neutral Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission composed of five members established with a mandate to delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty border based on pertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902 and 1908) and applicable international law. (Art. 4(2).)

have the UN Cartographer provide the technical expertise in establishing boundary lines and other related matters. (Art. 4(7).)

present written and oral submissions and any additional evidence directly to the Commission on portions of the border that are in dispute. (Art. 4 (10.))

have the final decision of the Border Commission regarding delimitation of the borders to be transmitted to the Secretaries General of the OAU and the United Nations which shall arrange for expeditious demarcation. (Art. 4 (13)

specifically accept the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the Commission as final and binding. (Art. 4(15.))

the mandate of the Commission to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage related to the conflict (art. 5(1)).

Representing Ethiopia on the record before the Boundary Commission were Seyoum Mesfin, Fisseha Yimer and Seifeselassie Lemma, supported by legal team which included a retired Oxford University professor of international law and two American and two French lawyers.

The Boundary Commission held hearings at the Peace Palace in The Hague from December 10-21, 2001. Representatives of the two countries presented their legal arguments and analysis of the evidence to the Commission.

Four months later on April 3, 2002, the Boundary Commission issued its 112-page unanimous Decision demarcating the boundary line (with maps) between Eritrea and Ethiopia. (See pp. 173-179 of Decision.)

On April 14, 2002, Seyoum Mesfin declared, “Ethiopia accepts the ruling. Ethiopia is satisfied. We hope that the decision will once and for all seal any attempt by military adventurers to change the boundary by means of force.” Seyoum added, “This is a victory of peace over aggression and violence. It is a victory of law over the rule of the jungle.” Seyoum publicly declared that the town of Badme had been awarded to Ethiopia and accused “the Eritrean government of trying to cause ‘confusion’ by stating it had been awarded the village of Badme [which is] “an integral part of Ethiopian sovereign territory”.

On April 16, 2002, Meles Zenawi accepting the Commission’s Decision declared victory: “The [Boundary Commission] ruling has supported and complied with the stance that we were pursuing from the outset. In my opinion this is our major victory.”

Let’s face the raw facts!

If people are looking to pin the blame for the outcome of the Boundary Commission Decision on someone, they need to look no further than Meles Zenawi, Seyoum Mesfin, Fisseha Yimer and Seifeselassie Lemma.

The commitment to binding arbitration was a blunder of astronomical proportions. Once Meles signed the Algiers Agreement, the fate of Badme and all other territorial issues on the northern border was sealed. In the Algiers Agreement, Meles had boxed Ethiopia into a corner from which she cannot get out. Binding arbitration became a crap shoot for Ethiopia. Any decision of the Boundary Commission will be legally final and irreversible. There were other alternatives to binding arbitration.

Meles Zenawi did not have to agree to binding arbitration, which means a small group of privately selected experts will play act as judges (Commission) and decide issues of extreme importance to Ethiopia. No one put a gun to his head and forced him to sign the Algiers Agreement. He knew that “binding arbitration” means Ethiopia will, without question, accept the Decision of the Commission whether she liked it or not and that the fate of the town of Badme was at grave risk.

Meles was under no obligation to submit to binding arbitration particularly given the fact that Eritrea was the first to launch a war of aggression and was subsequently successfully repelled by Ethiopian forces. After Ethiopia’s military victory, Meles was in a superior bargaining position to dictate certain conditions on the aggressor regime as preconditions to binding arbitration, including access to the port of Assab. How any leader of a country would squander such a historic opportunity and casually turn over to binding arbitration a victory gained in the battlefield through the sacrifices of tens of thousands of soldiers simply boggles the mind!

Meles was also under no obligation to commit to binding arbitration for the final border delimitation and demarcation based on the July 10, 1900 treaty between Italy and Ethiopia (which was superseded by the May 15, 1902 Treaty between the UK, Italy and Ethiopia), and the Italo-Ethiopian Convention of May 16, 1908. These so-called treaties, which were literally forced upon Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II who decisively defeated the Italian colonial invaders in 1896, had significant flaws and should not have been agreed to as the bases for a final border status determination.

For instance, the 1908 Treaty indicated the borderline would go in the southeast direction and “proceed parallel to and at a distance of 60kms from the coast, until it joins the frontier of the French possessions of Somalia”. The two governments promised to “undertake to fix the above mentioned frontier-line on the spot by common accord and as soon as possible.” There is no record anywhere that shows they established the frontier-line accordingly. Yet, the 1908 Treaty was used as a valid treaty for binding arbitration.

During the arbitration hearing, “the first question that arose in the application of the 1908 was the definition of the coast. Ethiopia abandoned its conception of the coast as including islands and submitted in its concluding argument that “the coastline” should be understood as “adhering continuously to the continent itself, and not any coastlines of islands as such.” (See Decision, p. 89.)

Seyoum Mesfin handled the arbitration process in a manner that could only be described as depraved indifference and criminal negligence in disregarding the national interests of Ethiopia. For crying out loud, how is it possible on God’s green earth to have such an incompetent, ignorant and clueless foreign minister representing the national interests of a nation!?

Ethiopia is today paying the ultimate price of Goethe’s admonition. “There is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action.”

It must be double underscored that Seyoum Mesfin personally represented and hired the lawyers that represented Ethiopia before the Boundary Commission. Seyoum Mesfin personally directed the legal strategy, and with Meles Zenawi, set the legal positions of Ethiopia on all of the contested territorial issues before the Commission.

To add insult to injury, in accepting the Commission’s Decision, Seyoum Mesfin said, “Ethiopia accepts the ruling. Ethiopia is satisfied.”

I don’t know whether I should cry my eyes out or pull out my hair!

Fisseha Yimer and Seifeselassie Lemma directly participated in critical supporting role in the litigation before the Commission. I will predict that if these two individuals were asked of their role, they will cover their rear ends by saying, “We advised otherwise but in the end did what we were told to do.”

In the end, when the Boundary Commission issued its Decision, Meles declared “victory”. Why didn’t he want to implement a Decision that gave him “victory”?

It is because Meles wanted to play political football with Badme. Meles purposefully calculated that he could use Badme and the border dispute as political football — a wedge issue to divide Ethiopians – and manipulate and exploit patriotic sentiments over territorial land and as a weapon in his games of mass distraction to maintain himself in power.

Meles understood that full compliance with the Commission’s Decision would stoke the ire and anger of all Ethiopians. He knew he would be blamed for bargaining away in arbitration land for which so many tens of thousands died defending. He feared it would be perceived and understood as the ultimate betrayal by the Ethiopian people. He believed he could pander to the Ethiopian public by appearing defiant and refusing to comply. He thought he could keep the stalemate going by threatening war and distracting the public.

Meles kept the issue of compliance with the Commission’s Decision at bay periodically spreading rumors of war and threatening war with Eritrea. In June 2016, the pre-PM Abiy regime set spread rumors of war and sounded the drumbeats of war signaling a ground war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

But Meles’ betrayal and treachery with Ethiopian sovereignty and territory did not begin or end with the Algiers Agreement. From Day 1, he has been playing fast and loose with Ethiopian territory. He gave away the port of Assab and landlocked Ethiopia. When he had the chance to bargain for Assab in exchange for binding arbitration, he squandered the opportunity. Meles secretly ceded away Ethiopian territory to the Sudan and for pennies literally sold Ethiopian land to so-called investors.

Badme was no different to Meles. It was just another piece of Ethiopian territory he could give away as he pleased. In any case, for Meles there was no such thing as “Ethiopia” only nations, nationalities and peoples”. If such a thing existed, it would not be more than 100 years old.

We can all do Monday morning quarterbacking about what “coulda, woulda and shoulda” have been done, but the Badme horse is out of the barn and gone. Badme is water under the bridge. There is nothing that can be done legally to undo it or challenge it. There can be no buyer’s remorse. Ethiopia cannot go back to December 2000 and undo the Algiers Agreement. Once Meles signed on the dotted line in the Algiers Agreement, it was all over. The fate of Badme was sealed. The Decision of the Boundary Commission will be implemented without ifs or buts.

It may be hard to swallow for some people but the outcome of the Border Commission Decision is the tar baby of the gang of four: Meles Zenawi, Seyoum Mesfin, Fisseha Yimer and Seifeselassie Lemma! It is the result of their handiwork. Their fingerprints are all over the Decision. History will record that Meles Zenawi, Seyoum Mesfin, Fisseha Yimer and Seifeselassie Lemma, and those parliamentarians who voted for Proclamation No. 225/200 are solely responsible for the loss of Badme and any borderline that will eventually be demarcated.

So, we must face the unavoidable question: What is the problem with PM Abiy Ahmed implementing a Decision accepted as a “victory” by Meles Zenawi and “satisfactory” by Seyoum Mesfin?

Those who criticize PM Abiy for his decision to implement the Commission’s Decision should learn a lesson in the rule of international law. A party to a binding international legal proceeding does not have the luxury of accepting a decision only when the party likes the outcome or prevails. It is not possible to call international jurists and intimidate and threaten to fire or jail them if they do not do our bidding. We do not have the option of rejecting a binding arbitration decision because we reject the outcome could get us into political hot water.

It is ironic that Seyoum Mesfin should describe the Commission’s Decision as “a victory of peace over aggression and violence. It is a victory of law over the rule of the jungle.” That is an extraordinary statement coming from someone who has lived all his life by the rule of the jungle.

Ultimately, those barking at PM Abiy should ask themselves, “Did Meles lie to them? Is it Meles or MeLIES? Did Seyoum lie to them? Does the LF in TPLF stand for Lie Factory?”

A sidebar on Seyoum Mesfin, the crocodile patriot

Last week, Seyoum Mesfin, the same man who sold Badme down the river, was pontificating about how PM Abiy is “dirtying” the government and waging a psychological war on the people of Tigray. Seyoum Mesfin said:

Among the defense forces only 14% are from Tigray. That is the number of people born in Tigray and are part of the defense forces. Only 14% out of 100. Because general Samora is supreme etat major [“chief of staff”] only, it is called a TPLF army or woyane army. Is that the truth? Is that the belief of the people of Ethiopia? It is not. Are the Ethiopian armed forces represented by the so-called Agazi army? It is an army, an institution, that came out of nations, nationalities and peoples. It is an army in which everyone can see their own mirror images, their own portraits. That is the only institution that reflects the [diversity] people. It is that institution they are dirtying. Why is it that they are dirtying the security institution? Why did they target them? If these institutions collapse, the government will collapse. If these institutions collapse the constitution will collapse. They will dance on it [on the tattered remains of these institutions] as they please. That is their aim. The people of Ethiopia know this is and they must struggle against it knowing this. The people of Tigray are taking to the front lines to defend against the psychological warfare. They have to know that they have to be in the forefront in the struggle. That is the idea I have. (Emphasis added.)

In February, the same Seyoum Mesfin, who is today calling the people of Tigray to arms over an imaginary psychological war, was calling the people of Tigray to arms to defend against an imaginary genocidal civil war to be waged on them and sounding the wail of victimhood after 27 long years in the saddle of power. (See my “Rejoinder to Seyoum Mesfin’s Call to Arms to the People of Tigray.)

What is obvious to me is the fact that Seyoum Mesfin himself is waging his own psychological war on PM Abiy by demonizing him as one “dirtying” the government and the constitution. Seyoum Mesfin is waging a psychological war of his own by implicitly threatening civil war (claiming “glaring and extremely, extremely alarming danger the people of Tigray are facing”), a military coup (“the government will collapse and Seyoum and his gang will save it) and secession (by establishing the Republic of Tigray).

Nice try Seyoum, but no one is buying your fear and smear tactics.

It is important to note what Seyoum Mesfin believes to be a “psychological war” is actually PM Abiy’s battle for the hearts and minds of Ethiopians inside the country and in the Diaspora. Seyoum either cannot figure it out or is being disingenuous. But from what I have been able to conclude, he is like the proverbial man who carries a hammer for whom everything looks like a nail to him.

For Seyoum who knows only war, the battle for hearts and minds sure looks like psychological war to him.

It is Seyoum’s right to play his own psychological war games, but as I have said so many times, it is GAME OVER for Seyoum and his gang!

What is the alternative to compliance with the Boundary Commission Decision?

The only alternative to compliance with the Boundary Commission Decision is war, war and more war. An estimated 70,000 to 120,000 soldiers and civilians died in the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict between 1998-2000. That is enough death and destruction. No more deaths. No more war. War has been tried and failed.

In 2011, Meles Zenawi threatened to “facilitate ways for the Eritrean people to remove their dictatorial regime.” Meles said:

Recently, Eritrea is training and deploying Al Shabab and locally grown destructive forces to terrorize our country. But Egypt is the direct force behind these destructive elements that back them. Until now, our strategy has been defending our sovereignty by speeding up our development. Now, we found that we could not go any longer with passive defense. It’s not possible to take passive defense as the only alternative. Therefore, we have to facilitate ways for Eritrean people to remove their dictatorial regime. We have no intention to jump into their country but we need to extend our influence there. If the Eritrean government tries to attack us, we will also respond proportionally. (Emphasis added.)

Meles planned a regime change for Eritrea. But the force of destiny produced a difference result.

Meles Zenawi’s invasion of Somalia beginning in 2006 caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Somalis civilians through indiscriminate shelling and displacement of hundreds of thousands.

How many Ethiopian soldiers died in Zenawi’s war in Somalia?

In 2009, Meles Zenawi told “parliament it does not need to know how many soldiers died in Somalia”.

How many Ethiopian soldiers who fought in the border war were repatriated to their country. All of the Eritrean prisoners of war in Ethiopia were returned to their home, but how many Ethiopian prisoners of war were returned from Eritrea?

Now is not a time for war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The time is right now for both countries to “beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.”

The much maligned British Prime Minster Neville Chamberlain said, “In war whichever side may call itself victor. There are no winners. But all are losers.”

In another Ethiopia-Eritrea War, who will be the losers?

Martin Plaut, the former Africa editor, BBC World Service News, in a guest column he wrote for my blogsite in September 2017 argued “thousands lost their lives tragically in the senseless border war.” In frustration, Plaut observed:

Empires crumble; regimes fall; kingdoms turn to dust. But peoples endure. And – in my view – there is little that separates the peoples of Ethiopia and Eritrea. In fact, far more unites them. They have a rare intelligence and a depth of understanding; a wonderful shared heritage and culture. They also share negative traits: stubbornness, inflexibility and a secretiveness which makes progress so very hard to achieve.

I applaud PM Abiy for breaking the old mold of stubbornness, inflexibility, secretiveness, fear and loathing and usher in a new era of open diplomacy based on genuine commitment to peace, reconciliation and advancement of the mutual interests of the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea.

I have always believed that Ethiopia and Eritrea are one people separated by stubborn, inflexible, secretive and insecure leaders. Ethiopia is truly blessed to have a young dynamic leader without any ego issues, open minded, forward-thinking, courageous, rational, thoughtful, committed and brilliant. I shall prophesy that Ethiopia and Eritrea will become one nation one way or the other. The other being when they both become democratic. That is foreordained!

There is a familiar old saying about fighting (warring) elephants and the grass. The grass was always the loser. This time the grass – the people – have come out as the real winner in a war among elephants.

PM Abiy takes a page out of Mandela’s playbook

PM Abiy took a page out of Mandela’s playbook when he decided to implement the Boundary Commission’s Decision unconditionally. Mandela said, “If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.”

I know PM Abiy does not like to use the word “enemy”, but I shall use it here metaphorically.

Mandela’s sound advice comes from his long and hard struggle against the minority apartheid regime in South Africa. He understood reconciling with the apartheid enemy was necessary to achieve peace, justice and reconciliation. He knew the old ways of hate and revenge and the pursuit of eye for an eye will turn South Africa into a nation of blind people. Mandela knew a paradigm shift in thinking and perception was necessary to transition South Africa into a democratic society. He decided to use the strategy of negotiation, instead of war and militarism, to win against his enemies.

Working with the enemy cannot be based on deception and one-upmanship. It must be based on integrity, sincerity, commitment and insight on both sides. It requires leadership that is capable of learning from the mistakes of the past, a commitment not to repeat them and march headlong into the future with confidence and faith that God helps those who help themselves and each other.

Working with the enemy is the only way out of a situation of war and no war, no peace.

PM Abiy breaks the spell of war with the magic of friendship, peace and reconciliation

PM Abiy said Ethiopia will fully accept and implement the peace deal that ended the war. His reasons for accepting the decision show that he is not only a man of peace but a strategic thinker of extraordinary depth. Neighbors can only live in peace if they restore their broken relationships.

In his statement announcing unconditional implementation of the Boundary Commission’s Decision, PM Abiy said (clip at 1:20):

The issue that has caused us a lot of controversy grief for a long time and got a resolution yesterday is our relation with Eritrea. Political experts describe our present relationship with Eritrea over the past 20 years in three scenarios: First, they say we are and have been in a state of war. We have an option to wage war. The second choice is no war, no peace. That is what the rest of the world calls our current situation. I don’t agree with this interpretation. There is no such thing as no war, no peace. I call it war without casualties. There may not be many dead, but the fact remains the burden of war remains including all of the financial cost, anxiety and training have remained on the border. Soldiers may fight for an hour or two to win or to lose but the preparation for war and expectation of attack and the psychological anxiety is no different than preparing or waging an actual war. For the past 20 years our soldiers suffering in the deserts and in the trenches have neither had the opportunity to fight or have peace. They live in a state of constant anxiety. What we have is a state of no war, no peace occasionally involving deaths. It is necessary not only for Ethiopia but also the Horn of Africa to stop this no war, no peace situation. Because Ethiopia is a great country with great people …. In Africa, Ethiopia is a great country and it is the responsibility of responsible government leadership to ensure peace between Asmara and Addis Ababa. There should be bus and train service and our economic relations must expand and we must take the initiative to facilitate closer relations between people bound in brotherhood. All Ethiopians must realize this. ..

Mandela said his greatest dream was to see Africa in peace with itself.

In July 2012, I wrote about my “Dreams of an Ethiopia in Peace.” Today, I can peace in my eyes. Hear it in my ears. Feel it in my heart. Think it in my mind. I pray, “Peace be upon Ethiopia.”

Back in my day, when I was young and full of hope, we used to sing about peace to the lyrics of John Lennon: “All we are saying is Give peace a chance”.

We used to dream with Lennon and

Imagine all the people living life in peace

You may say I’m a dreamer

But I’m not the only one

I hope someday you’ll join us

And the world will be as one…

In his inaugural speech, Nelson Mandela said, “Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another. If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.”

You may say young Abiy Ahmed and I, in my golden years, are just dreamers. But all we are saying is give peace a chance in Ethiopia and join us as we set on two roads called Goodness and Forgiveness to our ultimate destination where there is a shining city upon a hill called “New Ethiopia”.

All are welcome in New Ethiopia. All are friends. No enemies. All you need to bring is your Humanity passbook and leave everything behind.

So, come and join us any way you can. As MLK said, “If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.”

Come and lead us or follows us. If you can’t lead or follow, please get out of the way on the roads called Goodness and Forgiveness!

Post Script

After I wrote my Memorandum No. 8 asking PM Abiy to “please, please come and be our guest in the U.S.”, I have been getting a steady stream of inquiries about the robust support and defense I have provided the PM in the blogosphere and other media.

I am asked why I have completely changed my tune and “overnight” become the “fiercest” supporter of the leader of the EPRDF regime. Did I know PM Abiy before he took office? Am I friends with him? How is it that I never gave Meles Zenawi one ounce of credit in all the years of my writing but began defending and promoting Abiy Ahmed from the day he took office without doing anything? When is PM Abiy coming to the U.S.?

First, I have never met or spoken to PM Abiy at any time or at any place. But I feel like I have known him for years. I believe my sentiment is shared widely that when we watch PM Abiy talk on Youtube, he connects with us at a personal level. Perhaps he knows about me as I have been a fixture on everyone’s Monday calendar for the last nearly 13 years.

Of course, I look forward eagerly to meet him when he comes to the U.S., which I hope will be soon because many of his supporters are asking me for a date certain on his visit. Some even say they want to know so that they could get good deals on air tickets to come and see him wherever he decides to speak after his arrival in the U.S.

The fact of the matter is that I have no information on when PM Abiy will visit the U.S. I believe an official announcement will be made whenever final arrangements are made.

The old saw is, “Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” All I can say to PM Abiy is that the hearts of the legions of his supporters in America are growing fonder by the day!

Second, regarding my support and defense of PM Abiy, I have previously stated that I waited patiently for 13 years to see a young Ethiopian leader like Abiy Ahmed to rise out of the darkness of tyranny and make Ethiopia once again the Land of 13-Months of Sunshine. People used to laugh at me in my face when I talked endlessly about Ethiopia’s Cheetah Generation coming to the rescue of Ethiopia. They said I was naïve, detached from the Ethiopian reality because I have not been there in so long. They say I just don’t know Ethiopia’s youth. Ethiopia’s youth generation is lost in the pursuit of cash and flash. I am wasting my time obsessing about a lost generation.

But I never lost faith in Ethiopia’s youth or their power to redeem Ethiopia. Never. In a September 2016 interview, I stated exactly what I thought of Ethiopia’s youth. I even coined the slogan, “Ethiopia’s youth united can never be defeated.”

In the end, I was proven right. Ethiopia’s youth emerged triumphant and victorious, and I am blessed to see their leader in Abiy Ahmed.

I believe PM Abiy is a man of goodwill, good faith, good heart and extraordinary intelligence. He is a man of the people who came from a modest background. He is a humble young man in the highest office in the land. He is decisive, courageous and true to his political and moral convictions. He is open-minded and is willing to engage his friends and foes in civilized dialogue any time. He listens before he speaks and never speaks with forked tongue. He says what he means and means what he says. I like his sincere message of peace, reconciliation and dialogue to resolve all differences. I share fully his vision of a New Ethiopia built on the rule of law, respect for human rights, good governance and accountability.

Most importantly, PM Abiy believes in the one earthly thing I believe in the most- ETHIOPIAWINET!

In less than 10 weeks, PM Abiy has managed to bring together Ethiopians who had been put asunder for 27 years into brotherhood and sisterhood.

With respect to my views on the pre-PM Abiy regime, as I have said so many times before, I have no personal animus against Meles Zenawi or the TPLF leadership. In fact, I have stated publicly on a number of occasions that I would have been their No. 1 supporter if they operated on the principle of the rule of law, respected human rights and stopped their politics of division and hate.

In my January 2014 commentary, I wrote that I live by Gandhi’s rule: “Hate the sin and not the sinner.” I believe when we hate the haters, we become their mirror images. We are who we hate. If we hate Meles or his gang as human beings, we become them. If we must hate, it must be their acts and not them as human beings.

I believe MLK’s wise counsel to those struggling in the American civil rights movement in the 1960s is appropriate for Ethiopians today. “In the struggle for human rights and justice, Negros will make a mistake if they become bitter and indulge in hate campaigns. The non-violent Negro is seeking to create the beloved community. He directs his attack on the forces of evil rather than on individuals. The tensions are not between the races, but between the forces of justice and injustice; between the forces of light and darkness.” That is exactly what we should. In the end, we are all Ethiopians regardless of ethnicity, religion. language and region. We can all learn the language of peace and reconciliation. I am in the first grade at the School of Peace and Reconciliation. I have a long way to go, but I will get there, with a cane if I have to, following in the footsteps of Abiy Ahmed and his 75 million youthful followers.

Often, human beings react to external stimuli. Some people bring the beast out of us, other the best. The difference between the two words is a single letter, but there is a world of difference.

I support and defend Abiy Ahmed because he brings out the best in me. Those who have read my writings during the pre-PM Abiy regime have described me as “harsh”, “unforgiving” and even “merciless”. Now they are pleasantly surprised to see the other side of me. I think they like the current version of me, for which I give Abiy Ahmed credit.

On a very personal note, PM Abiy always smiles in his public appearances. How true the saying, “Smile and world smiles with you.”

Kudos, PM Abiy on taking the first step towards peace and reconciliation with Eritrea! God bless!

PEACE, OUT!

Give peace and reconciliation a chance in Ethiopia and in Eritrea.

""Despite the order by the President at Ngamia 8, three police reservists were shot dead and livestock stolen at Lokori Ward where the first four oil trucks were flagged off."" .

pointed out that since the discovery of oil, residents in Turkana South and Turkana East have protected it.

Lokichar resident Robert Epem added:

""There is no way we can be a security threat to the oil we have guarded for years, so specialised and additional security personnel should head to Kapedo and assure our people of security.""

He said they won't allow trucks to leave until the President assure them of their security.

Other residents demanded employment as road marshals to ensure that livestock don't interfere with the smooth transportation of the oil.

Lokichar business people, who camped at Africa Camp Solution from Tuesday night, asked Tullow Oil and the government to ensure locals are prioritised when opportunities arise.

Led by Samuel Lomodo, they claimed that they have even been denied tenders to supply fuel for oil operations. They said the tender was awarded to a government parastatal.

""We want to ensure that drivers in the region

get a good share of jobs,"" he said.

The protesters also demanded that the government give details of their five percent revenue share, which they want channeled to their bank accounts and not directed to development as some leaders want.

It was agreed that the public will get

75 percent through the national government, the county

20 percent and the local community

five percent.

Turkana is the poorest county in Kenya; the Kenya National Statistics office says 88 percent of the people live below the poverty level, compared to 45 percent nationally.

Oil was discovered in Lokichar, 90 kilometres from Lodwar, in 2012, and most locals hope the start of output will accelerate development.

In the view of the authority this move forms part of series of initiatives aimed at increasing public confidence in the authority and public sector procurement.



At the launch of the PPA’s supplier registration portal in Accra yesterday, Chief Executive Officer of the authority, A.B. Adjei said “No Registration, No Government Contract.”



According to Mr Adjei, though section 22 of the PPA Act, as amended provides that a tenderer in public procurement must possess the necessary professional and technical qualifications and competence, financial resources and managerial capabilities, these requirements have not been observed.



To ensure these requirements were adhered to, Mr Adjei said there was the need for the PPA to assert itself as an authority in the application of section 3(p) of the Act that mandates the authority to develop and maintain a comprehensive supplier data base that can support effective policy formulation and decision making such as the process of debarment of suppliers and other service provider support systems.



“In view of this the PPA wishes to bring to the attention of the general public that effective yesterday Monday June 11, 2018, all suppliers, contractors and consultants interested in participating in government tenders must as a matter of law register with valid documents as per supplier qualification requirement of section 22 of Act 663 [PPA Act] as amended on our newly developed centralised supplier registration portal available on www.ppaghana.org”, Mr Adjei announced.



The registration cost, he said has been categorised into two – GH¢300 for local firms and US$200 for foreign entities – using any of their approved electronic systems.



“We wish to assure the public that these documentations will be taken through a rigorous vetting process for verification and validation to establish their credibility to engage in government of Ghana tenders and execute contracts”, Mr Adjei stated.



The mandatory eligibility documents include business registration certificates, valid Value Added Tax registration, Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) registration, Ministries of Works and Housing and Roads and Highways and labour (where applicable) certificates.



As part of the benefits to both suppliers and government, Mr Adjei said suppliers will be relieved of the burden of multiple registrations at various procuring entities which eventually increases their cost of doing business and adding that suppliers enlisted on the portal will also have the added advantage of receiving electronic push notifications of tender notices relevant to their areas of business as indicated in the portal.



In a ten minutes demonstration on how one can get registered onto the portal, an applicant first visit the PPA website, creates a user account, log in, choose if the firm is a local or foreign company, following which supplier number is generated for payment and is instantly listed on the portal as a recognized firm by the PPA.



“This supplier registration process is a strategic initiative to prepare the nation for the soon to be rolled out Electronic Government Procurement system”, he stressed.

105,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-examines-leave-no-one-behind-reflections-in-vnrs/,"Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Examines 'Leave No One Behind' Reflections in VNRs,"29 June 2018: Analysts from the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) report that they are encouraged by countries’ engagement with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process so far, even though the presentations made at the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), for the most part, only “met minimum requirements for action on the goals.” The ODI briefing note also finds that the dearth and diversity of reporting on “leave no one behind” (LNOB) mean that trends, approaches and lessons of success and failure have been difficult to identify.



The briefing note titled, ‘What Do Analyses of Voluntary National Reviews for Sustainable Development Goals Tell Us About Leave No One Behind?,’ written by Moizza Binat Sarwar and Susan Nicolai, examines the VNRs based on 22 publications of various organizations and experts that analyzed the VNRs in 2016 and 2017, as well as the UN Secretary-General’s voluntary common reporting guidelines for countries to use in presenting their experiences at the HLPF. The authors note that the 2017 update to the Secretary-General’s guidelines strengthened the call for reporting on LNOB. The guidelines also stress the importance of highlighting SDG implementation challenges, in order for the HLPF to help “troubleshoot” common implementation problems.

VNR reports tend to overflow with data, without any real effort to interpret them in reference to SDG Goals, targets and indicators.

Among commonalities in the publications examined, Sarwar and Nicolai note that while the VNRs show governments’ commitment to the SDGs generally, there is little evidence of political leadership at the national level, “which is crucial for coordinating work across the goals.” However, they say, in a number of VNRs, the political importance of the SDGs is evident considering that responsibility for steering the SDGs is assigned to executive-level offices. The authors also outline a “varied understanding of institutionalization,” adding that most VNRs have only “loosely” followed the UN Secretary-General’s guidelines, and there is a lack of standardization in content. They explain that some countries referred to setting up specific agencies and committees to deal with the SDGs, others discussed institutionalization in terms of alignment with existing national priorities, and some outlined processes for monitoring and evaluating implementation. On progress, the brief stresses that VNR reports often overflow with data, without any real effort to interpret them in reference to SDG Goals, targets and indicators.

The note outlines two angles through which LNOB has been approached in VNRs, namely: the inclusion of this principle in stakeholder consultations during the review process; and the analysis of VNR content for policies that are planned and implemented to reach the most vulnerable populations. The briefing notes states that while most VNRs report on government attempts to consult with non-state actors on mainstreaming the SDGs, the majority gives little detail on the nature of their consultations and how inclusive they have been. It says only a few countries have provided details related to the phases of the VNR process where engagement occurred, the specific stakeholders involved and the mechanisms used, and notes that the VNRs contain limited information on policy and programmatic efforts to implement the LNOB principle. It also reports that an ODI stocktake of progress on the LNOB principle in Kenya’s and Nepal’s health sectors and Ghana’s health and education sectors shows how countries can report on a joined-up approach to data, policy, finance and service delivery in “areas integral to meeting SDGs for the poorest.”

The note suggests to: conduct a holistic analysis of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 VNRs to identify how LNOB has evolved particularly for high, middle and low-income countries; delve deeper into the different ways countries are setting up SDG operations to examine how the LNOB commitment is being institutionalized; and to analyze ways countries have allocated financial resources for SDG implementation to help gauge government effort towards LNOB.

In 2018, 47 countries will present their VNRs at the HLPF, during the ministerial segment from 16-18 July. Including VNRs presented during the 2016 and 2017 HLPFs, more than 100 countries will have presented their reviews by the end of the Forum in 2018.

The 5th Global Open Government Summit taking place this week (17-19 July) in Tbilisi, Georgia focusses on civic engagement, fighting corruption and public service delivery. UNDP has supported the Open Government Partnership (OGP) for the past seven years as a multilateral partner. For many countries, the Global Summit will be an opportunity to learn from the diverse experiences of partner countries and reflect on their own commitment to open government.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially Goal 16, emphasizes peace, stability, human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law. At UNDP we are constantly working towards translating this commitment into tangible improvements in people’s lives, measuring what matters at country level and using relevant data to help governments develop national plans, budgets, and discussions that drive implementation of this ambitious goal.

UNDP’s work spans a wide range of institutions, from national parliaments, supreme courts, and national civil services through regional and local administrations working towards open data, open parliaments, gender equality, innovation, anti-corruption, civic engagement and efficient public services in partnership with multiple stakeholders.

To seize on the opportunity presented by SDG 16, UNDP, with funding from USAID and in collaboration with OGP, has supported countries (El Salvador, Georgia, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Tunisia and Uruguay) in engaging actors throughout state and society. This pilot project, Monitoring to Implement Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, aims to strengthen inclusive national processes for monitoring the implementation of SDG 16 by:

Developing and implementing an inclusive monitoring methodology that includes both government and civil society;

Making the monitoring process open and transparent and ensuring that data is publicly accessible;

Using an inclusive approach of engaging the stakeholders not only in monitoring but also in identifying solutions to the challenges revealed through reporting.

As part of its follow-up and review mechanisms, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encourages Member States to ""conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels, which are country-led and country-driven.” These national reviews are expected to serve as a basis for the regular reviews by the annual High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) meeting under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council. HLPFs provide platforms for the countries to present their progress and articulate the challenges they face in implementing SDG 16 among other goals.

Looking to the future, UNDP is committed to hosting national and regional dialogues around OGP priorities, and promoting the development of and follow-up to commitments made in OGP countries. We can provide the required technical support for the development of open government mechanisms, open legislative processes, and access to information using efficient approaches and good practices.

Strengthening core government functions, through more openness to better manage and deliver public resources, is a key strategy to keep people out of poverty. We value our collaboration with the OGP and look forward to further expanding our strategic partnership, which helps to ensure transparency, accountability and inclusion in decision-making during the planning and budgeting phase. Open government helps to bolster the integrity and inclusiveness of government institutions - two essential prerequisites if we are to leave no one behind!

The visit included projects supporting health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, human rights as well as community asset creation and resilience building for food and nutrition security in Bulawayo, Lupane and Binga Districts.

Briefing the UN team on the third-day of the field visit, Ms Vannesa Nkomo, Binga District Nutritionist summed up the rural development programmes in Matebeleland North supported by the United Nations, “are addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to ending poverty (SDG 1), ending hunger (SDG2), achieving universal and quality health (SDG3), quality education (SDG4), improving access to water and sanitation (SDG6), and promoting peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG16).

During the three-day visit, the UN Team met and interacted with Provincial Administrators, District Administrators, representatives of Government Ministries, health and social workers, school principals, teachers, students, farmers and families benefiting from the harmonised social cash transfers (HSCT).

At the end of the three-day field visit, debriefing Local Administration officials in Binga, UN Resident Coordinator Mr. Bishow Parajuli said, “We are happy to note on the contributions the UN supported projects and the cooperation with the local administration, Government Ministries, non-governmental organisations and the communities, particularly in integrating the SDGs into local development projects, including health, education, social protection, human rights, community asset creation and resilience building programmes to enable vulnerable communities not only to achieve their right to development but also to adapt to effects of climate change.” “We equally learned on the need to intensify joint efforts including the engagement of private sector to address remaining challenges of providing pupils with adequate school facilities and to scale-up ongoing development programmes to support the rural communities achieve their local development plans in the shortest time possible,” said Mr. Parajuli.

On 9 July, the team visited United Bulawayo Hospital (UBH) where, through the Global Fund, UNDP supported the construction and provision of fittings for 350 m2 pharmacy cold chain facilities in Tshabalala Clinic, an incinerator at the NatPharm warehouse; and 11 solar installations in clinics in Bulawayo city under the solar for health initiative. United Bulawayo Hospital is a high-volume Antiretroviral site, with about 5000 patients on treatment being supported by Global Fund and other donors. Noting the impressive progress made to complete construction of the pharmacy warehouse, Mr. Georges van Montfort, UNDP Country Director said, “These improvements contribute in improving health services at the referral hospital, including intensifying the ongoing efforts of combating HIV and AIDS.”

HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe has decreased by 24% over the last decade and Zimbabwe is on course to achieve the global 90:90:90 targets by 2020, which currently stands at 74% of people living with HIV know their status, 87% of those who know their status receive treatment and 87% of those on treatment have their viral load suppressed.

The UN team proceeded to Ntabazinduna for a Human rights outreach clinic which was organized to provide information, counselling, legal aid and protection services to vulnerable and at-risk population in Zimbabwe. The initiative is supported by the Embassy of Sweden and the European Union. The IOM Chief of Mission in Zimbabwe, Ms Lily Sanya said, “The project brings together a consortium of 10 Civil Society Organizations, their network of partners and local authorities to contribute to improved dialogue and access to information on human rights and services to rural communities in remote areas. “

On 10 July, the UN team visited the Zimbabwe Resilience Building Fund (ZRBF) project at Tshonkongwe irrigation scheme in Jotsholo Matebeleland North. The 24.4 hectares scheme has 64 farmers, of which 24 are women each cultivating 0.4ha each. The farmers grow various crops including green mealies, maize, Michigan peas, and horticulture crops and market linkages are created to ensure off-take. The ZRBF supported by European Union, UK DFID, Sweden and UNDP targets 830,000 people in 18 rural labour endowed districts in the country. Mr Christopher Moyo, one of the farmers at the irrigation scheme said he makes about US$2 400 a year by selling his produce and with the money he can send his children to school as well as look after his family.

From Tshonkongwe the team went to ward 20 in Lubimbi, Binga where WFP and its partners supported the local community in constructing a dip tank. Kamombo dip tank brings relief to the community that used to drive their cattle for over 15km in one direction to the nearest dip tank. The construction of a dip tank has ensured regular dipping, thus enhancing the quality of cattle that will fetch better prices on the market. Mr. Eddie Rowe, WFP Representative and Country Director said, “since WFP commenced implementation of a multi-year strategic framework, communities are being supported to improve disaster risk reduction in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard characteristics; and building back better in a sustainable manner to achieve Zero hunger.”

On 11 July, the team visited social services that include health, nutrition, WASH, education and child protection. The first stop was at Donga Primary school where UNICEF has worked with the community and government department to build classroom blocks and toilets, a borehole, and provide textbooks, benches and ECD materials. Donga primary, one of the satellite schools being assisted with support from UK DFID, Germany and Global Partnership for education, has an enrolment of more than 200 students. Dr Mohamed Ag Ayoya, UNICEF Representative said, “he was impressed by the energy and dedication shown by the teachers and the parents and underlined that while progress has been made, there was still a lot to be done to make sure the schools are provided with proper facilities and children with the appropriate environment to learn qualitatively.”

The team proceeded to Simatelele clinic where they interacted with the health workers and witnessed mothers and children being assisted with nutrition, growth monitoring and learning about how to prepare nutritious-balanced food using locally available foods. The clinic is assisted under the health development fund (HDF) supported by UK DFID, EU, Sweden and Irish Aid. The last stop was Siachilaba village where the team visited the beneficiaries of the harmonised social cash transfers. The delegation visited 66-year-old Janet Mudimba who is one of the beneficiaries of the cash transfer programme and saw first-hand the positive impact that this programme have had on this chronically labour constrained household. Ms Mudimba is one of the over 300 000 people supported in 23 districts with monthly cash transfers.

The three-day the field visit, which followed the high-level review of the 2016-2020 Zimbabwe UN Development Assistance Framework (ZUNDAF) at mid-point held on 28 June, allowed the UN team to observe first-hand progress made on UN supported development projects within the commitment of the UN System under 2016-2020 ZUNDAF and engage communities to get their perspectives on the results of ongoing and completed UN supported recovery and development projects.

Governments around the world are failing to honour a pledge to reduce extreme inequalities in child survival, malnutrition, education, protection and other development indicators. In 2015, world leaders signed up to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – a set of 2030 targets for eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms. As part of this agreement, governments committed to ensure that the pace of change would be fastest for those left furthest behind. Evidence set out in this report shows that progress to date has been limited, and that SDG monitoring and review is still focusing on average change rather than those who are furthest behind. This neglect of unfair inequalities threatens to derail the entire SDG project.

The leave no one behind pledge: a commitment to progress with equity

The Leave No One Behind pledge lies at the heart of the SDG framework – a commitment ‘to reach the furthest behind first’ and ensure that targets are met for all segments of society. Monitoring and delivering on this promise is not just a matter of equity and fulfilment of fundamental children’s rights. It is also a condition for achieving the 2030 goals. Failure to narrow the gaps between the most marginalised children and the rest of society is acting as a brake on progress.

To illustrate this globally, this report presents inequality trends for five key child poverty indicators – child mortality, malnutrition, child marriage, birth registration and primary education. For each of these, we calculated progress trends for the world’s poorest 20% of households and compared them to global average trends. The world’s poorest households are located in a mix of middle- and low-income countries. The majority – almost a third – are in India, comprising 486 million people. This is followed by Nigeria (127 million), Democratic Republic of Congo (71 million), Indonesia (68 million) and China (63 million).

Across all of the indicators we analysed, we found that inequality is a major barrier to progress, with the world’s poorest households lagging considerably behind global average rates of change. On current trends, we can only expect a marginal or no reduction in these gaps by 2030.

Child survival provides a stark illustration of the challenge. On current trends there will still be more than 4 million deaths of children under the age of five in the year 2030, compared with 5.6 million in 2016. Children in the world’s poorest 20% of households are nearly 40% more likely to die before their fifth birthday than the global average.

Eliminating this wealth gap would save 4.1 million lives between now and 2030. However, social disparities in child survival are narrowing far too slowly. On current trends, the global gap is set to fall by only three percentage points.

In addition to global trends, we looked at what is happening in individual countries, analysing trends for marginalised segments of society including the poorest households, rural areas and girls. Our analysis shows that in 19 of the 45 countries that are off-track for achieving the minimum SDG targets on child mortality for all segments of society, the gap between the poorest children and the national average is not set to close by the end of the century, if at all. 228 million children live in these countries, and they include India and Nigeria, the two countries with the highest numbers of child deaths in the world.

As this report argues, there is an urgent need for governments and aid donors to ensure that progress is not only fast, but also that it is equitable. To achieve this, governments need to understand the extent of the problem. Yet, to date, SDG monitoring is failing to systematically track progress for the furthest-behind groups.

Governments, supported by the international community, must shift their attention from averages to focus on the progress that the children who are furthest behind are making, and the extent to which they are catching up, or converging, with their more advantaged peers.

Inequalities in child survival reflect deeper disparities in access to healthcare and the neglect of major killers. Parents of the poorest children are often unable to meet the costs of health provision. Pneumonia, for example, is the leading cause of child deaths from infectious disease, killing 879,000 children in 2016, overwhelmingly concentrated in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. If diagnosed early, the disease can be treated with antibiotics that cost a mere $0.40.

Pursuing equitable pathways towards universal health coverage is essential, ensuring that everyone, and critically the poorest and most marginalised, can access the good-quality health services they need without financial hardship.

Malnutrition is one of the most important indicators for national progress, providing insight into how much support children receive in their early years. Here, too, social disparities loom large: being born into the world’s poorest 20% of households increases the chance of being stunted by 60% among children under five. Worryingly, the gap between the poorest and the global average is static. Of countries that have sufficient disaggregated data to compare trends, none are on track for achieving the SDG target of ending malnutrition by 2030 for all segments of society. In over two-thirds of these countries, social disparities are either widening or static.

For malnutrition, as for child survival, governments need to address underlying social disparities as a matter of urgency. For the poorest 20% of households the rate of decline needed to achieve the SDG target has to increase ten-fold.

The picture is similarly bleak for the other indicators of child development examined in this report.

Child marriage: Progress for girls in the poorest households needs to accelerate by a factor of 13 to reach the target of ending child marriage by 2030. Girls in this group are 76% more likely to marry before 18 than the global average, and this gap is set to close by a mere three percentage points by 2030. Eliminating this wealth gap would prevent 20 million child marriages over the next 12 years. Of 68 countries with data, none are set to achieve the SDG target for all segments of society by 2030.

Birth registration: If current trends continue, there will still be 101 million children by 2030 across the world under age five who do not officially exist as they were not registered at birth. This undermines their access to essential services and rights, and increases their vulnerability to child marriage and labour. Progress for the poorest households needs to more than double to reach the SDG target of universal registration by 2030. Eliminating the wealth gap between the poorest and the global average would see 28 million more children registered by 2030.

Education: Progress for children in the poorest households needs to more than triple to ensure all children complete primary school by 2030. Eliminating the wealth gap between the poorest and the global average would allow 31 million more children to complete primary school over the next 12 years. However, this gap is set to fall by only 5 percentage points by 2030 if current trends continue. Of the 62 countries that are off track for achieving universal primary school completion for all segments of society, 55 will not see the gap between the poorest and the national average close this century.","For each of these, we calculated progress trends for the world’s poorest 20% of households and compared them to global average trends.

109,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-platform-publisher-lawsuit,"Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,"Is Facebook a publisher? In public it says no, but in court it says yes","Facebook has long had the same public response when questioned about its disruption of the news industry: it is a tech platform, not a publisher or a media company.

But in a small courtroom in California’s Redwood City on Monday, attorneys for the social media company presented a different message from the one executives have made to Congress, in interviews and in speeches: Facebook, they repeatedly argued, is a publisher, and a company that makes editorial decisions, which are protected by the first amendment.

The contradictory claim is Facebook’s latest tactic against a high-profile lawsuit, exposing a growing tension for the Silicon Valley corporation, which has long presented itself as neutral platform that does not have traditional journalistic responsibilities.

The suit, filed by an app startup, alleges that Mark Zuckerberg developed a “malicious and fraudulent scheme” to exploit users’ personal data and force rival companies out of business. Facebook, meanwhile, is arguing that its decisions about “what not to publish” should be protected because it is a “publisher”.

In court, Sonal Mehta, a lawyer for Facebook, even drew comparison with traditional media: “The publisher discretion is a free speech right irrespective of what technological means is used. A newspaper has a publisher function whether they are doing it on their website, in a printed copy or through the news alerts.”

The plaintiff, a former startup called Six4Three, first filed the suit in 2015 after Facebook removed app developers’ access to friends’ data. The company had built a controversial and ultimately failed app called Pikinis, which allowed people to filter photos to find ones with people in bikinis and other swimwear.



Six4Three attorneys have alleged that Facebook enticed developers to create apps for its platform by implying creators would have long-term access to the site’s huge amounts of valuable personal data and then later cut off access, effectively defrauding them. The case delves into some of the privacy concerns sparked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

For years, Facebook has been saying publicly ... that it's not a media company. ​This is a complete 180

Facebook has rejected all claims. Mehta argued in court Monday that Facebook’s decisions about data access were a “quintessential publisher function” and constituted “protected” activity, adding that this “includes both the decision of what to publish and the decision of what not to publish”.

David Godkin, an attorney for Six4Three, later responded: “For years, Facebook has been saying publicly that it’s not a media company. This is a complete 180.”

Questions about Facebook’s moral and legal responsibilities as a publisher have escalated surrounding its role in spreading false news and propaganda, along with questionable censorship decisions.

Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor, said it was frustrating to see Facebook publicly deny that it was a publisher in some contexts but then claim it as a defense in court.

“It’s politically expedient to deflect responsibility for making editorial judgements by claiming to be a platform,” he said, adding, “But it makes editorial decisions all the time, and it’s making them more frequently.”

Facebook may be resistant to embrace its role as a publisher due to stricter laws and regulations outside of the US that could cause the company trouble, Goldman said.

Still, he argued, Facebook should have the right to make these kinds of decisions about data access and predicted that the company would prevail in court: “Facebook should have the power to stop apps like Pikinis … Facebook was far too loose with its data, and now it’s having to clean it up.”

In the Six4Three case, Facebook has also cited Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, US legislation that paved the way for the modern internet by asserting that platforms cannot be liable for content users post on their sites. In court filings, Facebook quoted the law saying providers of a “computer service” should not be “treated as the publisher” of information from others.

“It just strikes me as fundamentally problematic,” said Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. “On one hand, you’re trying to argue you’re this publisher making editorial judgments. But then they turn around and claim they are protected under [Section 230] because they are not publishers.”

Natalie Naugle, Facebook’s associate general counsel for litigation, defended the company’s legal strategy in a statement to the Guardian, saying: “Facebook explained in today’s hearing that we decide what content to make available through our platform, a right protected by Section 230. Like many other technology companies, we rely on the discretion protected by this law to police bad behavior on our service.”

Facebook spokespeople declined to answer questions about its insistence outside of court that it is not a publisher or media entity.

Daphne Keller, of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said Section 230 was designed to allow platforms like Facebook to do some moderation and make editorial decisions without generally being liable for users’ posts: “They need to be able to make discretionary choices about content.”

The law seemed to be on Facebook’s side, she said, but added that it was an unusual case given the focus on app data access while previous cases have centered on more straightforward censorship claims.

Rebecca Tushnet, a Harvard law school professor, said it seemed Facebook was “owning up to the reality that we all see, that it has an important place in the media environment”.

Kathleen Culver, a University of Wisconsin-Madison journalism professor, said Facebook must consider its ethical obligations outside of its legal responsibilities.

But, she added, it was difficult to define Facebook’s media role using traditional terms like publisher: “What we’re navigating is a space where the language we have to date does not match the technology that has now been developed.”","Facebook has long had the same public response when questioned about its disruption of the news industry: it is a tech platform, not a publisher or a media company.

Police and armed Ortega supporters stormed the Monimbo suburb of Masaya city on Tuesday, tearing down cobblestone barricades erected during bloody protests in which at least 277 people have been killed since April.

Speaking from hideouts, leaders of the protests said they were planning demonstrations and would seek more international pressure on Ortega’s government. Hundreds of protesters were in hiding, they said.

“No one surrenders here,” said one of the leaders, who escaped on Tuesday from Monimbo, about 19 miles (30 km) south of Managua, after clashes between pro-Ortega forces carrying automatic weapons and youths wielding home-made mortars.

“This is like a break and we will return,” said the young man, who requested anonymity. He is sharing a house with several others who escaped Tuesday’s clashes.

Human rights group CENIDH said two people were killed on Tuesday in Monimbo, a policeman and a 17-year-old boy. More than 200 people are imprisoned across the country as a result of the protests, the group said.

“President Ortega has shown time and again that he will stop at nothing to crush all those who dare to oppose his government and anyone unfortunate enough to get in the way,” Amnesty International’s Americas Director Erika Guevara Rosas said on Wednesday.

An offensive at the weekend on a university campus that had been a center of protests led to at least one fatality.

The demonstrations against the government of Ortega began in mid-April in reaction to proposed cuts to social security benefits, but the government’s heavy-handed response sparked a wider challenge to Ortega’s rule and mounting international criticism.

Ortega is a former Marxist guerrilla leader who has held elected office since 2007 and also ruled the country from 1979 to 1990. The current violence erupted after years of calm in Nicaragua and is the worst since his Sandinista movement battled U.S.-backed “Contra” rebels in the 1980s. The 39th anniversary of the revolution is on Thursday.

The government has called the protesters terrorists seeking a coup d’etat. Pro-government media posted images on Twitter of masked men in civilian clothes and Sandinista colors armed with assault rifles celebrating the “liberation” of Masaya, which played an important role in the Sandinista revolution.

Authorities have intensified the clamp-down to clear the main protest strongolds. The international community has condemned the government’s actions, but some residents welcomed removal of barriers.

“I have a little store, but since this all started, I have not worked for three months,” said Sagrario Morales, a resident of Monimbo.

“Now I’m happy, I’m so happy, I do not want these wretches to come back,” Morales said.

Various organizations have called for rallies on Wednesday throughout the small country of 6.2 million people.

A peasant farmers organization planned a sit-in at El Chipote prison, near the Pacific coast, to call for the release of two of its imprisoned leaders.

In the city of Granada, protesters planned a demonstration to demand the release of an arrested leader. Another group called for a march in front of a university in Managua.","MANAGUA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Hundreds of opponents of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega are in hiding in safe houses and planning their next steps to push for his resignation after Ortega loyalists, supported by police, took over a stronghold this week.

From Brussels comes Project Fear Mk II, a “preparedness” guide for Europe if there is no deal on Brexit. It is Brussels-speak for a terrorism red alert. It covers such things as passports, air traffic control, financial transfers, military bases, data protection, medicines licensing and all the border clutter we have spent half a century removing. Unlike the remainers’ bloodcurdling Project Fear in 2016, this is not an economic fake forecast. It is frontline reality. It is Brexit as Grand Theft Auto.

Britain’s National Audit Office is joining in. This week it warned that, as of next March, Britons driving on the continent will need new driving permits in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There must be gigantic laybys for traffic jams at Folkestone and staff for “huge bureaucratic delays”. Airbus and Rolls-Royce are already stockpiling spares against a new tariff regime. AstraZeneca is stockpiling medicines. Theresa May is touring the Irish border, like a field-marshal surveying trenches on the Somme.

Do we laugh or cry? I am still laughing, just. The car-crash option is favoured by some leave ideologues. They are technically right that in March a no-deal UK would “crash out” of the EU and revert to World Trade Organization rules. Such anarchy has disruptive appeal to those careless of other people’s jobs, while “taking back control of borders” would meet the leavers’ prime target of stricter immigration control. But the EU allows no new deals with third-party countries, under WTO rules or whatever, until the UK is out next year. In March, ports would swiftly clog up. The movement of people and tourism would plummet. It would be chaos, and even after that “new deals with the rest of the world” could not possibly compensate.

In reality, everyone knowledgeable about Brexit agrees on what will really happen if there is no deal in March. Nothing will change. Planes will keep flying. Ferries will keep loading. Channel Tunnel officials will wave vehicles through. Orders will go out to keep moving, and await further instructions. People at the coalface of the European economy cannot afford the posturing, vanity and idiocy of the Brexit parliament this past week. They have lives to live and mouths to feed. A closed border with the EU, not least in Ireland, would be like closing the Berlin Wall after it had reopened. There would be riots. That is why crashing out would not mean hard Brexit, but rather remain in all but name. When Brexit fantasy hits practical reality, reality will win.

Hard Brexit was surely put to bed by Boris Johnson’s resignation speech in the Commons this week, a confection of negativity and verbosity. He offered no “frictionless” alternative to a customs union with the rest of Europe. The UK may be leaving the EU – for which I believe there is something to be said – but it makes no sense to erect trade barriers between an island and its neighbouring continent. Britain has spent a century moving in the opposite direction. Even in the 1950s, when it dreamed of a greater imperial market, it joined Europe’s free trade zone, forerunner of the present European Economic Area. Hard Brexit is flat-Earthism.

The failure of the House of Commons this week to vote in favour of a customs union, as opposed to May’s botched Chequers plan, was a lost opportunity. Johnson might call the plan a “fantastical Heath Robinson arrangement”, but that was because May changed it to win his support. It is his fault. She should not have bothered. As a result, the opportunity to negotiate a customs union in Brussels from a united, bipartisan base with Labour was scuppered.

The public was promised Brexit, which, as May keeps saying, means Brexit. That is happening. It was also promised frictionless trade, which means frictionless. That is achievable only under a customs union and single market.

As a result of the current shambles, the new Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, must go to Brussels to negotiate “frictionless” on the basis of Chequers, not a simple customs union. The difference is over agreeing tariff collection and regulatory alignment on trading standards. This is all but trivial. Even if the UK were to go for hard Brexit, trade with the EU would still need some such agreement, as would the much-vaunted, largely fantasy, deals with the rest of the world. Talk of Chequers as “vassalage” is ludicrous. Taking back control of trade was always making a mountain of a molehill.

The outcome of Raab’s negotiations will be messier than were he negotiating on the basis of remaining in the EEA. But the destination has to be the same. There may be more bloodletting ahead but, come the autumn, I am sure we will all be in sight of the Norway option. Whatever may one day be agreed on migration – still Brexit’s hard core and still to be negotiated – a customs union between the nations of Europe cannot be avoided.

Prudent government should always be on guard against car crashes. It is not scaremongering to inspect the fenders and check the airbags. But a crash on Brexit will not happen, and even if it did, the outcome would not be “crashing out” of Europe but rather crashing in. The UK is going to leave the EU next spring. That is law. But no one was asked if they wanted to leave Europe’s economic community. We were promised frictionless. If Westminster’s midsummer madness does lead to a car crash, so be it. In the longer run it will make no difference. Keep laughing.","That is why crashing out would not mean hard Brexit, but rather remain in all but name.

New study advocates non-discriminating environment and responsive interventions

MANILA, 24 July 2018 – PhilHealth estimates that one out of seven or around 5.1 million Filipino children are living with disabilities. Yet there is little information on the prevalence of disabilities among Filipino children.

The Situation of Children with Disabilities in the Philippines study addresses this information gap and provides data that will support the development of responsive national programs and services for children with disabilities. Supported by the Australian Embassy, UNICEF, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the report underlined that children with disabilities continue to experience barriers to access basic social services. This is compounded by poverty, lack of data, weak governance and discriminatory attitudes related to disability in general.

Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Amanda Gorely, DSWD Acting Secretary Virginia Orogo, and UNICEF Philippines OIC Representative Julia Rees attended the public presentation of the study.

“Children with disabilities are less likely to attend school, access medical services, or have their voices heard in society. Their disabilities also place them at a higher risk of physical abuse and discrimination, and often exclude them from receiving proper nutrition or humanitarian assistance in emergencies,” Rees said.

UNICEF is working with PhilHealth to develop benefit packages for children with disabilities in the Philippines. UNICEF is also helping establish three children with disability hubs in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Ambassador Gorely expressed support, “The Embassy is pleased to provide assistance to UNICEF and our Philippine Government partners for this important study that helps everyone understand the lives of children with disability and how we can improve their situation. Disability-inclusive development is a priority of Australia’s Foreign Policy, and underpins our engagement on human rights, development assistance and humanitarian action.”

The study, conducted by Development Academy of the Philippines, recommends putting in place a comprehensive service framework for children with disabilities and a strong referral system that integrates the different social services. Addressing financial barriers to social services is also important, as is enhancing the disability inclusiveness of health, education, social welfare and transportation services.

While the Philippines has taken significant steps and continues to address the issues of persons and children with disabilities through laws, community-based services, incentives and social cash transfers, more can be done to ensure their rights are fulfilled.

“Australia is proud to be one of the largest donors to the Philippines on social protection, and we are ready to assist through our existing partnerships with DSWD and UNICEF,” said Ambassador Gorely.

113,https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/scared-public-and-now-no-privacy-human-rights-and-public-health-impacts-indonesia-s,"Mon, 02 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,“Scared in Public and Now No Privacy”: Human Rights and Public Health Impacts of Indonesia’s Anti-LGBT Moral Panic - Indonesia,"Summary

On May 21, 2017, police in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, raided the Atlantis gym and sauna, arresting 141 people, most of whom were gay or bisexual men. Ten were ultimately prosecuted under Indonesia’s pornography law. The Atlantis was not just a “gay club,” but a public health outreach center—a well-known hub for HIV education, testing, and counseling among men who have sex with men (MSM).

In the media, the raid was just the latest “anti-LGBT incident.” Since early 2016, many senior government officials had made that four-letter acronym a toxic symbol, the focus of an unprecedented rhetorical attack on Indonesian sexual and gender minorities. Officials used the letters to signal a group of societal outsiders; some even construed the visibility of “LGBT” as threat to the Indonesian nation itself.

There were at least six similar raids on private spaces in 2017, and more in early 2018. Each followed a pattern: vigilantism against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) people provided social sanction for abusive police action; vague and discriminatory provisions in the law empowered authorities to violate the privacy rights of people presumed to be LGBT; the venues raided were places where LGBT Indonesians believed they could gather safely and privately, to learn about health issues, make friends, and build community. All told, police in Indonesia apprehended at least 300 LGBT people in 2017 alone because of their sexual orientation and gender identity—a spike from previous years and the highest such number ever recorded in Indonesia. The pattern of these raids suggests a systematic crackdown on LGBT rights, and their impact portends a public health crisis.

This report—based largely on 48 in-depth interviews in Java, Kalimantan, and Sumatra in 2017 with victims and witnesses, health workers, and activists—updates a Human Rights Watch report from August 2016 that documented the sharp rise in anti-LGBT attacks and rhetoric that began in January of that year. It provides an account of major incidents between November 2016 and March 2018 and examines the far-reaching impact of this anti-LGBT “moral panic” on the lives of sexual and gender minorities and the serious consequences for public health in the country.

While Indonesia has made inroads on the spread of HIV in a number of areas, HIV rates among MSM have increased five-fold since 2007, according to government and UNAIDS data. And while the majority of new HIV infections in Indonesia occur through heterosexual transmission, one-third of new infections occur in MSM. In major urban centers such as Denpasar in Bali and Jakarta, the MSM epidemic is even more prevalent with nearly one in three MSM infected with HIV. One particularly troubling aspect of the anti-LGBT panic, detailed below, is that public health outreach to such populations has become far more difficult, making wider spread of the disease more likely.

As noted above, conditions in Indonesia today can be traced to a nationwide anti-LGBT “moral panic” that began in early 2016. Over the course of several weeks in January and February 2016, anti-LGBT statements ranging from the absurd to the apocalyptic echoed through Indonesia’s media: at a maternal health seminar, a mayor warned young mothers off instant noodles—their time and attention, he said, should be given instead to nutritious cooking and teaching their children how not to be gay. The National Child Protection Commission issued a decree against “gay propaganda” and called for censorship. The national professional association for psychiatrists proclaimed same-sex sexual orientation and transgender identities as “mental illnesses.” The Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s largest Muslim organization, called for criminal penalties for LGBT behavior and activism, and forced “rehabilitation” for LGBT people. And perhaps most perniciously, Indonesia’s minister of defense labeled LGBT rights activism a proxy war on the nation led by outsiders:

""It's dangerous as we can't see who our foes are, but out of the blue everyone is brainwashed—now the [LGBT] community is demanding more freedom, it really is a threat…. In a nuclear war, if a bomb is dropped over Jakarta, Semarang will not be affected—but in a proxy war, everything we know could disappear in an instant—it's dangerous.""

Veteran Indonesia expert Professor Edward Aspinall observed that Indonesia’s anti-LGBT crisis, “[is] one of those issues in this age of very rapid electronic media and social media where it really just spiraled to become this major moral panic to engulf the country.”

That outpouring of intolerance sparked new legislative proposals—by independent groups as well as lawmakers—to censor LGBT content in the media, end “LGBT campaigning” (without defining it), and criminalize adult consensual same-sex conduct. One of the most high-profile efforts in this regard took place at the Constitutional Court. In July 2016, petitioners led by the Family Love Alliance, an anti-LGBT coalition based in the city of Bogor, petitioned the Constitutional Court to effectively amend clauses in Indonesia’s criminal code on adultery, rape, and sex with a minor to criminalize all sex outside of marriage and all sex between persons of the same sex, regardless of age. While the petition failed, the battle has now moved into the house of representatives with similar proposals put forward by various parties. The government representative on the parliamentary task force on revising the criminal code has expressed opposition to outright criminalization of same-sex conduct. However, sex outside of marriage remains a criminal offense in the draft, and the speaker of the house of representatives has stated publicly that, “We must not fear or succumb to outside pressure and threats that banning LGBT practices will decrease foreign tourism. What we must prioritize is the safety of nation's future, particularly the safety of our youth from influences that go against norms, culture and religion.”

The anti-LGBT moral panic simultaneously spilled over from government institutions into wider society. In January 2018, the Twitter feed of the Indonesian air force went on a bizarre and hateful anti-LGBT screed. The air force has failed to publicly provide any details about the incident or to confirm or deny its support for such discriminatory invective. There were also social media protests and threats of boycotts against Starbucks in Indonesia for its CEO’s 2013 statement in support of same-sex marriage, and Unilever for its distribution of a rainbow ice cream product.

In perhaps the most telling indicator of how politically superficial but socially profound the anti-LGBT campaign had been, opinion data trends showed peculiar results. A 2016 opinion poll showed that 26 percent of Indonesians disliked LGBT people—making them the most disliked group in the country, overtaking the historical placeholders: communists and Jewish people. A similar poll in 2017 showed an even greater proportion of Indonesians responding negatively to questions about LGBT people. Additionally, the survey found that more Indonesians feared LGBT people than could define the acronym or the population it referred to.

A handful of senior officials have made statements or taken initial steps in support of some protections for LGBT people’s basic rights. In September 2017, in response to a request from the National Commission on Human Rights, the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) announced that it had rescinded a job notice that barred LGBT applicants. However, the AGO undermined that defense of LGBT rights by suggesting homosexuality was a “mental illness.” In February 2018, national police chief Tito Karnavian ordered an investigation into a series of raids on transgender-owned beauty parlors in Aceh province, resulting in the local police apologizing. The chief who oversaw the raids was later demoted. Most importantly, in October 2016, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo publicly defended the rights and dignity of LGBT Indonesians.

These statements and actions, however, have not been followed with more systematic efforts to stop discrimination and abuse. President Jokowi, for example, has yet to take any steps to penalize government officials implicated in fomenting anti-LGBT discrimination, and his statements have not deterred senior government officials from making anti-LGBT statements or stopped police from conducting discriminatory raids on LGBT venues. In December 2017, Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin called for LGBT people to be “nurtured, not shunned.” However, Saifuddin’s tolerance came with limits: he called for “religious adherents” to “embrace and nurture” LGBT people by reacquainting them with religious teaching, while in the same statement asserting that, “there is no religion that tolerates LGBT action.”

Meanwhile, throughout 2017 police raided saunas, night clubs, hotel rooms, hair salons, and private homes on suspicion that LGBT people were inside. The raids sometimes were preceded by police surveillance of social media accounts to discover an event’s location, and at times featured officers marching unclothed detainees in front of the media, public humiliation, and moralizing presentations of condoms as evidence of illegal behavior.

The vitriolic anti-LGBT rhetoric from public officials that began in early 2016 effectively granted social sanction and political cover to violence and discrimination—carried out by both citizen vigilantes and state authorities. The unabated stream of hateful anti-LGBT messaging from government officials and institutions has also contributed to a public health crisis.

Most new HIV infections in Indonesia occur through heterosexual transmission. However, one-third of new infections occur in MSM and HIV rates in that population have spiked in recent years. Abusive and discriminatory police actions including raids on private spaces and the use of condoms as evidence of purported crimes has harmed HIV education and outreach services by instilling fear among sexual and gender minority communities who urgently need such services. Meanwhile, public health data show that HIV prevalence rates among MSM are increasing dramatically. Moreover, while the prevalence of HIV in other key affected populations (KAPs) has largely remained stable, the prevalence of HIV among MSM has increased significantly and rapidly—with 25 percent of MSM infected with HIV in 2015 compared to only 8.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2007. HIV prevalence among transgender women (waria) was reported at 22 percent in 2011 and 2015.

The Indonesian government’s failure to protect the rights of LGBT people represents a betrayal of fundamental human rights obligations. The crisis is also isolating Indonesia from its neighbors and attracting broader international opprobrium.

ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights in January 2018 reacted to the anti-LGBT crisis by warning Indonesia of its “blatant violation of all Indonesians’ right to privacy and their fundamental liberties.” After a February 2018 visit to Indonesia, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that “LGBTI Indonesians already face increasing stigma, threats and intimidation” and said: “The hateful rhetoric against this community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions.”

In July 2017, Indonesia indicated that it would reject all recommendations aimed to protect the rights of LGBT people at its Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the process in which every United Nations member state has its human rights record reviewed every four years. However, in September the government announced it would accept proposals to “take further steps to ensure a safe and enabling environment for all human rights defenders,” including LGBT activists. It also committed to implement the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and give priority to equality and nondiscrimination—including for LGBT people. Government health authorities have made similar pledges to eliminate human rights-based barriers to equitable access to HIV services. Given the government’s track record on this issue so far, implementation will be key.

As a first step, the police should halt all raids on private spaces, investigate those that have taken place, and punish the perpetrators and their chain of command. Police should instead be instructed to protect gatherings of sexual and gender minorities from attack by vigilantes and militant Islamist groups.

Indonesia’s laws need to be adjusted as well. The government should amend the anti-pornography law, which currently construes same-sex conduct as “deviant.” The government should make it clear to parliamentarians who propose criminalizing sex outside of marriage and same-sex conduct that such measures violate the constitution and Indonesia’s international human rights obligations.

The courage to confront the anti-LGBT moral panic should come from the highest ranks of Indonesian government. Indeed, it was President Jokowi himself who said that “the police must act” against any moves by bigoted groups or individuals to harm LGBT people or deny them their rights, and that “there should be no discrimination against anyone.” He needs to take further action on this pledge, including by immediately ordering an end to police raids that unlawfully target LGBT people, investigating the raids of 2017 and 2018, and dissolving any regional and local police units dedicated to targeting LGBT people.","The pattern of these raids suggests a systematic crackdown on LGBT rights, and their impact portends a public health crisis.

However, in September the government announced it would accept proposals to “take further steps to ensure a safe and enabling environment for all human rights defenders,” including LGBT activists."

“This was a public crime that does not go away with the passage of time and therefore it makes no sense to close the case,” Iranian Canadian attorney Hossein Raeesi told the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on July 19.

“If the private plaintiffs have agreed to stop pursuing the case, that’s fine but if it means that the authorities are going to stop looking for the perpetrators, that would be unlawful and unreasonable,” said Raeesi.

“The court and the police should keep the case open and the judiciary and security agencies should seriously pursue it,” he added.

During the autumn of 2014, as many as 10 women were badly disfigured in Iran by men who threw acid at them. According to eyewitnesses, the victims were attacked for wearing what the men considered improper hijabs.

The attacks took place as Iran’s Parliament was debating the Plan to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice, which became law in June 2015. It allows citizens to “verbally” confront people accused of committing vices.

Article 4 states, “Promoting virtue and preventing vice is carried out verbally, in writing or by heartfelt action. The verbal and written aspect is the responsibility of all people as well as the government, and the actionable aspect is the sole responsibility of the government and carried out within the parameters of the law.”

Article 6 states, “No person or group has the right to insult, strike, injure or kill in the name of promoting virtue and preventing vice. Violators will be punished according to the Islamic Penal Code.”

In October 2014, Isfahan’s Friday prayer leader Mohammad Taghi Rahbar stated that women with “bad hijab” should be confronted by more than just words. The words of Friday prayer leaders in Iran are often considered by the faithful as equal to or more important than the law.

A year after the attacks, the mother of one of the victims told CHRI that the authorities had not publicly released any information about the results of their investigations and warned families not to speak to foreign media.

“Whenever we try to follow up on our daughter’s case, they say they are working on it but so far they have not given any information. The first few weeks they were very active on the case, but now they have slowed down a lot. It seems like they have forgotten about it. We ran around a lot to this and that ministry to be compensated for our daughter’s medical expenses. Now our most important wish is that the perpetrators be punished for the acid attacks,” she said.

Although no one has been convicted for illegally attacking the women, a number of civil rights activists have been prosecuted for protesting against the attacks including human rights activist Ali Shariati, who served 16 months in prison before he was released in February 2018.

Civil rights activist Mahdieh Golru was also arrested in October 2014 a day after she attended a rally to protest acid attacks on women in Iran’s Isfahan Province.

She was held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison’s Ward 2-A, under the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), until her release in January 2015.","Nearly four years after a series of acid attacks on women in the Iranian city of Isfahan, the judiciary has closed the cases without any convictions while pledging to compensate the victims.

Katrina Henderson is a young mum who had disengaged from school as a teenager.

Were it not for a special class at South West TAFE, she would likely not be back completing her high school education.

The Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) young parents' class gives school-age mums and dads a chance to finish their year 10, 11 and 12-equivalent in a supported setting, with a qualified childcare worker in the same room as the students.

This year only mothers are enrolled.

This class offers solutions not only to young parents like her, but it is helping to solve a problem Ms Henderson sees in her home town of Warrnambool.

""There's kids in Warrnambool going to school without lunches,"" Ms Henderson said.

Each semester the young parents' class makes and delivers 1,000 cheese and Vegemite sandwiches to local primary and secondary schools.

The sandwiches are stored in school freezers and discreetly handed out to students who come to school without lunch.

For the students in this class, the school lunch project is about parents helping other parents.

""You kind of feel bad for all the parents that can't afford lunches for their kids,"" Ms Henderson said.

That parenting connection made the project an easy sell for class teacher Sharna Westley, who has been teaching the young parents' class for more than seven years.

Having a child carer in the classroom allows these young women do schoolwork and keep their babies nearby ( ABC South West Victoria: Emily Bissland

""Because we work with young people who have children themselves, this is of particular interest to them,"" Ms Westley said.

Some of their kids go to the schools that we support, so it's quite important to them.""

She also saw the value in giving her students an opportunity to help others.

""It doesn't get spoken about much, but they do still feel judged about being a young parent,"" Ms Westley said.

""Sometimes you've just got to give back and feel useful to feel good, and with this, they feel really useful.

For Bridget Beverage, who has been enrolled since giving birth to her first of four children in 2012, finally passing VCAL will be important to role model to her children.

""I just want to prove to the kids that I can actually pass something"" she explained, expressing relief that she was getting closer to her goal.

Teachers handing over their lunch

The contribution that Ms Henderson and her classmates have been making is not lost on the schools they help out.

""We were making these sandwiches ourselves,"" Michelle Miller, Principal of Warrnambool East Primary School, said.

""There were situations where teachers were even handing their lunch over — we would never ever want a kid to go hungry.

""So it's absolutely a fantastic service to have loaves and loaves of sandwiches come in.""

One thousand cheese and vegemite sandwiches were made in just 2 hours with about 8-10 volunteers. This is organised every semester by the Young Parents class at South West TAFE. ( ABC South West Victoria: Emily Bissland

Ms Miller loves the fact that the school lunch project has a dual benefit.

""I just think it's fantastic for those young mums to be putting in to help other people,"" she said

""I love that cycle of helping.""

Hungry kids can't concentrate

Educators say that being hungry impacts on how kids learn, their concentration levels, mental health, behaviour in class and friendships.

""We identified in Beyond the Bell that food scarcity and hunger are a real barrier to young people being able to engage successfully in their education,"" said Rahman Gray - Manager of School and Community Programs at Brophy Youth and Family Services.

""If people's basic nourishment and safety isn't being looked after then you can't go through those high-level learning processes.""

Mr Gray said he was pleased that this lunch project allowed school welfare staff to get on with the more important part of their job.

""Anecdotally, a lot of school wellbeing staff are reporting that a major part of their job is actually spent securing food,"" he said.

""This program liberates them from having to produce lunches, so that they could focus on the pastoral part of their roles.""

Hungry children in the 'lucky country': Nation-wide issue

Research by Foodbank shows that this is not an isolated problem, with 22 per cent of Australian children having experienced food insecurity in the previous 12 months.

Australia's high living costs were named in the report as the main cause of food insecurity, especially for renters.

Lyndon Galea founded Eat Up Australia in 2012 after reading a news article about kids going to school hungry in his home town of Shepparton. ( ABC South West Victoria: Emily Bissland

When young Shepparton go-getter Lyndon Galea heard that kids in his town were going hungry, he was shocked into doing something.

""I was just totally unaware that this was an issue in Australia at all,"" said Galea, who is now the Founded Director of Eat Up Australia.

""I just thought in a country as lucky as ours that that wouldn't be the case'

That is how Mr Galea became the founding director of Eat Up Australia.

He started making sandwiches at home but the not-for-profit enterprise now regularly delivers sandwiches to 265 schools across Victoria.

""The volume increases each term as we support more and more schools, however we provided 58,543 lunches last term,"" Mr Galea said.

""So we're on track to make and deliver over 200,000 lunches in Victoria this year, perhaps even more.""

Recently, Eat Up have come on board to grow the school lunch project in Warrnambool so that fewer kids will go without.

Eat Up has recently begun supporting Warrnambool's grass-roots efforts to make and deliver sandwiches. ( ABC South West Victoria: Emily Bissland

""We didn't realise it was going to be so big to be honest, it's sort of growing faster than we can keep up with,"" VCAL teacher Sharna Westley said.

South West TAFE will be looking for community and staff volunteers to increase their people power, but so far there has been an abundance of food donations to keep the Warrnambool program running, so they've barely touched their $2000 of funding.

A local milk factory donates cheese and butter, with Food Share providing the bread, and local a supermarket donating plastic wrap.

""This town is like that"" Ms Westley said.","Kids who go to school without lunch are no longer going hungry, thanks to the contribution of a class of young mums who have gone back to school after having babies.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's chief of staff announced the remarks on Twitter, saying they were made during a meeting with leaders of more than 50 national and regional parties, including ones from overseas, who demanded reforms in election law.



A multiparty democracy would need strong institutions that respect human rights and rule of law, Abiy said, according to his chief of staff.



The 42-year-old prime minister has announced sweeping reforms since taking office in April, including the release of opposition figures from prison and the embrace of a peace deal that led to the surprising restoration of diplomatic ties this month with longtime rival Eritrea.



Just months ago Ethiopia, a nation of more than 100 million people, faced widespread anti-government protests demanding wider freedoms, with the U.N. human rights chief and others expressing concern over hundreds of reported deaths and tens of thousands of people detained.



Ethiopia's ruling coalition, which has been in power since 1991 and along with affiliated parties holds every seat in parliament, came up with Abiy after former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped aside early this year. Abiy notably doesn't come from the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, a party in the ruling coalition that has been the dominant force in government for most of the past 27 years.



Since taking office the new prime minister has surprised Ethiopians by acknowledging past torture by security forces, announcing the opening-up of the state-run economy and suggesting that his own position should have term limits.

Udayakumar’s mother Prabhavathi Amma said no other parent should suffer her fate. No court would pardon the men in uniform who killed her son for no fault of his.

Teary-eyed and mobbed by journalists, the 67-year-old woman looked up at the heavens with folded palms and said that “God has listened to a bereaved mother’s mournful prayers. They killed my son during an Onam 13 years ago. Now they will spend their Onam in prison. They killed an innocent man. Now they will spend their days under the sentence of death,” she said.

Prabhavathi Amma thanked the press for the outpouring of social support their coverage of the case had triggered. She singled out E.K. Raju of the Communist Party of India as her staunchest supporter.

Prabhavathi Amma’s determined and protracted battle for justice had caused her to become an almost iconic figure for human rights activists. Her gritty and fund-starved struggle had resonated strongly among the public.

Born into poverty, Prabhavathi Amma was abandoned by her husband when she was pregnant with her only son, Udayakumar. She washed dishes and worked as a helper at a school to provide for her child. They lived in a rented house in Karamana. Udayakumar worked with a scrap merchant. She said she always selected his shirts. On September 27, 2005, the police arrested Udayakumar along with one Suresh Kumar, a person with a criminal history of petty theft, on the suspicion that they were thieves.

CBI probe

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) found that officers tortured Udayakumar in custody to extract a confession that the cash they found on him were proceeds from the sale of loot. The money turned out to be his festival wages.

Human rights activists welcomed the verdict and said they hoped the trial would serve as a template for several such cases.","Her gritty, fund-starved struggle resonates among publicUdayakumar’s mother Prabhavathi Amma said no other parent should suffer her fate.

All six contributors – sometimes accompanied by guest bloggers – are working on solving the problems of our time. Everything to make Tomorrow Good. This Sunday, it‘s Auke Hoekstra’s turn, about creating abundance. Here are all the previously published columns.

One of the most revered reports in environmental circles is the 1972 study “Limits to Growth”. It intoned our civilization would quickly collapse if we did not limit ourselves and then drew the conclusion that we must aim for a condition “designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied” so we can transition “from growth to equilibrium”.

Now the simulation behind the model did not predict “imminent global disaster” unless you count somewhere between 2050 and 2100 as imminent. It was surprisingly accurate and we are still moving along the disastrous “business as usual” scenario it predicted. It actually inspired me to choose a career in simulation. It’s the conclusion I criticize: its focus on basic needs instead of growth was deeply unpopular and utterly counterproductive in my opinion. I think the root problem is that it equates growth with waste. And I think it’s a shame many people in the environmental movement are still stuck in this mindset. I propose to stop moaning and get clever. I propose we actually get stuff done by using a positive motivating message: there are no limits to growth and we can create abundance by eliminating waste and suffering.

“There are no limits to growth and we can create abundance by eliminating waste and suffering”

Let’s look at how to do that for the main limits discussed in this and most other environmental reports: population, food, energy, and goods.

Population

By aiming for abundant healthcare and contraception we can eliminate the waste of human life and suffering inherent in overpopulation.

Surprisingly many people still adhere to Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) theory that population growth will only be limited by abstinence or – more realistically – starvation. (He thought it was God’s way to teach virtuous behaviour.) But study after study shows that once you lift people out of poverty and give them healthcare and contraception the population quickly stabilizes. There are currently 7.6 billion people on this planet and if current trends hold it will stabilize at 11 billion in 2100. One of the best things we can do for the environment is step up our efforts to reduce suffering because then the world population would stabilize at around 8 billion (UN medium and low scenarios).

Food

By aiming for abundant food, we can eliminate the waste and suffering that dominates our current bioindustry.

Humanity is depleting its aquifers and topsoil, demolishing forests and causing incredible suffering. (Did you know pigs are more intelligent and social than cats and dogs?) And as our taste for meat grows, things get worse because the conversion from plants to animals has an efficiency of around 10%. But we can change all that if we adopt modern farming techniques and grow our meat in a lab instead of on an animal. By eliminating the suffering and waste inherent in our current bio-industry we could create food that is healthier, tastier, abundant and cheap. What’s not to like?

Energy

By aiming for abundant energy, we can eliminate the waste and suffering inherent in our current fossil fuel-based system.

Fossil fuels are extremely wasteful. We are burning in a few hundred years what took hundreds of millions of years to get created and the resulting CO2 is heating up our planet. But we can eliminate that waste if we harvest solar power more directly. For example, by using solar panels and wind turbines. (By the way: did you know solar panels are about 50 to 100 times more efficient than biofuels and could give us 10 thousand times the energy we currently need?) Added bonus: millions of lives saved each year because of healthier air and we no longer have to placate governments that are abusing human rights and exporting terrorism.

Goods

By aiming for abundant goods, we can eliminate the waste and suffering inherent in our current “use it and throw it away” approach to manufacturing.

I think deep down we all know that throwing stuff away without reusing it is a wasteful and temporary affair. And we’ve all seen the pictures of animals (from whales to albatrosses) dying because their stomachs are filled with plastic. Limiting ourselves is once again not a solution. It just makes the problem less bad. Instead, we should aim for radical and total re-use. This one is hardest but will lead to higher quality products, a lot less waste lying around and, in the end, cheaper products. (Tesla claims it will re-use its batteries, partly because it’s cheaper than buying the materials again.)

Conclusion

And there you have it: my “No Limits to Growth” proposal. In a nutshell:

Make health care and contraception abundant so fewer people die and the human population quickly stabilizes.

Make energy abundant by harvesting it directly from the sun instead of first turning it into plants or even fossils that we then burn.

Make food abundant by harvesting it directly from plants instead of first turning it into animals that we then kill and eat.

Make goods abundant by reusing the stuff they are made up from instead of turning it into pollution.

Learn, play, have fun!

This is the first time that the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government faced such a motion. The motion secured 126 votes in favour and 325 against. There were no abstentions.

While the Shiv Sena stayed away from the proceedings, BJD walked out of the House. Though the no-confidence motion was essentially brought by the TDP over what they call non-allocation of adequate funds to Andhra Pradesh, the discussion expanded to various issues ranging from Rafale deal to mob violence.

The House had to be adjourned twice over war of words between members. It also witnessed dramatic 'hug diplomacy' of Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Here are the live updates:

11.30 p.m.

Mr. Modi tweets: “NDA has the confidence of the Lok Sabha and the 125 crore people of India. I thank all the parties that have supported us in the vote today. Our efforts to transform India and fulfil the dreams of our youth continue. Jai Hind!”

Lok Sabha | 11.08 p.m.

The question is put to vote again after the official’s explanation. The numbers are in: Ayes 126, Noes 325, Total 451. That means the motion is defeated.

Chair's announcement awaited.

And the Chair announces that subject to corrections the numbers are: Ayes 126, Noes 325. And the motion is rejected. House adjourned till Monday.

The Narendra Modi government has survived a no-trust motion.

Lok Sabha | 11 p.m.

The House is preparing to vote on the no-confidence motion. Members will be allotted their lobbies. After that the Lok Sabha Secretary will explain the procedure to vote.

Ms. Mahajan announces that the lobbies are cleared.

Question is asked. After the voice vote, now division is announced.

After a false result, the Secretary-General is now explaining the procedure.

According to the numbers flashed for a moment: There were 10 Ayes, and 8 Noes with no abstentions.

The numbers shown at the Lok Sabha display during voting on the no-confidence motion on July 20, 2018.

Lok Sabha | 10.45 p.m.

TDP leader Kesineni Srinivas is called to speak. He credits Mr. Modi as the greatest actor actor of our time. Protests from Treasury benches.

Minister Ananth Kumar wants some words to be expunged. Chair reminds the TDP member to ask only clarifications, if any.

“Both BJP and Congress are responsible for the unscientific bifurcation of A.P., ” he says recalling the events at the 15th Lok Sabha during the passage of the A.P. Bifurcation Bill.

He repeats his claim that Mr. Modi is a great drama artist, triggers protest.

Motion put to vote.

Speaker says Noes have it. Asks the lobbies to be cleared.

Mr. Modi now moves on to talk about bank loans and NPAs. Numbers are being reeled out amid slogans of “We Want Justice”. Though not shown by Lok Sabha TV we can understand the protest is by members from A.P.

“I want to tell you about the NPA problem. Much before Internet Banking, Congress Party invented Phone Banking and this caused the NPA mess. A phone call would get loans for their cronies and the nation suffered.”

Prime Minister now refers to notes to talk about the “damage” the UPA govt did to capital goods sector. Possibly the protests are at the Well of the House. Though it was not shown, we can see hands going up in the frame showing the PM.

Mr. Modi, who is known for his extempore speeches, continues to refer notes while talking about economics numbers.

If the UPA govt was allowed to continue in 2014, the country would have gone from bad to worse, the Prime Minister implies.

Mr. Modi seems to be rushing through his speech. From a composed address, it now appears he is reading out from a prepared text.

Yes, he is reading out from a text.

“Any instance of violence brings shame to the nation. I will once again urge the state governments to punish those who indulge in violence,” says the PM. “This Government stands with the Muslim women in their quest for justice.”

“India is seeing the record pace at which roads are being built, villages are being connected, i-ways are being built, railways development is happening,” he says. Lok Sabha TV shows Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

“Poora karo, poora karo,” slogans are being shouted by the protesting members apparently from A.P.

The Prime Minister now turns to statistics on the job opportunities to be created by medical and legal professions.

It looks like a ritual now: PM gives out numbers, Treasury benches respond with a feeble, tired desk thumping.

Sector after sector is creating lakhs and lakhs of jobs, the PM says. “I am quoting independent reports, not sarkari numbers,” he says. Curiously he sticks to 125 crore, when the population is well beyond 132 crore.

He concludes his speech.

Lok Sabha | 10.15 p.m.

PM now moves on the SCS and A.P. and then blames the Congress.

“Atal ji created 3 states- Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. It was done peacefully. These states are prospering. The Congress divided Andhra Pradesh and their conduct then was shameful,” he says. “But it's not new. It's been you case since India-Pakistan partition.”

“NDA government is fully committed towards the development of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana” he says. Quotes a TDP MP, without naming who, as saying that his govt's package is better than SCS.

Protests and applause.

“A.P. CM himself accepted this proposal in 2016, and thanked the govt,” he says. But TDP did a U-turn due to politics. “I called up Chandrababu Naidu when TDP decided to quit NDA. I told him you’re falling into the trap of YSRCP. You won't be able to come out.”

Amid slogans, he says the govt won't go back on the welfare of the people of Andra Pradesh.

Lok Sabha | 9.18 p.m.

Prime Minister begins his reply. Praises the power of democracy. It's a chance to reassess the performance of the govt., he says.

“The question is why the motion was moved, when there is no mandate, no numbers,” to bring down the government he asks with a quip about a “bhookambh”, a reference to the popular hashtag on Rahul Gandhi’s speech.

“The only agenda is: ‘Modi hatao,’” he says. “I cannot be removed except by the 125 crore people of India. Why this hurry to remove me. In democracy, we should remain patient,” he says amid applause by the Treasury benches.

“It's not the floor test of the govt. But a floor test for the Congress and a trial on the ‘what if I become Prime Minister dream’,” the PM says.

PM halts his speech amid din. Not yielding, though. Speaker is heard pleading to go back to seats.

This is not proper says, the Chair. Ruckus continues. Hard to hear anythin, except Ms. Mahajan’s voice. This is not fair, you have to listen... to the reply, she says.

PM tries to speak. Not heard.

“Sabka saath, sabka vikas government, when we worked on electrification in 18,000 villages... among this 15,000 villages... our tribals, Dalis and backward people reside,” he says.

Slogans heard: “We want justice.”

PM continues his speech despite the sloganeering and applause for his taking credit for the Jan Dhan scheme.

Eight crore toilets have been build for our poor mothers and sisters, he says adding about the free LPG scheme. Quotes an “international report” to claim 5 crore people came out of poverty and reels out other statistics. “These people don't have confidence in that,” he says.

Prime Minister goes on: insurance scheme, health care, LED bulbs and the resultant savings in power, more companies that make mobile phones.

He then moves on to youth: 13 crore youth have been given loans, 10,000 start-ups are taking India forward. Sloganeering continues.

Charges the Opposition with not trusting the people of the country. Quotes a number on the digital transaction. Slogan has changed.

PM says India is 6th in managing the economy. “We used technology to bring Rs. 90,000 crore which would have gone to some other hands. We have shut down 2.5 lakh shell companies.” Adds that benami transactions have been checked to a large extent.

“No trust is part of Congress culture. They have no trust in Yoga day, CJI, RBI and other institutions... why? They don't trust themselves.”

“People who were sitting on a their own special rules were worried when the transformation made its way towards people’s power,” he says. “These days talk of lord Shiva is being made. I pray to him that you people should bring another no-confidence motion after the next elections too...”

After touching on Doklam, he moves on to Rafale. “I cannot imagine such game can be played with the nation's security. The nation won't forgive you. This is the time for you change.”

“Can anyone use such language against our soldiers,” he asks. “I cannot imagine the hurt such irresponsible speech would have caused. Country won't forgive you for calling surgical strikes a jhumla.”

“We must abstain from making childish statements on sensitive issues,” he says of Mr. Gandhi’s speech on Rafale.

He mocks the Congress statement about the numbers. “I remember the 1999 statement made in front of the Rashtrapathi Bhavan about having 272 MPs’ support. And it turned out to be otherwise.”

“This is the culture of the Congress,” he says. From Charan Singh and Chandra Shekar and Deve Gowda to I.K. Gujral who would forget Congress’ withdrawal of support, he says. “And twice Congress tried to buy votes with notes. Who can forget that?”

“I am the son a poor mother. You are privileged (naamdaar). I don't have the courage to see eye to eye,” Mr. Modi quips referring to Mr. Gandhi’s speech earlier.

“And after the eye-to-eye came the wink, everyone is watching in TV, ” he adds about the Rahul wink. “The entire nation saw what the eyes did today. It is clear in front of everyone.”

On keeping fuel price out of GST: “The decision was taken in UPA regime.”

“I am bhaghidar of the poor, of the youth of the country in their dreams... And I am proud about that,” he says.

Congress’ mantra, he says, is if not us, there should be instability in the country. “These are thriving on emotional blackmail of the Dailits, poor and other backward people.”

“Now, those who mocked at Ambedkar’s politics, are they taking credit for his work,” the PM asks.

“Madame Speaker, the Congress is cut off from the ground reality,” he says continuing his anti-Congress tirade. He's yet to speak on any other party, not even the TDP which brought in the motion. However, moments ago he promised: “I am not going to leave anyone. I will give respect to everyone.”

When the BJP can construct its headquarters in 2.5 years, why can't it construct an IIT in Andhra Pradesh in four years, he asks.

'BJP's answer to all questions: Hindu-Pakistan, Hindu-Musalman, Shamshan-Kabristan'

TMC member Dinesh Trivedi speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

Dinesh Trivedi (Trinamool Congress) says he and his party are with the people of Andhra Pradesh. The party that moved no-confidence motion were once with the NDA. If a former ally is unhappy, imagine the plight of other states, Mr. Trivedi says.

We pleaded the government to postpone the no-confidence motion to Monday since West Bengal observes Martyrs Day on July 21. But the government disagreed, he says.

The Supreme Court has condemned mob killings. People are living in fear, he says.

It's Mr. Trivedi's turn to quote Mahabarata now. In the Kurukshetra War, Pandavas were outnumbered by Kauravas. But Pandavas won because they were supported by truth. We will uphold the democracy today, he says. For you, Ram is only in Ayodhya. For us, Ram is everywhere, Mr. Trivedi says.

Mr. Trivedi says rupee's value has fallen, banks are in distress, unemployment is all-time high. But the government has only one answer: Hindu-Pakistan, Hindu-Musalman, Shamshan-Kabristan.

The position of Chief Statistician is lying vacant for six months. The government is only indulging in polarisation. The government promised change but delivering division. The real Indian, the real Hindu is sad today, he claims.

This govt. is anti-Tamil Nadu: Jayavardhan

AIADMK member J. Jayavardhan speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

J. Jayavardhan (AIADMK) accuses the Central government directly infringing the rights of the States with NEET and Dam Safety Bill.

The central government's decision to UGC has a direct effect on the fiscal health of the State, he says. Dr. Jayavardhan's speech highlights how Centre's decisions have affected Tamil Nadu. There is a growing disparity of Centre-State share, he claims.

Dr. Jayavardhan says it was a wrong move to abolish wealth tax.

Dr. Jayavardhan says despite repeated requests from Tamil Nadu legislators, the Central government hasn't done anything to stop killing of innocent fishermen by Sri Lankan Navy. He also accuses the Union government for not taking up Sri Lanka's genocide of Tamils during the Eelam War.

'We have passed all benefits of SCS to AP, without naming it'

BJP member K. Hari Babu speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

K. Hari Babu, the BJP MP from Andhra Pradesh speaks. He says he is amused to see the TDP joining hands with the Congress. The soul of N.T. Rama Rao wouldn't forgive you, he warns. Throughout his life, NTR fought against Congress' politics, he says.

When the reorganisation Act was passed, BJP leaders stood with the residuary Andhra Pradesh. If Congress was really interested in the welfare of the State, why didn't the add the SCS clause in the Bill itself, he says. '

The TDP gave letter supporting bifurcation, but spoke about unified Andhra in the House, Mr. Hari Babu claims.

The SCS doesn't guarantee industrial corridor. It will only give additional aide from the Centre. But the Union government has given more than what SCS would guarantee to the State, Mr. Hari Babu says.

We have passed all benefits of SCS to AP, without calling it so, claims Mr. Hari Babu. The State would get an additional Rs. 3,600 crore if SCS was granted. We have granted Rs. 17,500 crores as central assistance, says Mr. Hari Babu. You have to choose between SCS name and financial assistance, he adds.

Lok Sabha | 6.15 p.m.

We stand with Andhra Pradesh: Kharge

Mallikarjun Kharge thanks the Speaker for allocating more time to members. I am getting a thank you note rarely in these four years, Ms. Mahajan chuckles.

Mr. Kharge reads government's schemes approved to Andhra Pradesh. He recalls the promise made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on granting Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh for a period of five years. In Rajya Sabha, the then Leader of Opposition and present Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had accepted the assurance and withdrew his demands. The current government is not fullfilling its own promises, Mr. Kharge claims.

Mr. Kharge accuses the government of following 'divide and rule'. ""We are supporting the TDP even if they don't support us,"" Mr. Kharge says.

Mr. Kahrge cries foul on the recent hike of MSP. He says the Swaminathan Commission report has not been properly implemented and the hike is a mere eyewash.

Mr. Kharge concludes his speech taking a dig on BJP's election slogans during the 2014 General Elections. When will the promises be met? he asks.

His speech is abruptly stopped due to paucity of time. He requests the Chair to make concluding remarks.

He ends his speech with a poetry.

Lok Sabha | 6.00 p.m.

'We are defending democracy, while you are working against equality'

Congress member Mallikarjun Kharge speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Congress Legislature Party, speaks. I expected the ministers to list government's achievements during their speech. Unfortunately such things didn't happen, he says.

He cites Rajnath Singh's remarks on democracy in India's history. He asks Mr. Singh if his party respected democracy in the last four years. We are defending democracy, while you are working against equality, Mr. Kharge.

Mr. Singh refers Ramayana and Mahabharata, but he doesn't remember Shambu and Ekalavya, Mr. Kharge says. In four years if you have electrified 18,000 villagers, it was due to the 70 years of work previous governments did on electrical generation and distribution, he says.

The government repeatedly accuses the Opposition of disrupting democracy. You repeatedly bring Ordinances. But what stopped you from bringing an Ordinance to amend the Lokpal Act to felicitate appointing an ombudsman, Mr. Kharge asks.

Paswan targets SP, RJD

Ram Vilas Paswan says the Opposition is trying to portray a wrong message that the government is anti-Dalit. The change in reservation policy was directed by Supreme Court and not the government. We have appealed against the verdict and obtained stay, he says.

On Women's Bill, Mr. Paswan recalls the episode in Lok Sabha when the Bill was first introduced in 2008. The House wanted to unanimously pass the Bill, but after a brief break parties changed their stand and sought reservation within the Bill, he claims. Members object to his remarks. Are RJD and SP ready to support Women's Bill, he asks.

He takes potshots at alliance between BSP and SP wondering if they had any common platform on any issues.

The Prime Minister considers the Parliament a temple. The Prime Minister has no religion. Mr. Modi never assured Ram temple in the disputed site in Ayodhya. He repeatedly states he will abide by court's verdict, Mr. Paswan says.

His piece of advice to Congress: work hard, seek retrospective, think why they have lost in all but three States.

Lok Sabha | 5.25 p.m.

The government is pro-poor, pro-Dalit, says Paswan

Lok Janshakti Party chief and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan speaks against the motion. He claims the problems of Andhra Pradesh are not new and the Congress has to be blamed for the situation.

In a way I welcome this motion. Only during such discussions, people get to know the truth about the government, Mr. Paswan says.

Mr. Paswan highlights pro-poor initiatives of the government such as free housing, free toilets, total sanitation projects.

The government has brought programmes like Start Up India, Stand Up India, Mudra schemes to encourage entrepreneurship, especially for the downtrodden, Dalits and tribals, he says.

""There a two generation of Dalits — one belonging to Ram Vilas Paswan who tolerated atrocities, and another Chirag Paswan's generation who want to live a life of dignity.""

Your alliance partners are deserting you, Tariq Anwar tells BJP

NCP member Tariq Anwar speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

Tariq Anwar (NCP) lists the drawbacks of the government. Currency value, economic instability, Kashmir unrest, no Lokpal, mob violence, rising prices — Mr. Anwar says these are key issues today.

The government came with 'Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas' slogan, but development is not holistic here, Mr. Anwar says. Farmers are dying, intellectuals are scared of speaking their mind, says Mr. Anwar. Mr. Modi promised corrupt free government. But 31 wilful defaulters have fleed the country and the banks are in distress.

""If this is Ram Rajya, I am afraid to imagine how Ravan Rajya would be,"" Mr. Anwar says.

Your alliance partners are deserting you, Mr. Anwar tells BJP pointing out that Shiv Sena has stayed away for the discussion.

The Prime Minister doesn't take the Opposition into confidence, he should at least take advice of senior leader like Mr. Advani. The situation may change, he hopes.

The government has wasted four years in attempting to malign the Nehru-Gandhi family. People wanted a change and they brought you. The people want to know what are your developments, he says.

Prime Minister's silence on lynchings is like tacit support to mob violence, says Mr. Anwar.

Rajnath Singh lists the funds released by the Centre for development of Andhra Pradesh and its capital Amaravati. If needed, we will give more money, he says.

The TDP has been demanding a Special Category Status. There are some difficulties in granting it. Under 14th Finance Commission, the State would get 32 per cent funds. We have granted more than it. We have also released a special package for the State, Mr. Singh says.

Andhra Pradesh should give up the demand for SCS and speed up their projects, Mr. Singh says.

Andhra Pradesh is also part of this country. We understand the issues it is facing due to bifurcation. We are there to support the State, says Mr. Singh ending his speech.

Lok Sabha | 4.50 p.m.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh says that only under the Prime Minister had the minimum support price (MSP) become double. “This can only be done by someone who was born to a poor woman.”

He refers to Congress president Rahul Gandhi as being born with a silver spoon. “Poverty is a matter of hearing for him, not a matter of suffering,” says the Minister.

''It has now been four years since we took over, and our Prime Minister has not taken even four minutes of leave,'' he notes.

We haven't had a single terror attack in four years, claims Rajnath

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh responds to the Opposition's remarks during a debate on the no-confidence motion against the government, in the Lok Sabha on Friday, July 20, 2018. | Photo Credit: Lok Sabha TV

Mr. Rajnath Singh takes potshots at Mr. Gandhi's speech. Mr. Gandhi should have read history before making remarks. He spoke about Karnataka. India's democracy is older than Britain's. Basavanna held assembly in 12th century. Gram sabhas were held in Thanjavur, he claims.

Speaker says Lok Sabha TV has a wonderful programme on history and people can watch to learn more about India's historic democracy.

Rajnath Singh goes on to elaborate India's ancient rule from Chandragupta Maurya. Jawaharlal Nehru has written about India's secular credentials in his Discovery of India.

The northeastern region has developed under Modi's rule. We have a framework agreement of Naga insurgency, it will be duly informed in the House.

We haven't had a single terror attack in four years, claims Rajnath Singh. Members object.

More naxals have been killed than security forces under this rule.

People who carried out anti-Sikh riots are teaching lessons on mob lynching, remarks Mr. Singh. He was referring to the 1984 riots against Sikhs after Indira Gandhi's assasination.

Mr. Singh talks about 'Hindu Taliban' remark without naming Shashi Tharoor. Don't incidents of chopping Kerala professor's hands by Islam fundamentalist or attacks in Kashmir remind you of Taliban? he asks.

We are a secular country, don't break it, warns Mr. Singh pointing at Opposition

Lok Sabha | 4.30 p.m.

Row over Rahul's 'hug diplomacy'

As Lok Sabha reconvenes, Rajnath Singh continues his speech. He calls Rahul Gandhi’s gesture of hugging the Prime Minister “Chipko Andolan.” Speaker agrees that it was against the decorum of the House.

Mallikarjun Kharge objects to Speaker's remarks. Ms. Mahajan says she wasn't hugging, but the manner it happened was not a parliamentary behaviour. He shouldn't have continued his speech. There is a decorum in the House and it has to be maintained, she says.

Mr. Singh jokingly remarks he would also hug Mr. Kharge after his speech.

Lok Sabha | 4:20 p.m.

Members of Andhra Pradesh raise objection to Rajnath Singh’s speech.

They want the Home Minister to stick to the specifics of Special Category Status to the State. He is the Home Minister of India, not just Andhra Pradesh. Allow him to speak, says the Speaker.

Speaker adjourns the House till 4:30 pm.

In the meantime, Rajya Sabha has been adjourned for the day for the lack of quorum.

Lok Sabha | 4:10 p.m.

'India will be among top 3 economies by 2030'

Home Minister Rajnath Singh continues to speak. India is the fastest growing country in the World. The IMF has predicted that the GDP will bounce back. Fours years ago India was in the ninth position, today we are the sixth largest economy. In 2030, we will be among the top 3 economies, Mr. Singh says. India is the most attractive destination for investment, he adds.

Mr. Singh takes credit for opening the world largest mobilephone factory in Noida. Samajwadi and Congress members claim it was brought by their government. ""I agree, but we increased the capacity to make it the largest firm,"" Mr. Singh says.

There have been earlier instances of economic offenders fleeing the country. But we were the one to bring a bill against fugitive economic offenders.

""The late Rajiv Gandhi remarks every one rupee alloted by the Centre, only 15 paise reaches the common man. Today, thanks to direct benefit transfer, the entire money reaches the beneficiary.""

The Opposition always has doubts. Will the alliance ever happen? Who will lead the alliance? They always have doubts, Mr. Singh remarks.

Lok Sabha | 3:55 p.m.

The people are with Mr. Modi, says Rajnath Singh

Home Minister Rajnath Singh rises to speak. He recalls an incident three-decades ago when Rajiv Gandhi pointed at BJP and remarked ""Hum Do, Hamare Do"". Today, we are the majority in the House. Not a single party had the numbers to bring a no-confidence motion on its own.

It was believed that BJP couldn't win a seat in Kerala. Today, in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, one-third councillors belong to BJP. He cities the example of Tripura, two which the Left members protest.

We won with two-third majority in Tripura, Mr. Singh says. The people who brought no-confidence motion haven't learnt the mood of the nation, he says.

""When we were in the Opposition for 10 years, we never thought of bringing a no-confidence motion since we respected the people's mandate. We respect the Opposition and that is why we heeded to their demands and accepted the no-confidence motion,"" Mr. Singh says.

In the last 30 years, no political party has won majority. For the first time a non-Congress party has earned majority in the House. ""Are you bringing a no-confidence motion against a Prime Minister, on whose appeal millions of Indians voluntarily gave up LPG subsidy and subsidies on railways?"" Mr. Singh highlights that the BJP won majority in Uttar Pradesh after demonetisation exercise.

The people who brought no-confidence motion today are not in the same page. There is difference among them, Mr. Singh says. The alliance they talk, will never happen, he says.

Lok Sabha | 3:45 p.m.

'To save 1%, you are polarising the 99%'

CPI(M) member Mohammad Salim speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

CPI(M) Mohammad Salim begins his speech congratulating Home Minister Rajnath Singh, saying he is the only senior leader in his party to be part of the ministry while others have become 'margdarshaks'. He also wonders if the government has a view.

In the manifesto the BJP claims black money was stashed in foreign banks, ""but you have made Indian currency note illegal,"" he says.

Mr. Modi often says we have done what they have done in 70 years, we have done it in 4 years. But then, Mr. Modi also says in 70 years, Congress has only caused destruction to the nation, he adds.

Mr. Salim reminds the government that they have to go back to the farmers during elections.

By merely seeing presentation, the Centre grants Centre of Eminence tag to a Jio Institute. But if an MP wants to construct a school in his constituency, he has to show proof of land, students, teachers to get funding.

You came in the name of 'Swadeshi', but today you have allowed FDI in every sector including defence, Mr. Salim says.

Over 90 per cent of wealth is with one per cent. To save the one per cent you are polarising the ninety nine per cent. You are dividing and pitting people against each other in the name of religion, language and caste. Those who are talk about harmony is national and others are anti-national, Mr. Salim says.

You may win on lies, but will continue to talk truth even if we lose, says Mr. Salim when BJP members object to his remarks.

Mulayam Singh Yadav of Samajwadi Party is the next speaker. He speaks on farmers issues. The nation will be happy only if farmers are happy. It is getting increasingly difficult to continue farming. The input costs have all gone expensive, he says.

Mr. Modi promised he'll give Rs. 15 lakh per person. How much as he delivered? The people will ask you when you meet them, Mr. Yadav warns.

The farmers are not happy, traders are not happy, prices of medicines are high, inflation is higher, Mr. Yadav says.

He repeatedly says unemployment and farmers' issue are serious issues. The Samajwadi Party won three seats in the Lok Sabha bypolls. It is a message to the Union government, he says.

Define SCS: TRS

TRS member Vinod Kumar Boianapalli speaks during a debate on no-confidence motion against the government, in Lok Sabha, on Friday. Courtesy: Lok Sabha TV

Vinod Kumar Boianapalli of the TRS says that the Telangana state is ensuring all it can to make its people happy. “We are not concerned with their request regarding allocation of funds,” he says referring to the TDP’s demand for Special Category Status.

Deputy Speaker M. Thambidurai is in the Chair.

“Telangana had very few demands. The first was water allocation.”

The Prime Minister should make an announcement on allocation of funds for projects on rivers Krishna and Godavari as they are giving to Polavaram, he says.

There is an assurance in the reorganisation Act for a Central University in Telangana. We have the land. To this day nothing has happened. Other assurances like National Thermal Power Project, National Highways have been partially fulfilled.

Mr. Boianapalli reminds the government that the reorganisation Act made several assurances to Telangana too.

He blames Andhra Pradesh for not constructing a High Court. There is ill-motive. Even though the High Court complex is in Telangana, people of our region are adequately represented, he says. Andhra Pradesh members object to it.

What do you mean by SCS? he asks. There should be a definition. What are you seeking from SCS, there must be clarity, he tells turning to TDP MPs. More objections.

He concludes his speech.

'Namo's demo'

Trinamool Congress Saugata Roy terms demonetisation as 'Namo's Demo as jumla'. After losing 25 lakh jobs and severelu damaging the economy, only Rs. 16,000 crores of black money is reportedly got back. At the time of demonetisation, Rabi season was on, it had adverse effect on farmers. Farmers suicide happened due to this reason. Farmers trade with cash and that cash was stashed away, he says.

Mr. Roy now talks about mob violence. He lists the number of incidents that led to mob lynching. First the attacked Muslims in the name of cow protection, then Dalits... rationalists were killed by right wing forces.

Recalling Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's response to Rahul Gandhi's allegation of Rafale deal, Mr. Roy asks why she is silent on hiking of jet prices.

The BJP wants Congress-Mukth Bharat, but it looks like they want Muslim-Mukt Bharat, he says.

Lok Sabha | 2.40 p.m.

""What has he achieved in this globetrotting?""

Saugata Roy (Trinamool Congress) says there is already no-confidence in the Bench. The BJD has walked out, the Shiv Sena is staying away. This shows they have no confidence in the government. Rest is about number crunching.

The Prime Minister is roaming like a salesman. He visits West Bengal and talks about polarisation. He doesn't speak on development and West Bengal's girl child welfare scheme but talks about 'Trinamool syndicate'. He has stooped so low that even his pandal has fallen, Mr. Roy says.

Shall I talk about the 'Modi syndicate.' The Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi and another Modi is plundering the nation, he says.

It has become an habit for the Prime Minister to travel. The PM has spent Rs.1800 crore on foreign travels. ""What has been achieved in this globetrotting?""

The Prime Minister calls his rallies Kisan Sankalp Rally but farmer suicides continue unabetted. When farmers protest, like in Mandsaur, the police kill them, Mr. Roy says. He claims the MSP hike an eyewash as it doesn't follow Swaminathan panel suggestions.

Step-motherly treatment to Tamil Nadu, claims MP

P. Venugopal of AIADMK rises to speak. He says the relationship between Centre and States are like that of mother and her children. But the mother is meting out step-motherly treatment to some States, he says.

Quoting that India is the sixth largest economy, Mr. Venugopal says Tamil Nadu is one of the key States to achieve this. There is an unpaid claims of Rs. 6066.5 crores pending with the Centre. The Chief Minister has written twice, but funds haven't been released, he says. The State is yet to recieve arrears to the tune of Rs. 1100 crores, Mr. Venugopal says.

Women safety and mob lynching are important issues. The main reason in unemployment, poverty and drug menace. The Centre cannot say it's a State issue. States don't produce drugs. It's being smuggled from other countries. The Centre should ensure border is not porus, he says.

Mr. Venugopal thanks the Prime Minister for constituting the Cauvery Board. Let the people decide in 2019, says Mr. Venugopal hinting that his party may stay away from voting.

Quoting a media report, Ms. Sitharaman says the French President has said if the confidentiality clause is violated, we would take it seriously.

Congress members raise objection to Ms. Sitharaman taking the name of former defence minister.

Harsimrat Kaur says this is Parliament. There is no place for Munna Bhai's jaadhu ji jhappi.

Kalyan Banerjee (TMC) raises Point of Order. The minister should present the papers supporting his/her claims, he says. Ms. Sitharaman says she has already showed the proof.

The Prime Minister and Mr Amit Shah are different type of politicians. They are not like us (Congress). We are okay with winning and losing, staying in and out of power. But they cannot afford to lose power. They fear losing power. It is this fear that is turning as anger, Mr. Gandhi says.

I thank the Prime Minister for showing me the importance of Congress, the true meaning of Lod Shiva, says Rahul Gandhi. I know I am a pappu for you, but I don't have any anger against you, says Mr. Gandhi.

Mr. Gandhi walks up to Mr. Modi and hugs him.

Speaker asks Rahul to temper his words

Congress president Rahul Gandhi says Prime Minister Narendra Modi said farm loans would be waived, but the Finance Minister later said it cannot happen. “Petrol prices are falling everywhere in the world, but only in India, they are rising. Mr. Modi is pocketing money for his rich friends.''

Speaker interrupts him saying that he can lay facts and figures on the table, and that he uses words appropriate for the House.

Treasury Bench demands an apology from Rahul Gandhi. There is ruckus in the House and Mr. Gandhi’s speech stops.

House is adjourned till 1.55 p.m.

Modi and Nirmala Sitharaman have lied to the country, Rahul Gandhi says

Rahul Gandhi says the government has taken money from small businessmen and the poor.

“The Prime Minister’s face comes on the Jio ad. It means he only cares about the rich.” He says that Mr. Modi called himself the chowkidaar of the country.

The Treasury Benches raise their voices in protest once Rahul Gandhi mentions the Rafale deal. Mr. Gandhi says Mr. Modi and Nirmala Sitharaman, the Defence Minister, have lied to the nation. He says he met the French President and that the latter said there was no deal between India and France.

He says that Mr. Modi has a close relationship with certain businessmen, and that one of the businessmen was given the Rafale contract, after it was taken away from HAL. “We can all see the money being spent on marketing Mr. Modi.” He says the Prime Minister must answer in this House if the Cabinet Committee for Security took this decision. “Why was the contract taken away from HAL and the youngsters of Karnataka and given to this businessman who has a debt of ₹30,000 crore?”

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar says that Mr. Gandhi’s allegations are in a defamatory manner. He reads our rule 353.

“No allegation of a defamatory or incriminatory nature shall be made by a member against any person unless the member has given adequate advance notice to the Speaker and also to the Minister concerned so that the Minister may be able to make an investigation into the matter for the purpose of a reply.”

He says that Xi Jinping came to Gujarat, and the Prime Minister sat on a swing with Mr. Xi — jhoola, jhoola. “The Chinese premier went back and then attacked us at Doklam.” A few days later, Mr. Gandhi says, Mr. Modi visited China without an agenda. He alleges that Mr. Modi did not visit without an agenda, but instead that it was China’s agenda on the cards.

He says that Mr. Modi is not the chowkidaar, but the bhaagidaar.

‘Jumla strikes’

Congress president Rahul Gandhi rises to speak next.

“I heard Mr. Galla’s speech very carefully. In your speech, I sensed a certain anxiety and a deep feeling of pain. I want to tell you that you are the victim of a 21st century political weapon. The political weapon is called the jumla strike.”

He describes it as a great sense of excitement, happiness, followed by a feeling of shock and eight-hour long speeches. The victims are the farmers, the youngsters, dalits, tribals and the women of the country, he says.

He lists the government’s election promises as examples of jumla — ₹15 lakh in each citizen’s bank account, jobs for two crore youths. He says the truth is that only four lakh youths have jobs now.

China has given 50,000 youths jobs in 24 hours, while this government has given only 400 youths jobs in 24 hours. He refers to the Prime Minister’s pakora statement.

“At 8 p.m., you took action on black money by bringing in demonetisation. You didn’t understand that the poor have only cash. And today, India has the highest unemployment. This is what the Prime Minister’s word means.”

He then goes on to say that GST was brought by the Congress. “You opposed it as Gujarat Chief Minister,” he says. The PM’s GST has five different GSTs, and you sent the Income Tax department to small businesses.

He says that Prime Minister speaks only to “suit-boot” corporates and not small businessmen.

People will never accept such a motion: Rakesh Singh

Rakesh Singh of the BJP starts listing out all the schemes that were started 20-30 years back during the Congress’ time, which were now completed by the NDA government.

He then goes on to speak about the progress brought about in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh by the BJP government.

Members object to his speech. Mr. Singh tells a Member that if he does such things, he won’t be reelected.

Opposition continues to disrupt Mr. Singh’s speech. He says that country wants to know why there is a no-confidence motion, when the government is functioning so well.

He says that the Opposition is against Mr. Modi’s popularity and that the people will never accept such a motion.

In the last four years, India’s name has been burnished, he says. With this he concludes his speech, saying there is no need for a no-confidence motion.

Lok Sabha | 12.30 p.m.

‘In 70 years, even on Diwali, there was no electricity’

The whole world is saying that all government schemes are not to divide people, but fulfil the needs of the people, says Rakesh Singh of the BJP.

He says the Congress has given the country a tainted government.

He says that if earlier governments had cared about the women of the country, then poor women would not have had to live with chulhas for cooking. He credits Mr. Modi with giving LPG to poor women.

He says that the government is proud to announce that in the first time in the history of independent India, every village is electrified. “In 70 years, even on Diwali, there was no electricity. With Saubhagya Yojana, every village now has electricity. This is not for those houses, but for coming generations.”

He also credits the Prime Minister’s Jan Aushadhi Scheme for providing free medicines to people. Mr. Singh says under the Modi government, cleanliness has finally become important, something the Congress had ignored all these years.

The Jabalpur MP says that bureaucracy under the Congress was slow to respond and sluggish in action. He says that, in the last four years, there has been a marked change in the way the bureaucracy functions.

He cites the government’s “surgical strikes” as an example of strong action against hostile neighbours.

“We have even built a temple in a Muslim nation,” says Mr. Singh. The MP first refers to the country as Saudi Arabia, but after shouting from the Opposition, corrects himself saying he meant the UAE.

‘Congress ran a scam regime’

Rakesh Singh of BJP is the next member to speak. Before he can begin speaking the Treasury Benches rise in protest against an unparliamentary word used by the TDP Member. Shouting commences in the House. Speaker says she will expunge the remark if the record proves it.

Mr. Singh says that democracy has to be strong for the country to develop and be stable. He says democracy does not mean only their government. “Any government, formed by any party should have the freedom to function.”

He says the government’s work in the development of the country is not over. He says that on listening to Mr. Galla’s speech, there seems to be no strong reason to bring a no-confidence motion.

He says that Mr. Galla cursed the government, but he is cursed for siding with the Congress. He cites Karnataka Chief Minister J.D. Kumaraswamy crying after entering into an alliance with the Congress. Shouts of condemnation are heard from the Opposition Benches.

He says the government has the mandate of the people. Mr. Singh says the Opposition wants to stop from Narendra Modi winning. In 70 years after Independence, he says that one family from the Congress has ruled the country for 48 years. He credits the 10 years under Dr. Manmohan Singh to Sonia Gandhi.

He calls the Congress a “scam regime.”

Mr. Singh, a Member representing the Jabalpur constituency, says that for the first time in 70 years, people are seeing a change in their lives. “We can now see happiness in the faces of the poor.” He goes on to list the different schemes the government has started in the last four years.

Shouting can be heard from Congress Members. Speaker asks them to sit down, and says nothing they say will go on the record.

‘We only ask justice’

Jayadev Galla speaks on behalf of the TDP during the debate on the no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha on Friday, July 20, 2018. The TDp has moved the motion. | Photo Credit: Lok Sabha TV

Jayadev Galla of the TDP says ₹3000 crore each have been alloted to build statue of Sardar Patel in Gujarat and Chatrapati Shivaji in Maharashtra, but this government is allotting just over Rs. 1000 crore for creating the Capital of Amaravati. ""Statues are getting more funds than capital,"" he says.

Mr. Galla claims more funds are being alloted for GIFT City in Gujarat and Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra. Mr. Modi wanted to create a capital city like Astana in Kazhakstan. Any idea how much was spent in creating the city, he asks.

We have spent 98 per cent funds received, he says.

AP has been given less funds than the amount spent on making Bahubali cinema, Mr. Galla says.

TDP made four four long years, and five budgets. We requested, protested, walk out of government. Nothing has happened, he says. I am not against bifurcation. I am against the way it was bifurcated... in a most undemocratic manner, he says.

Telangana members object to his remarks.

Mr. Galla's speech is halted as his time limit has ended. TDP members protest. Speaker allows him to give concluding remarks.

""From AP we have become residual AP. We are not asking to turn the clock back. We only ask justice,"" He ends the speech quoting Sardar Patel.

Lok Sabha | 11:50 am

'AP got only 2-3 per cent of its requirements'

Rs. 2.3 lakh cores are being collected through cess and it is not being shared to the States, Jayadev Galla of the TDP says.

After the 14th Finance Commission, the AP will be the only revenue deficit State. The Union Government is treating AP on par with the northeastern states, while we are a southern State.

The BJP claims they have given Rs. 13,472 crores. Out of 16,000 crore deficit, they have given only about Rs. 3000 crores. For the new capital we have been given only Rs. 1000 crores. We want over a lakh crore. You have given only 2-3 per cent of our requirement, he says.

Lok Sabha | 11:45 am

'We were deceived by the FM'

On allegations that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has changed his goal posts after being part of the Union Government for four years, Jayadev Galla of the TDP says they ""were deceived by the assurances made by the Finance Minister.""

Mr. Galla says the ""special package"" assured to backward districts of the Andhra Pradesh was actually for 150 such districts across the country. Mr. Galla says the per head allocation is just Rs. 428. He also claims Bundelkhand and Madhya Pradesh got a better deal.

Mr. Galla says the State government has utilised the funds released by the States and he has data to support it. While we are waiting for Rs. 12,000 crores to be released, the Finance Minister says only Rs. 100 crores would be released, he says.

Members claim Mr. Galla is speaking beyond the prescribed time. ""He is the mover, let him speak,"" Speaker says.

Lok Sabha | 11:34 am

Galla targets PM in his speech

Jayadev Galla of the TDP accuses the Congress party of slicing the Telugu Talli in two pieces in the most unscientific way.

Narendra Modi, the then Gujarat Chief Minister, had said Congress has killed the mother and saved the child. ""Had I been there, I would have saved the mother too,"" Mr. Galla quotes Mr. Modi. The people of AP fell flat for Mr. Modi's words. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any respects for the word.

""Mr. Prime Minister, you had asked if the people wanted a Seemandhra, or Scam Andhra?, but you are protecting the family of Galli Janardhan Reddy,"" he says.

(The Reddy brothers were named as accused in Karnataka mining scam)

Quoting Article 4 of Constitution, Mr. Galla says the assurances made in the Parliament has to be fullfilled. He also says the 14th Finance Commission also betrays the State.

Mr. Galla seeks more time to speak. Speaker allots five more minutes.

The BJP's manifesto mentions about Special Category Status. The NITI Aayog wanted to continue with SCS. Bihar and Puducherry supported granting SCS to Andhra Pradesh. ""I appeal with folded hands to grant the SCS to Andhra Pradesh,"" he says.

'AP is the loser in reorganisation'

Rs. 1.3 lakh crore loan burden is being put on the Andhra Pradesh. The state is a loser as during reorganisation funds were divided based on population, and resources were based on location, Jayadev Galla of the TDP says.

Power was based on consumption, again AP is the loser, he says.

Ruckus in parliament as Telangana members protest.

Both the governments betrayed the State, says Mr. Galla, who claims the government's reason for not granting a Special Category Status as the State is better-off than other Indian States.

The State is one of the five southern States, and AP not better than it's neighbours, Mr. Galla says presenting the comparison data.

Lok Sabha | 11:15 am

Telangana is not the new State, but AP: Galla

TDP member Srinivas Kesineni moves motion ""That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Council of Ministers""

TDP member Jayadev Galla is the first member to speak. He begins the speech by thanking parties such as RJD, Trinamool, CPI(M), AAP and others who have supported the move.

Mr. Galla, the first-time MP begins his speech quoting a Telugu movie ""Bharath Ane Nenu"", a Mahesh Babu starrer blockbuster of a NRI son taking up the reigns of the State following his father's death. The theme of the movie, Mr. Galla says, was ""a promise is a promise.""

Issues of Andhra Pradesh is a national issue and an emotional issue for the people of the State, he says.

The motion is brought on four points: fairness, trust, priority, and bias. Actually, it's the lack of four points, Mr. Galla says.

Mr. Galla claims it's not Telangana, but Andhra Pradesh, which is the new state, since it have to create a new capital. He says the AP Reorganisation Act was passed undemocratically, by bulldozing the Parliament. Members of Congress and BJP object to his remarks. Mr. Galla continues to speak.

Will use no-confidence motion to expose govt’s ‘ failures’: Congress

Congress leader Anand Sharma. File | Photo Credit: PTI

The Congress on Thursday said that the ‘no-confidence motion’ was more than a show of numbers and it will use the occasion to “expose” the government’s “failure.""

Addressing a press conference, Congress’ senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said his party has the support of other opposition parties on the no-confidence motion which has been brought “to show the mirror to the government”, highlight the various issues concerning the people of the country and ensure that the truth reaches them.

“It is not only a question of numbers. We will use the occasion to expose the government and raise various issues concerning the people of the country and tell the truth to the people.

“Our campaign is to expose them, tell the people the truth so that they are deposed for good when the general elections are there. So, this is the launch of a campaign which will eventually send them packing in 2019,” he told reporters.

Mr. Sharma claimed that the opposition parties are together, except for those who were their allies.

10: 00 a.m

Either support or remain neutral: TDP's strategy

The Telugu Desam Party has decided to field Guntur MP Jayadev Galla, who was hailed in social media for his power-packed speech in Parliament during the Budget session in February, to initiate the debate though Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) had moved the motion.

Party supremo and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday wrote letters to the MPs of all political parties seeking support to the motion. His bottomline message to his own party MPs was “No party should oppose us. See that either they support us or remain neutral.”

9: 30 a.m

The numbers game

The BJP has the numbers to coast through the no-confidence motion. The party currently has 273 members. The total strength of Lok Sabha is now 534, excluding the Speaker, since 10 seats are lying vacant.

The BJP-led NDA has 312 members, while the majority mark is 268. The BJP is hopeful that regional parties like AIADMK, BJD, TRS — which has 37, 19 and 11 members- will either support it or abstain from voting.

Though the numbers are heavily stacked against the Opposition, the Congress and other parties have indicated that they are keen to utilise the debate to attack the government on a range of of issues including farm distress, slow economic growth and rising incidents of lynching.

9: 00 a.m.

BJP will look to send political message to Opposition

The no-trust move in Parliament is a good time for the BJP to delineate its political message for the 2019 General Elections, a set piece that will pit Prime Minister Modi against an Opposition that is uniting to take him on.

While notices were moved by Opposition MPs in the last budget session, the Speaker did not grant leave for them to be taken up, as the support of 50 members could not be ascertained due to protests in the well of the House.

The government is confident not just of facing the motion but also getting more votes than the strength of the NDA.

The former governor of Puerto Rico, the Hon. Ricardo Rosselló, in 2019 signed Executive Order EO-2019-16 that “partially” banned conversion therapy for minors on the island after the House of Representatives decided not to vote on Senate Bill 1000, which would have made these therapies illegal. The executive order requires all medical institutions applying for a license from the Health Department to guarantee that they will not offer conversion therapy. However, this is not enough to address the problem since the order is limited to the executive’s powers. Also, any future governor can repeal it, so it cannot be relied on to guarantee the protection that minors deserve. Although the EO does represent a positive advance to prohibit conversion therapies, it is vitally important to enact it into law to address them and expressly prohibit them. This legislation should be extended to the religious sector and mental health professionals to protect minors.

Different senators recently introduced Senate Bill 184 to expand protections for minors’ physical and mental health and prohibit the practice of conversion therapy against LGBTIQ+ people. The bill defines conversion therapy as a “practice or treatment provided by an entity or professional who is licensed or certified to provide mental health services that seeks to change the sexual orientation or gender identity in an individual.” The definition includes any effort or treatment to change a person’s bodily behavior, expressions, or sexual orientation and eliminate or reduce romantic or sexual attractions or feelings towards individuals of the same gender. The bill identifies conversion therapy as a form of child abuse, including “institutional abuse,” as established in the Child Safety, Well-being and Protection Act of Puerto Rico. However, legislators keep debating the bill’s approval under the assumption these therapies do not happen on the island anymore.

Over the decades, conversion therapies used to “cure” homosexuality included hypnosis, lobotomies, inducing nausea, vomiting, paralysis, electric shock, chemical castration, among other things. In Puerto Rico, conversion therapies exist, and they are far from being what they once were in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. Conversion therapies that are practiced today in Puerto Rico, the United States and around the world occur with the consent and the enforcement of the religious sector and health professionals with faith-based beliefs. We focus on our minors’ physical abuse, forgetting the emotional and psychological abuse that continues to occur in each corner of Puerto Rico, in doctor’s offices and churches. To forget this fact on purpose and use it to defend the non-existence of reparative therapies in Puerto Rico by our majority legislators (members of the Popular Democratic Party) is irresponsible and ignorant. It threatens the best welfare of our minors and their responsibility as state entities to ensure it.

In 2018, Senate Bill 1000 favored eliminating conversion therapies on the island. It would have allowed the survivors of these therapies to relate their experiences and traumatic processes to psychological clinics and churches. Several victims of these therapies told their stories during public hearings. Some of their stories are the following:

Survivor Caleb Esteban said that he received therapy at a counseling center when he was between 14- and 15-years-old. He later learned that the counselor had no education to give mental health treatment, but she was there because she was a church leader. He said that the therapy consisted of performing exorcism-type prayers to get rid of the “demons.”

Another survivor, Sofia Padrón, said she “was taken at 16 by my mother to a psychologist because I was attracted to women. The psychologist said that he treated me as a pastor, not as a psychologist, that same-sex attraction was a temporary phase and that I was confused. He told me that I couldn’t be happy and that my attraction to women was not normal …”

Alvín A. Rivera was 14 – and 15-years-old in 2014 and 2015 when he was taken by his mother to the church because he felt attracted to men. There, the pastor, who was also a psychologist, performed exorcisms to combat his homosexuality and charged his mother for these services. After several occasions, the pastor told Alvin and his mother that he “was cured” that he “had managed to free him from his demon.”

Alejandro Santiago between 2008-2013 attended his church. There, the pastor recommended fasting and long hours of praying to cure him of homosexuality and “not behaving as a man should behave.” The fasts began at 5 a.m. and ended at midnight. Sometimes they summoned the congregation of the church for a prayer circle to cure Alejandro of his homosexuality. Sometimes Alejandro stood in front of hundreds of people to claim the homosexuality demon had been released from his body. Alejandro suffered from depression and anxiety for many years after this. Today, he is a human rights activist.

The stories mentioned above are just a few of the many others happening in Puerto Rico every day. However, legislators persist in the narrative that conversion therapies do not exist in Puerto Rico. The new position of the legislators confirms again that the stigma and prejudices towards homosexuality continue. Unfortunately, this only creates more bigotry and more significant harm to the most vulnerable.

About 28 percent of LGBTQ youth who have undergone the above conversion therapies have attempted suicide, compared to 12 percent of LGBTQ youth who had not undergone conversion therapy, according to the Williams Institute. Suicide rates among LGBTQ youth who have undergone conversion therapies, such as the ones mentioned above, are extremely high, and these practices in Puerto Rico are a clear example of how the state fails to fulfill its duty to ensure the best welfare of our minors.

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has upheld the state’s duty to protect minors on countless occasions. The constitutional right to religious freedom or parents’ power over their children is not absolute, and it yields to the state’s responsibility to ensure that our minors do not suffer from emotional abuse, such as those currently caused by reparative therapies on the island. It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that these minors are protected, or we will continue to be responsible for the increase in numbers of depression and suicide in Puerto Rico. On three different occasions, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decisions that allowed New Jersey’s anti-conversion therapy law to remain in effect. The U.S. Supreme Court also refused to hear challenges to California’s anti-conversion therapy law in May 2017 and in June 2014 it left in place decisions from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that affirmed the law’s constitutionality.

There is extensive scientific evidence on the harm that conversion therapies do to minors, including those that not physically invasive. Conversion therapies constitute mistreatment of our children, and this must be established through legislation in Puerto Rico. Health professionals and members of the religious sector charge for these exorcism services, therapies, and spiritual sessions. Parents and minors themselves believe that they will have “a normal” life upon completion of these therapies. These practices promote depression, anxiety, and invalidation in our youth. They are not practices of love or an affirmation of the love of God, and they result in increased suicide rates and low self-esteem in our society. Our minors’ lives and their emotional state are again in Puerto Rico’s legislators’ hands. Hopefully, this time they will listen and vote to prohibit these tortures on the island.","(Image by Nicolas Raymond; courtesy of Flickr)The former governor of Puerto Rico, the Hon.

123,https://jordantimes.com/opinion/ali-kassay/no-honour-murder,"Sun, 01 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Jordan Times,No honour in murder,"Last week, the Jordanian Court of Cassation upheld the Criminal Court’s verdict convicting two brothers of the premeditated murder of their sister and her sister-in-law. The court rejected their defence that they acted to uphold their family’s honour and handed them the maximum penalty. This was one of several cases recently that received similar sentences, which may indicate that the Jordanian justice system no longer grants impunity to murderers who falsely try to dignify gender crimes with the underserved varnish of honour.

First and foremost, hats off to Rana Husseini for spearheading the campaign against murder in the name of honour. She had the courage to stand alone for a long time, while many in Jordan criticised her for “showing the country in a bad light”.

Second, Jordan had taken a progressive step in suspending the death sentence, then revived the practice under extraordinary and very painful circumstances. It may be time to consider suspending it again since there is no evidence that its use, throughout history, has had an effect in limiting crime.

But the essential question is: when will society stop clouding the culpability of murderers by associating the basest crimes with the highest human aspiration — honour?

Exploitation and violence against women are problems as old as time. In Arab societies, they go back to the Jahiliya, when Arabs were nomadic desert-dwellers who lived with hunger as their constant companion. A nubile girl was a potential asset because she could become the wife of a person of consequence in the tribe; and if she bore him a son quickly enough, then his wealth and influence would boost the status of her father and brothers.

Conversely, if the person of consequence satisfied his libido with the girl without marrying her, then he would move on to sow his wild oats farther afield, while she would turn into a burden to her father and brothers, who would need to provide for her and any resulting offspring. They often preferred to kill her in order to preserve not the family’s honour but its meager resources.

This was a time when people habitually killed their children out of poverty, a practice censured in the Qur’an: “And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is a great sin.” (Al Israa – 31).

Humanity has moved on since those dark days, but some of its worst practices, such as gender violence and femicide, have survived as cherished values. In Jordan, according to Human Rights Watch, between 15 and 20 women and girls are burned, beaten or stabbed to death by family members because they allegedly transgressed against the social codes of “honour”, despite a fatwa declaring that these odious killings are contrary to Sharia.

If any society’s code of honour requires sacrificing women, like pagans offering sacrificial virgins to their idols, that society needs to seriously re-examine its values. Last week’s court verdict was an important step in this direction.

124,https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/students-in-sierra-leone-will-no-longer-pay-for-university-application-forms/,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sierra Leone Telegraph,Students in Sierra Leone will no longer pay for university application forms,"Sierra Leone Telegraph: 13 July 2018:

Gaining university entrance in Sierra Leone is a very costly business for thousands of students and parents across the country, the majority of whom – over 80%, are either unemployed or living well below the poverty line.

When the cost of tuition fees is added to the perverse policy of charging for application forms, then one gets the sense of a government policy that is wired to exclude the poor from gaining higher education.

Yet after ten years in power, presiding over what many regard as a failed education policy, former president Koroma (Photo) says that he is proud of his socialist values and approach to governance.

But there is nothing socialist about asking poor parents of students that are struggling to gain higher education admission to fork out Le 5.6 Billion every year for university application forms.

It is extortionate and promotes education for the few and not the many.

Yesterday, newly elected president Julius Maada Bio decided to eliminate the payment of fees for university application forms, starting from this academic year – September 2018/2019.

This news comes as part of the new government’s proposed policy of free education for all, which is yet to be unfolded.

It is estimated that the government’s free education programme could cost over $200 million to implement in the first five years.

But the government is struggling to raise revenue to meet its core expenditure.

It says that the former Koroma led government bankrupted the country before leaving office three months ago.

There are demands for former ministers and officials of the Koroma government to face justice for corruption and abuse of office.

Sierra Leone’s economy is struggling. Unemployment is high. Taxation revenue is low. International donor funds have declined.

The IMF is yet to release funds – over $200 million it had frozen under the former Koroma leadership.

With literacy level at 40% and an average daily income of less than $2 per capita, the Bio led government will now be thinking very hard about prioritising its spending to ensure that the right balance is struck between primary, secondary and higher education funding.

So what has president Bio announced? This is what his statements says:

“His Excellency the President has directed that Government pays for the application forms estimated at Le 5.6 billion (FIVE BILLION SIX HUNDRED MILLION LEONES).

“The total number of targeted beneficiaries is 15,000 students, applying to the University of Sierra Leone (including Fourah Bay College, College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences and Institute for Public Administration and Management), Njala University, Milton Margai College of Education and Technology, Eastern Polytechnic, Freetown Teachers College, University of Makeni, Ernest Bai Koroma University and Bonthe Technical College.

“The refunds will be provided through the Institutions listed above, after a full verification of total number of applicants and amount paid by each applicant. On receipt of funds from Government, the Institutions will refund the same amount to all those who bought application forms for September 2018/2019 academic year.

“His Excellency the President believes that at a time when he inherited an economy that is near collapse, the cost of application forms for university admission is a burden for many parents, guardians and relatives supporting young people to access higher education. Eliminating an estimated Le 5.6 billion for the payment of university application fees will not only be huge savings for parents, guardians and relatives but also it will increase access to higher education for young people.” (End).

This policy decision will be welcomed by parents across the country.

But there are still questions to be answered about when and how the government’s free universal education programme will be rolled out; how much it will actually cost and how it will be paid for.

President Bio’s finance minister – J.J. saffa will today present the SLPP government’s first Budget to the country’s parliament.

It will outline the government’s expenditure plans for 2018/2019.

Massive cuts in the former APC government’s reckless spending are expected to be announced today, if the SLPP government is to balance the books and pay for vital public services, such as health and education.

Will it make provision for the cost of free education, which the Sierra Leone Telegraph estimates may cost the government over $200 million in the first five years?

“We are going to have a thorough review of the curriculum of the Department of Education. After all, we have been there for two years already so we have made enough experience,” DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones said in a Palace briefing.

“We will review the curriculum from Kindergarten to Grade 12 because we have been getting feedback as well and we are welcoming feedback from the public about curriculum content,” she added.

Briones said DepEd did not elaborate what “feedback” the agency has been receiving, but stressed the need to keep up with changing times, especially in the age of technological innovations.

“Two years have passed. We need to review it because right now, changes are occurring. Many things are happening in this world,” Briones said.

The education chief said she had observed, for instance, how the demand to teach students on “speaking beautiful English” to be able to compete in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry was problematic.

“There was a demand before that we should teach our children more English so they could compete in the BPO, the call center. But call centers are now replaced with robots in other countries. So if we are preparing our children to speak beautiful English for call centers, then perhaps we will truly be left behind,” Briones said.

“We have to teach our children to be the ones to make the robots. This is why we are teaching robotics in high schools. This is why we are sending teams, public school, high school kids to other countries and they are winning in robotics contests,” she added.

Briones said what’s more important than memorization is for students to be taught how to analyze and solve problems.

“What we want our children to learn, which probably my generation did not learn, is not memory work, we teach them how to analyze, how to solve problems, how to respond to change and to accept change because by the time they graduate, whatever we have taught them, not all of them will be applicable. They will not be able to recognize the world they are going to enter,” Briones said.

“Change is happening so fast but it is in dealing with the change that we want our children to gain more life skills,” she added.

The K to 12 Program covers 13 years of basic education from Kindergarten to Grade 3, Grades 4 to 6, Grades 7 to 10 (Junior High School), and Grades 11 and 12 (Senior High School).

Meanwhile, Briones said her agency is also set to rationalize its budget.

“My priority is our financial management system. We have to review and we have to reformulate our accounting, our disbursement, our accountability systems because of the hugeness of the department itself,” Briones said.

Under the proposed PHP 3.757 trillion national budget for 2019, the DepEd gets the highest cut at PHP 659.3 billion which will also include funding for free tuition in state universities and colleges (SUCs).

By Ray McGovern

Special to Consortium News

Former FBI attorney Lisa Page has reportedly told a joint committee of the House of Representatives that when FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok texted her on May 19, 2017 saying there was “no big there there,” he meant there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

It was clearly a bad-luck day for Strzok, when on Friday the 13th this month Page gave her explanation of the text to the House Judiciary and Oversight/Government Reform Committees and in effect threw her lover, Strzok, under the bus.



Strzok’s apparent admission to Page about there being “no big there there” was reported on Friday by John Solomon in the Opinion section of The Hill based on multiple sources who he said were present during Page’s closed door interview.

Strzok’s text did not come out of the blue. For the previous ten months he and his FBI subordinates had been trying every-which-way to ferret out some “there” — preferably a big “there” — but had failed miserably. If Solomon’s sources are accurate, it is appearing more and more likely that there was nothing left for them to do but to make it up out of whole cloth, with the baton then passed to special counsel Robert Mueller.

The “no there there” text came just two days after former FBI Director James Comey succeeded in getting his friend Mueller appointed to investigate the alleged collusion that Strzok was all but certain wasn’t there.

Robert Parry, the late founder and editor of Consortium News whom Solomon described to me last year as his model for journalistic courage and professionalism, was already able to discern as early as March 2017 the outlines of what is now Deep State-gate, and, typically, was the first to dare report on its implications.

Parry’s article, written two and a half months before Strzok texted the self-incriminating comment to Page on there being “no big there there,” is a case study in professional journalism. His very first sentence entirely anticipated Strzok’s text: “The hysteria over ‘Russia-gate’ continues to grow … but at its core there may be no there there.”(Emphasis added.)

As for “witch-hunts,” Bob and others at Consortiumnews.com, who didn’t succumb to the virulent HWHW (Hillary Would Have Won) virus, and refused to slurp the Kool-Aid offered at the deep Deep State trough, have come close to being burned at the stake — virtually. Typically, Bob stuck to his guns: he ran an organ (now vestigial in most Establishment publications) that sifted through and digested actual evidence and expelled drivel out the other end.

Those of us following the example set by Bob Parry are still taking a lot of incoming fire — including from folks on formerly serious — even progressive — websites. Nor do we expect a cease-fire now, even with Page’s statement (about which, ten days after her interview, the Establishment media keep a timorous silence). Far too much is at stake.

As Mark Twain put it, “It is easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.” And, as we have seen over the past couple of years, that goes in spades for “Russia-gate.” For many of us who have looked into it objectively and written about it dispassionately, we are aware, that on this issue, we are looked upon as being in sync with President Donald Trump.

Blind hatred for the man seems to thwart any acknowledgment that he could ever be right about something—anything. This brings considerable awkwardness. Chalk it up to the price of pursuing the truth, no matter what bedfellows you end up with.

Courage at The Hill

Solomon’s article merits a careful read, in toto. Here are the most germane paragraphs:

“It turns out that what Strzok and Lisa Page were really doing that day [May 19, 2017] was debating whether they should stay with the FBI and try to rise through the ranks to the level of an assistant director (AD) or join Mueller’s special counsel team. [Page has since left the FBI.]

“‘Who gives a f*ck, one more AD [Assistant Director] like [redacted] or whoever?’” Strzok wrote, weighing the merits of promotion, before apparently suggesting what would be a more attractive role: ‘An investigation leading to impeachment?’ …

“A few minutes later Strzok texted his own handicap of the Russia evidence: ‘You and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I’d be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there’s no big there there.’

“So the FBI agents who helped drive the Russia collusion narrative — as well as Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Mueller — apparently knew all along that the evidence was going to lead to ‘nothing’ and, yet, they proceeded because they thought there was still a possibility of impeachment.”

Solomon adds: “How concerned you are by this conduct is almost certainly affected by your love or hatred for Trump. But put yourself for a second in the hot seat of an investigation by the same FBI cast of characters: You are under investigation for a crime the agents don’t think occurred, but the investigation still advances because the desired outcome is to get you fired from your job. Is that an FBI you can live with?”

The Timing

As noted, Strzok’s text was written two days after Mueller was appointed on May 17, 2017. The day before, on May 16, The New York Times published a story that Comey leaked to it through an intermediary that was expressly designed (as Comey admitted in Congressional testimony three weeks later) to lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Hmmmmm.

Had Strzok forgotten to tell his boss that after ten months of his best investigative efforts — legal and other—he could find no “there there”?

Comey’s leak, by the way, was about alleged pressure from Trump on Comey to go easy on Gen. Michael Flynn for lying at an impromptu interrogation led by — you guessed it — the ubiquitous, indispensable Peter Strzok.

In any event, the operation worked like a charm — at least at first. And — absent revelation of the Strzok-Page texts — it might well have continued to succeed. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein named Mueller, one of Comey’s best buddies, to be special counsel, Mueller, in turn, picked Strzok to lead the Russia-gate team, until the summer, when the Department of Justice Inspector General was given the Strzok-Page texts and refused to sit on them.

A Timeline

Here’s a timeline, which might be helpful:

2017

May 16: Comey leak to NY Times to get a special counsel appointed

May 17: Special counsel appointed — namely, Robert Mueller.

May 19: Strzok confides to girlfriend Page, “No big there there.”

July: Mueller appoints Strzok lead FBI Agent on collusion investigation.

August: Mueller removes Strzok after learning of his anti-Trump texts to Page.

Dec. 12: DOJ IG releases some, but by no means all, relevant Strzok-Page texts to Congress and the media, which first reports on Strzok’s removal in August.

2018

June 14: DOJ IG Report Published.

June 15; Strzok escorted out of FBI Headquarters.

June 21: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces Strzok has lost his security clearances.

July 12: Strzok testifies to House committees. Solomon reports he refused to answer question about the “there there” text.

July 13: Lisa Page interviewed by same committees. Answers the question.

Earlier: Bob Parry in Action

On December 12, 2017, as soon as first news broke of the Strzok-Page texts, Bob Parry and I compared notes by phone. We agreed that this was quite big and that, clearly, Russia-gate had begun to morph into something like FBI-gate. It was rare for Bob to call me before he wrote; in retrospect, it seemed to have been merely a sanity check.

The piece Bob posted early the following morning was typical Bob. Many of those who click on the link will be surprised that, last December, he already had pieced together most of the story. Sadly, it turned out to be Bob’s last substantive piece before he fell seriously ill. Earlier last year he had successfully shot down other Russia-gate-related canards on which he found Establishment media sorely lacking — “Facebook-gate,” for example.



Remarkably, it has taken another half-year for Congress and the media to address — haltingly — the significance of Deep State-gate — however easy it has become to dissect the plot, and identify the main plotters. With Bob having prepared the way with his Dec.13 article, I followed up a few weeks later with “The FBI Hand Behind Russia-gate,” in the process winning no friends among those still suffering from the highly resistant HWHW virus.

VIPS

Parry also deserves credit for his recognition and appreciation of the unique expertise and analytical integrity among Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) and giving us a secure, well respected home at Consortium News.



It is almost exactly a year since Bob took a whole lot of flak for publishing what quickly became VIPS’ most controversial, and at the same time perhaps most important, Memorandum For the President; namely, “Intelligence Veterans Challenge ‘Russia Hack’ Evidence.”



Critics have landed no serious blows on the key judgments of that Memorandum, which rely largely on the type of forensic evidence that Comey failed to ensure was done by his FBI because the Bureau never seized the DNC server. Still more forensic evidence has become available over recent months soon to be revealed on Consortium News, confirming our conclusions.

Ray McGovern works with Tell the Word, a publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in inner-city Washington. He was a CIA analyst for 27 years and, in retirement, co-founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.

“We estimate that there are some 200-250 civilian casualties, according to the latest unverified numbers,” he said, citing information from the Red Cross in Afghanistan.

Ghazni, in the east of Afghanistan, is one of the country’s largest cities and home to around 270,000 people. It is just the latest place to be affected by an uptick in violence in a country that has experienced more than three decades of protracted conflict, seriously hampering poverty reduction and development.

Although Taliban fighters have been largely driven out of Ghazni city centre after last week’s attacks, house-to-house “clearing operations” are ongoing, according to OCHA.

Amid continuing insecurity, the remaining 25 to 30 aid organizations with a presence in the city “have basically hunkered down”, the agency’s spokesperson told journalists in Geneva.

There are reports of unaccompanied minors turning up at the hospital, looking for their families. - Jens Laerke (OCHA)

In the meantime, fighting has reportedly moved to the outskirts of the city, with Taliban fighters slowly withdrawing towards surrounding villages.

But aid workers - and food - still cannot reach the city because of the presence of lethal booby traps, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

“One of the main reasons for that is that there are IEDs and mines on the way,” Laerke said. “We do have capacity to actually spot and map where these mines are, but we do not have the capacity to remove them. That is the responsibility and within the capacity of the national government to do so.”

Parts of one of the main access roads, Highway 1, have been reportedly “destroyed, contested or contaminated” with IEDs, according to OCHA, which noted in a statement that the weapons had also been placed along the city’s ring road.

The development follows an uptick in violence in Afghanistan, where 80 so-called conflict incidents were recorded daily between July and September, 2017 – the highest number in six years – the UN agency has reported.

Last year also saw 16 district administrative centres attacked and taken over by the Taliban, OCHA said.

Earlier this week, UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged warring parties in Afghanistan to step up efforts towards achieving peace following deadly fighting in Ghazni, after condemning a “heinous” suicide bombing that killed dozens of students – many of them teenagers - at an education centre in the capital, Kabul.

In a bid to assess needs in Ghazni, OCHA has asked local aid workers still in the city to gather information on the number of people requiring help.

Key priorities include restoring the city’s public services. Parts of the water system are functioning again, according to the authorities, and UN Children’s Fund UNICEF, is preparing to dispatch chlorine to flush network clean.

Mobile phone networks are also gradually being restored but electricity in the city is reportedly still largely unavailable, OCHA said in a statement.

“The immediate restoration of electricity, to ensure water supply, is a top priority,” spokesperson Laerke explained.

Other priorities include providing assistance to all those affected by the violence, particularly youngsters.

“We expect that there will be a very big need for psycho-social support amongst the residents including for children,” Laerke said. “There are reports of unaccompanied minors turning up at the hospital, looking for their families.”

According to OCHA, 3.3 million people need humanitarian assistance, and there are growing signs that what was once a low-intensity conflict has now escalated into an escalating war, according to a UN strategic review.","Ghazni, in the east of Afghanistan, is one of the country’s largest cities and home to around 270,000 people.

128,https://news.mongabay.com/2018/08/not-doing-anything-is-no-longer-acceptable-qa-with-alice-thomas-climate-refugee-expert/,"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Mongabay.com,"‘Not doing anything is no longer acceptable’: Q&A with Alice Thomas, climate refugee expert","Mongabay spoke with Alice Thomas, an expert on climate refugees, about the growing impact of climate change on the refugee crisis worldwide.

To date, no one has been able to claim asylum due to climate change because the official definition of a refugee does not allow for climate-induced migration.

One of the least-understood aspects of climate migration, however, is that most migrants won’t be leaving their country, but will be moving within their national borders.

Smarter, better policies could not only mitigate such migrations, but allow communities to adapt to ongoing changes due to climate change, Thomas says.

In many ways, 2018 is the year of the refugee. At U.S. borders, Mediterranean shores and Asian cities, millions are fleeing war, hunger and persecution in search of safety and shelter. And scientists believe things will only get worse due to climate change.

The Office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that rising seas, intensifying droughts and other extreme weather events will uproot 250 million people by 2050. Like most other refugees, climate refugees are expected to come largely from developing nations in Africa, Asia and South America. But unlike those escaping war and persecution, climate refugees have few legal protections.

“The 1951 Refugee Convention’s definition of ‘refugee’ does not include people who are fleeing environmental stress,” says Alice Thomas, the climate displacement program manager at the nonprofit group Refugees International (RI). To date, no individual has been able to successfully claim asylum on the grounds that they are fleeing climate change, Thomas says, though some have tried.

And there is another climate reality, according to Thomas, that is rarely recognized: the fact that most climate-affected migrants will not be leaving their countries.

“International migration is really complex. Most people, the poorest people, can’t afford to migrate internationally,” she says. “There needs to be focus on these what we call ‘trapped populations’; people who are too poor to even move and escape climate effect.”

A 2018 World Bank report suggests that these trapped populations might number over 140 million people by 2050. That’s why Thomas says countries worldwide need an internal migration policy. Such policies should help people who need to move and resettle within their own nation so they are not stateless. Smart climate change adaptation policies may even make it possible so that people don’t have to move in the first place.

“They need to build resilience to more drought. They need to build houses that are hurricane and flood proof,” Thomas says. “That’s why it’s the poorest people who are most affected. People living in informal homes or shacks in Bangladesh or Haiti or even in Puerto Rico are among those who will be worst-affected and most likely to be compelled to move.”

Thomas has been working on these very issues for nearly a decade. In an interview with Bhanu Sridharan for Mongabay, the former environmental lawyer breaks down the issue of climate migration and steps that need to be taken both internationally and by individual nations to help the most vulnerable adapt to a crisis not of their making.

Mongabay: How did you become interested in climate change and the potential for climate change to lead to migration and the refugee crisis?

Alice Thomas: I am an environmental lawyer. I have practiced international environmental law and policy for most of my career. When Refugees International decided to start this program, there really weren’t any other organizations at that time [2009] that were focused on the need to do advocacy around the human impacts of climate change, specifically on displacement and migration. I was very interested in this job because I was very interested in defending communities who were vulnerable to climate change and because those who were most likely to be impacted were those who had the least responsibility for the climate crisis.

Can you tell us a little bit more about Refugees International? What is your organization’s objective with regard to climate migration?

Refugees International is an independent nongovernment organization that advocates for improved assistance and protection for refugees, those who are displaced internally within their own countries, and who are displaced by other events like climate change, disasters and gang violence. The organization has been around for almost four decades advocating for refugees around the world. It is a totally independent organization. We don’t take any U.N. funding and we don’t take any government funding. And that allows us to advocate fiercely only on behalf of displaced people who are our constituents.

RI’s climate displacement program is focused on different countries that are experiencing climate stress. One goal has been to improve international protection for people who are forced to flee their home countries because of climate change. The other goal has been to find ways to improve the response to people who are displaced by extreme weather or climate change-related effects.

Human beings have been moving because of environmental changes for millennia. What is the difference between that and the climate migration we see today?

Well, it’s true that people have been moving for millennia. Migration has always been an adaptation strategy for people who are experiencing environmental stress. To this day, in large parts of Africa, pastoralists move because they need to go where there’s pasture and there’s water.

The problem with climate change is that it takes us outside the historic bounds of weather and climate ranges that people have adapted to over millennia. It’s taking us into extremes beyond what’s normal. People can’t adapt to those changes fast enough.

For example, in Africa, especially the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa, people are extremely vulnerable to even minor changes in weather and climate. They are extremely poor and depend solely on rain-fed agriculture to survive. Their planting seasons correspond to rainy seasons that occur maybe twice a year. Once it starts raining, they’ll plant and harvest their crop. But now what they are seeing — and I’ve witnessed this when I visited — is that the patterns of rain are no longer normal. The rains will start on time, and they will go out and plant, but then the rains will just stop, and their crops will wither and die. These changes in rainfall patterns can affect their ability to grow food. And because it’s outside the normal pattern, they can’t predict or plan for it.

Most people use the term “climate refugee.” But people who are displaced by environmental events can’t claim asylum or protection as refugees right now. Why is that?

That’s correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention’s definition of “refugee” does not include people who are fleeing environmental stress. Other regional conventions could potentially cover people who are fleeing climate change-related effects. But there haven’t been any cases that I am aware of where people have been granted asylum only on the grounds that they were fleeing climate change. There was one case in New Zealand where someone from [the islands of] Kiribati tried to claim asylum on that ground. But the court found that there was not a sufficient showing of climate impacts on that person to qualify for asylum.

Your organization has been engaged in the development of the U.N. Global Compact on Refugees and Migration recently. Was this issue raised in the meeting? Are there steps being taken now to correct this?

There are actually two global compacts happening in parallel. One is a Global Compact on Refugees and the other is a Global Compact on Migration. The Refugees Compact is limited in scope to refugees as defined under the 1951 Convention. So it will not end up being a document that would broaden the definition of a refugee to include persons forced to flee the effects of climate change. And that’s not what it was trying to do. It was trying to address the current refugee crisis. But it acknowledges that there may be forms of mixed movement where people may be trying to flee both conflict and the effects of climate change.

The Global Compact on Migration is a different beast. It is setting out new (non-binding) commitments by governments around the world with respect to international migration. There is consensus in the room among U.N. member states that there needs to be cooperation on how to address the issue of climate- and disaster-induced migration. And there’s recognition that the countries that are going to be the worst impacted by this, especially small island developing states, really need to have new opportunities for migration for their people.

What sorts of solutions are being looked at with small island developing states?

The small island developing states have been for a long time — gosh, probably more than a decade — asking the international community to do something about the risk that they are facing. They have brought this issue to the U.N. Human Rights Council and there’s recognition that this is a violation of their peoples’ human rights and a threat to their existence. But there’s been no real solution to this.

We are now aware that the impacts of climate change are already locked in for small island states. Given that reality, they are now urging the international community to support them to adapt to those effects, including expanding legal migration pathways.

What role does the Paris Agreement play in dealing with this issue?

Climate change as a driver of migration and displacement has been recognized earlier by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the U.N. climate convention. The Paris accord set up a task force in late 2015 to look at measures to avert, minimize and address climate displacement. The task force is now working to develop a set of recommendations that it will be sharing at the upcoming climate talks in Poland, at the end of this year. And countries need to start looking at those recommendations and adopting them in their national plan of action. And we need to ensure that countries that need financial assistance to implement those measures get financial assistance.

Refugees are increasingly unwelcome in big developed nations like the U.S. and parts of the EU. Do these countries have a different stance on climate migrants?

The U.S. has traditionally been and continues to be the lead donor for humanitarian assistance globally. However, the current administration’s proposed budget sought to slash humanitarian aid and that’s including to countries that have been the worst affected by climate change. Luckily, we continue to have bipartisan support in Congress for humanitarian assistance programs. So proposals by the administration to significantly cut back humanitarian aid have been rejected and humanitarian support maintained, although it is still nowhere near as much as is needed.

But we still need to see more investment for disaster risk reduction and much more for climate change adaptation. Even under former administrations, [the U.S.] hadn’t done enough to help countries adapt to climate change, but it was making an effort. Under this administration we have seen funding for climate change adaptation zeroed out.

Europe in this time period has really stepped up a lot in dealing with climate mitigation and humanitarian assistance, but unfortunately they do not have a very friendly refugee or migration policy right now. Canada has emerged as a real leader in all ways.

A lot of migration is internal, i.e. people moving within their own country. Are you concerned about that aspect as well? Or are you only concerned when people have to leave their nation-state and move to another country?

Right now, the evidence shows that most people [affected by climate change] will migrate or be displaced internally. So it needs to be addressed. And I feel there is a lot of opportunity in the coming decade to prevent this sort of migration. To help people who don’t want to move and stay in place adapt.

But for those migrating, we also need to prepare for that as well. Part of the problem is that there’s no policy for internal migration in most countries. This has all come to a head in Alaska, where impoverished indigenous communities want to relocate because the Arctic is warming so quickly. There are dozens of native Alaskan communities that want to move inland, because they are literally falling into the water as the permafrost melts beneath them. They don’t even want to move very far inland. But there is no legal or administrative framework to do that. They don’t have federal or state funds to set up infrastructure in advance of their move. So this lack of policies and laws for internal migration is also a very big gap right now.

Do you think focusing on poverty alleviation or infrastructure in the countries impacted may help?

Fighting poverty will help, but all of our policies, whether humanitarian strategies or development strategies, need to incorporate climate change. They need to do things differently than they did in the past. They need to build resilience to more drought. They need to build houses that are hurricane- and flood-proof. That’s why it’s the poorest people who are most affected. People living in informal homes or shacks in Bangladesh or Haiti or even in Puerto Rico are among those who will be worst-affected and most likely to be compelled to move.

Are there any wealthy communities that have also been forced to move because of climate stress?

It’s almost always that poor communities don’t have the resources to move and those are the people we are focused on. But if you look at Hurricane Katrina [in New Orleans], you had a city with both poor and rich communities. A lot of wealthy people with means who lost their homes in the storm were able to rebuild their homes to better standards or they just went somewhere else. They were able to find what we call a “durable solution” to their displacement. What the evidence shows is that the people who didn’t find a durable solution to displacement were poor African-American communities living in the Lower Ninth ward.

I think that after disasters, wealthy people are able to rebuild or move. They did so in the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma and in Puerto Rico. But the people who lived in the trailer parks in the Keys, I don’t know what happened to those people.

I think the issue of climate migration garnered a lot of attention because of the Syrian crisis, the idea that a drought led to the civil war and that led to displacement. What do you think?

With respect to Syria, I haven’t analyzed the situation myself, but I think the literature shows that it hasn’t been firmly established that there was a direct link between the drought and civil war. And that corresponds to the broader literature. There are not many cases where climate events, like droughts, directly led people to pick up arms and go to war with each other. Rather, the evidence shows that climate-related disasters can lead to other forms of social stress or mental stress. They can also aggravate pre-existing tension. Where societies are predisposed to racial or ethnic tensions, climate change can aggravate the situation.

Are there any examples of this?

Well, in Somalia there’s been another very protracted drought and more than 800,000 people have been internally displaced. And there the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab has been taking advantage of this and intimidating people who need food and water. They have been blocking humanitarian aid from coming into affected areas.

Mostly this doesn’t sound like a cheerful job. Are you optimistic that progress will be made?

As much as I have been frustrated by the slow pace of action, the fact that you’re seeing this climate displacement task force within the UNFCCC and the Global Compacts on Migration and Refugees trying to create international cooperation on this, represents important progress. When I started eight years ago, we didn’t have that. So we have seen that discussions have moved; states have moved. Even in a really bad political climate, even in a xenophobic political climate, even in an anti-refugee political climate, we have seen common sense and human morality prevail. Not doing anything is no longer acceptable.

Smarter, better policies could not only mitigate such migrations, but allow communities to adapt to ongoing changes due to climate change, Thomas says.
Like most other refugees, climate refugees are expected to come largely from developing nations in Africa, Asia and South America.
To date, no individual has been able to successfully claim asylum on the grounds that they are fleeing climate change, Thomas says, though some have tried.
Mongabay: How did you become interested in climate change and the potential for climate change to lead to migration and the refugee crisis?"

No More Hiroshimas, No More Nagasakis, No More Hibakusha

Viewpoint by António Guterres

The survivors of the atomic bombings, known in Japanese as the hibakusha, have become global ""leaders for peace and disarmament"", United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said at the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony in Japan on 9 August 2018, commemorating the 73rd anniversary of that devastating day. Following are extensive extracts from Guterres' remarks. – The Editor

NAGASAKI (IDN-INPS) – I am humbled, as Secretary-General of the United Nations, to be here with you to commemorate the women, men and children killed by the nuclear attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. I convey my deepest respect and condolences to everyone here today, and to all the victims and survivors of the atomic bombs.

It is a great personal pleasure to be here in Nagasaki. My country, Portugal, has deep political, cultural and religious ties with this city, going back nearly five centuries. But Nagasaki is not just an international city with a long and fascinating history. It is a global inspiration for all those who seek to create a safer and more secure world. This city, your city, is a beacon of hope and strength, and a monument to the resilience of its people.

The atomic bomb that killed and injured tens of thousands of people in the immediate aftermath of the blast, and in the years and decades that followed, could not crush your spirit. The survivors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the hibakusha, have become leaders for peace and disarmament here in Japan and around the world. They are defined not by the cities that were destroyed, but by the peace that the world needs and they seek to build.

From the other side of the apocalypse, the hibakusha have raised their voices on behalf of the entire human family. We must listen. There can be no more Hiroshimas, no more Nagasakis, and so no more hibakusha.

Sadly, 73 years on, fears of nuclear war are still with us. Millions of people, including here in Japan, live in a shadow cast by the dread of unthinkable carnage. States in possession of nuclear weapons are spending vast sums to modernize their arsenals.

More than $1.7 trillion was spent in 2017 on arms and armies – the highest level since the end of the cold war and around 80 times the amount needed for global humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, disarmament processes have slowed and even come to a halt. Many States demonstrated their frustration by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last year.

Let us also recognize the persistent peril of other deadly weapons. Chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, and those being developed for cyberwarfare, pose a grave threat. And conflicts fought with conventional weapons are lasting longer and are becoming more deadly for civilians. There is an urgent need for disarmament of all kinds, but especially nuclear disarmament. This is the backdrop of the global disarmament initiative that I launched in May.

Disarmament is a driving force for maintaining international peace and security. It is a tool for ensuring national security. It helps to uphold the principles of humanity, promote sustainable development and protect civilians.

My agenda for disarmament is based on concrete measures that will lower the risk of nuclear annihilation, prevent conflict of all kinds, and reduce the suffering that the proliferation and use of arms causes to civilians. The agenda makes clear that nuclear weapons undermine global, national and human security.

The total elimination of nuclear weapons remains the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations. Here in Nagasaki, I call on all countries to commit to nuclear disarmament and to start making visible progress as a matter of urgency. Nuclear-weapon States have a special responsibility to lead. Let Nagasaki and Hiroshima remind us to put peace first every day; to work on conflict prevention and resolution, reconciliation and dialogue; and to tackle the roots of conflict and violence.

Peace is not an abstract concept and it does not come about by chance. Peace is tangible, and it can be built by hard work, solidarity, compassion and respect. Out of the horror of the atomic bomb, we can reach a deeper understanding of our irreducible bonds of responsibility to each other. Let us all commit to making Nagasaki the last place on earth to suffer nuclear devastation. I will work with you to that end. [IDN-InDepthNews – 09 August 2018]

Colombia has experienced internal armed conflict for the last 50 years. The conflict has been waged primarily in rural areas and over control of territory, particularly in regions characterized by weak institutions and, in many cases, corruption and cronyism, impunity, expansion of illicit crop cultivation, and weak civil society links to state institutions owing to lack of opportunities for participation (World Bank 2013:1). Over time, the conflict has spawned a complex array of non-state actors who have waged terror as a weapon of war. Specifically, their modus operandi has included systematic largescale human rights violations, such as public executions, disappearances, massacres, town take-overs, extortions, assassinations, kidnappings, and forced recruitment of children.

The internal armed conflict has had a negative impact on the social and economic development of the country. Armed conflict has disrupted the productive use of assets and work; it has hindered legal economic activity; and propelled families into limited employment and poverty (World Bank 2015). Conflict has generated millions of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). According to estimates from the Unit for the Assistance and Comprehensive Reparations to Victims, over 7 million people had been registered as IDPs in Colombia as of March 2018—amounting to 15 percent of the population. IDPs have lower standards of living compared to those who have not been displaced (World Bank 2015).

Against this backdrop of conflict and violence, the World Bank provided support through the Peace and Development Project (PDP) “to assist vulnerable, low-income and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the conflict-affected regions to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects.” The PDP design included four main outcome areas based on assumptions that were required to achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO).

These outcome areas were:

• Outcome Area #1/Assumption: Achieving socioeconomic stabilization of vulnerable and displaced populations. The project understood socioeconomic stabilization as developing social, economic, and environmental assets through a community-driven approach and it assumed that these assets can “mitigate the negative effects of conflict.

• Outcome Area #2/Assumption: Strengthening institutions and organizations at the territorial level as a precondition for carrying out a community-driven approach to development.

• Outcome Area #3/Assumption: Fostering new relationship patterns based on positive values such as trust, reciprocity, and collective action, among others through community-driven development (CDD).

• Outcome Area #4/Assumption: Protecting individuals from conflict. The theory of change assumed that the “risk of exposure to conflict” can be reduced through the increased social cohesion generated by a community-driven approach to development.

• Woven throughout the project’s theory of change is also the assumption that increased social cohesion paired with socioeconomic stabilization can play a role in deterring displacement.

To achieve its PDO, the PDP financed small-scale subprojects and capacity building activities to ensure that subprojects were selected, designed, and implemented through a community-driven approach. Overall, the PDP and its additional financing targeted six regions comprising a total of nine departments and 117 municipalities.

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessed the project’s performance in the following way:

Relevance of Objective. The PDO was highly relevant to the country priorities and to the World Bank country strategies at both the appraisal and closing stages. However, the formulation of the PDO lacked clarity and was not logically sequenced. Specifically, the PDO formulation “jumps” from the aim of “assist[ing]” vulnerable groups and IDPs to reducing their risk of conflict exposure, without indicating “how” this would be achieved.

This lack of clarity in the formulation of the PDO affected the clarity of the project’s logical frame. Overall, considering that the PDO was highly relevant to country priorities and World Bank strategies, the relevance of the PDO is rated substantial.

Relevance of Design. Subproject activities aimed at improving local livelihoods and living conditions were relevant for “mitigating the negative impact of conflict.” In turn, the project financed activities to build capacity of organizations on the ground to enable the implementation of a CDD approach that could plausibly generate new relationship patterns, increase social cohesion and, thus, “reduce the risk of exposure to conflict.” Project activities could also, in principle, affect displacement rates since there is evidence that socioeconomic stabilization paired with strengthened social cohesion can deter displacement (Adhikari 2013; Engel and Ibanez 2007). However, deterring displacement can either increase or reduce the risk of exposure to conflict. Despite the complex link between deterring displacement and “reducing the risk of exposure to conflict,” the relevance of design is rated substantial.

Efficacy. The discussion of PDO efficacy is organized around two sub-objectives: (i) “mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects” and (ii) “reduce risk of exposure to conflict.” The objective of “mitigate the negative impact of conflict” is rated substantial since the PDP contributed to socioeconomic stabilization through an increase in household assets and a positive, albeit not sustained, effect on food consumption.

Regarding the aim to “reduce the risk of exposure to conflict,” there is evidence that the PDP strengthened local institutions and organizations; increased beneficiary participation in formal and informal organizations as well as their participation in social networks that can provide economic, emergency, and legal support; and increased their likelihood of becoming leaders. However, the available evidence regarding protection against conflict is mixed. Overall, the “reduce the risk of exposure to conflict” objective is rated substantial.

Efficiency. Although implementation efficiency was substantial; the project lacked an adequate economic and financial analysis. At appraisal, the project did not attempt to calculate an ex-ante economic rate of return for the overall project given the demand driven nature of the activities. Instead, the project estimated the internal rate of return for a purposive sample of subprojects that was deemed to be representative of the subprojects to be financed under the PDP. At closing, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) did not refer nor follow up on the exercise conducted at appraisal and, thus, did not discuss the extent to which the sampled subprojects at appraisal were representative of the subprojects financed under the PDP. Instead, the ICR conducted a cost analysis in which they compared the cost per beneficiary family between the PDP and the EU funded Peace Laboratory II (World Bank 2013). The analysis concluded that the PDP project has a lower cost per beneficiary family. However, it is not possible to say whether these two programs are exactly comparable and the chosen efficiency metric (i.e. cost per family) is not precise enough since demand-driven subprojects are so different from one another.

Comparing the PDP costs in terms of assets built, benefits provided, or financial viability of subprojects would have been a more sensible approach. Overall, considering these shortcomings, efficiency is rated modest","Armed conflict has disrupted the productive use of assets and work; it has hindered legal economic activity; and propelled families into limited employment and poverty (World Bank 2015).

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

For over six decades Myanmar has endured violent conflict between the central government armed forced, called the Tatmadaw, and numerous ethnic armed groups. The complexity of the conflict lies in the multitude of actors involved and armed clashes that take place across the country, which have taken the lives of many and diminished the potential of the country. The peace process that was initiated in 2011 by the government is formed on bilateral ceasefire agreements signed between the government and Ethnic Armed Groups.

The bilateral ceasefire agreements served as a foundation for the central government, Tatmadaw, and the different ethnic armed groups to begin negotiations for a nationwide ceasefire agreement. Throughout Myanmar, there are calls for a peace process that not only stops the fighting and ends the violence, but also addresses longstanding issues that affect all communities. The forging of the ceasefire agreement in 2015 was seen as a first step in a long process that needs to address decades of resentment, marginalisation, and mistrust from the different ethnic groups across the country. Various counterinsurgency tactics employed in different ethnic states that aimed at cutting off communication and trade between the EAG and civilian communities have stunted economic and social development in most ethnic states. This has left a legacy of severe poverty and lack of communication and transportation infrastructure that remains a problem today.

As the country prepares for the third session of nationwide peace talks, the peace process is at a precarious juncture, with armed clashes continuing in Kachin state between the Tatmadaw and the KIA, and fighting in Northern Shan state between the Tatmadaw and the RCSS and TNLA. Not only have these clashes been putting the lives of communities at risk and created large numbers of IDPs in the country, but they have also undermined national trust in the sustainability of the peace process.

Other challenges to the peace process are issues of inclusivity and representation at peace dialogues. However, more recently the signing of two ethnic armed groups to the cease-fire agreement, the NMSP and LDU, bring the total signatories to ten, marking a more positive step. Besides this, the dialogues have also been criticized for not including participation from civil society groups and women. Since the Myanmar peace process has largely been a top-level process that concentrates on dialogue between the Myanmar government, Tatmadaw, and EAG leadership, communities often remain voiceless and invisible at the negotiating table.

The Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies (CPCS) recognises the importance of involving communities in the peace process. The communities are necessary partners in creating a robust and sustainable peace process. As stakeholders who have been living at the frontlines of conflict, they have valuable insights to share about the grievances that drive conflict. Listening to how the bilateral ceasefire agreements are being implemented in their areas also serves as a significant source of feedback on the positive and negative effects of the ongoing peace process at the community level.

This publication is based on research and direct engagement with communities in six ceasefire areas of the country. The overall aim of the project is to amplify the voices of communities to allow their experiences to inform and influence decision-makers, including negotiators and other key stakeholders in the country’s peace process.

From May to September 2017, 485 conversations were conducted with 1537 community members living in the six ceasefire states of: Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Northern Shan, Southern Shan, Kayah, and Mon state. Using the listening methodology, trained researchers known as listeners who are familiar with the context, culture and geography travelled to various townships across the country and had conversations with a cross- section of the states’ demographics. These conversations were focused on community opinions regarding their direct experiences living through conflict and as their country progresses through a peace process. The topics covered their daily challenges, their thoughts on the peace process and their hopes for the future.","The peace process that was initiated in 2011 by the government is formed on bilateral ceasefire agreements signed between the government and Ethnic Armed Groups.

“The continuation and further development of the DPRK’s nuclear program and related statements by the DPRK are a cause for grave concern,” said a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), referring to North Korea’s official name.

The report, published late Monday, by the director general of Yukiya Amano is to be submitted to an IAEA board meeting in September.

In 2009 Pyongyang expelled IAEA inspectors from its Yongbyon nuclear site and has since refused to allow IAEA inspections on its territory.

The watchdog has stepped up monitoring through open source information and satellite imagery, it said.

“As the Agency remains unable to carry out verification activities in the DPRK, its knowledge of the DPRK’s nuclear program is limited and, as further nuclear activities take place in the country, this knowledge is declining,” it said.

Between late-April and early-May, there were indications of the operation of the steam plant that serves the radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon site, according to the report.

However, the duration of the steam plant’s operation was not sufficient to have supported the reprocessing of a complete core from the experimental nuclear power plant reactor, it added.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump held a groundbreaking summit in Singapore in June.

At the meeting the pair struck a vague agreement to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, but there has been little movement since.

Before this, Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April for their first summit. They agreed to push for a declaration of an end to the Korean War this year.","VIENNA (Rahnuma): The UN’s nuclear watchdog said it had not seen any indication that nuclear activities in North Korea have stopped despite its pledges to denuclearize.

So, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel did what politicians often do when faced with a thorny policy challenge: They kicked the issue to a commission, with representatives from government, industry groups, labor unions and environmental organizations. The task force is supposed to negotiate a date by which coal in Germany should be phased out. It will also propose a plan to aid workers who will be hurt by the transition.

Germany has set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and another 15 percent by 2030. Many analysts think the country will miss those targets unless most coal plants either shut down or start capturing and burying their emissions by 2030.

In theory, that’s doable. Britain, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, recently enacted a carbon tax and has replaced almost all of its coal use with renewables and natural gas. (It has also kept its nuclear plants running, something German voters won’t allow.)

But Britain’s transition hasn’t been painless. South Wales, a former mining region, now struggles with high poverty and unemployment. Germany’s task force is trying to avoid that fate for its lignite communities.

Faced with a choice between cutting emissions rapidly or avoiding social disruption, the commission may opt for the latter, some analysts say. “I would be surprised if they agreed to an end date before the 2040s,” said Rebecca Bertram, an energy expert with the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Germany.

The commission’s final report is due in December, when the world’s nations will meet for a fresh round of climate talks in Poland, another European country that relies heavily on coal. What Germany decides could have ripple effects around the world.","And politicians have been reluctant to confront the influential coal industry, which employs some 32,000 workers and has been the backbone of the country’s industrial base.

Three years ago, Australia placed its national target to cut emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030 into the global Paris agreement.

Everyone, including those responsible for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, knows the targets offered up by Australia and other countries are too low to reach the goal of keeping global warming “well below 2C” – a guardrail which, many scientists now believe, was itself inadequate.

You can ask all those suffering worsening droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels whether they think things are going to get cheerier as the 1C of warming we’ve already had starts to feed back on to itself with the help of increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Outside the United States you will struggle to find any major industry association or company – including the World Coal Association – that disagrees with the Paris deal.

In Australia, all the major big business groups, from the Australian Industry Group to the Business Council of Australia to the coal-boosters at the Minerals Council of Australia, thought the Neg was a good idea. They also back Australia’s Paris targets.

What might this tell you about the Neg and its ability to move Australia away from business-as-usual to the kind of policy that would be grounded in the reality of the risks – both economic and physical – that climate change represents? It tells you that the “policy” was never about climate change.

What does it tell you about the emissions targets? It tells you that they were inadequate when it came to causing many of those big interests to invest in real change – to start to rethink their business plans to fit into a decarbonising world. Better to lobby for the status quo.

At the heart of all of this – the putrid rotten core that’s undermined all previous attempts to pull Australia and the world out of its spiral of climate impacts – has been a denial of the science of climate change.

That rejection by some right-wingers of a falsely perceived “leftist” cause of climate change has fed the policy uncertainty. Too many politicians have stood by and allowed that denial to fester.

It’s given us phrases such as “technology neutral” and “energy poverty” when what we needed to hear were phrases such as “climate leadership” and “public safety”.

Can the Australian voting public and any fair-minded politician seriously allow the country’s energy and climate “policy” to be dictated by a core led by Tony Abbott – who rejects the science that’s backed by every major scientific institution in the world?

No matter how many winks and screams you get from the conservative commentators, right-wing shock jocks and the alt-right, this is where we are at. Hostage to a groupthink that’s divorced from reality. Some people need to grow a backbone.

That’s my 30 minutes. Time’s up.","I needed to write this column really quickly, otherwise we might have had a new prime minister before I’d finished, and the climate policy we don’t have might have changed several times.
I gave myself 30 minutes because that reflects the fickle care and short-termism that has been afforded climate change in Australia in recent years.
When I say we don’t have a climate policy, that is the literal truth.
It tells you that the “policy” was never about climate change.
That rejection by some right-wingers of a falsely perceived “leftist” cause of climate change has fed the policy uncertainty."

‘We do not inherit the earth from our parents; we borrow it from our children’ – Indian Proverb

On 5th January 1931, Rwandan King Yuhi V - Musinga wrote a sad letter to his daughter Musheshembugu. He had learned that she was about to be baptised.

‘I learned that your husband wants you to be baptised. I want to tell you that what you are about to do is an abomination. You shall not prosper. You will be cursed by King of the earth Musinga himself and King of above, the Thunder… I tell you in the name of Rwabugili my father, if you become Christian, you and I will never meet again. Feel free to speak ill of me to the priests all you want. I don’t mind…’

His daughter didn’t listen to him and got baptised alongside her husband Rwagataraka, a traitor. Soon after, King Musinga was deposed and exiled to Kamembe in western Rwanda, then to Moba in Eastern Congo where he rested.

His eldest son, King Mutara III Rudahigwa, succeeded him, but he was assassinated by the very people who had baptised his sister and replaced by a personal assistant to Catholic bishop Perraudin, Gregoire Kayibanda.

In the last few days, two famous commoners and a queen passed away. While the Queen (of Soul) will reign forever unchallenged; the two men’s demise sparked controversy on their place in history.

The two men are Koffi Annan and John McCain. Everyone knows the Queen and I choose, out of R.E.S.P.E.C.T., to refrain from mentioning her name in the same sentence as these men.

I am not about to reopen the debate on the two men’s deeds, I just want to negate the so-called ‘African culture’ of ‘not speaking ill of the dead’, with which commentators bullied us, unsuccessfully when we pointed out to the suffering that these celebrated men have brought to mankind.

I believe there is no such culture; at least not anymore. In 2018, we are no longer that superstitious. While no human is perfect, everyone must be held accountable; dead or alive.

What’s in fact pervasive of African leaders is to think that if they hang on to power until their death, all will somehow be forgiven and forgotten because they are now dead.

This is why we have politicians, proudly bearing names of their ruthless parents, enjoying stolen riches, fame and abundance, while orphans of their parents’ victims live lowly in anonymous poverty, with no chance at moral or material reparation.

This is the same attitude as that of egotistic politicians who deny the existence of global warming. It is not that they aren’t aware of its existence; they just know that they will be long gone before any major consequences occur, and no one will remember their hand in it.

The same attitude animates descendants of slave-masters and colonisers, who now feel qualified to advise us on our new relationship with the Chinese, a nation and a people which has done us no harm in history, ever.

I am here to say we may have forgiven, but we have not forgotten. History will hold them accountable for their deeds today, and their names will forever be associated with a dark era, originator of natural calamities, and human tragedy.

Also, I know that a crime is personal, but the Bible says that some sins must be visited upon third, at times fourth generations. I am entirely for the banning of children of bad people from running in politics; for seizing all their inherited wealth and distributing it to the poor.

I want African leaders to know that their deeds will be visited upon themselves, their offspring, relatives and friends; I want children, relatives and surviving associates to confront their ageing fathers and brother-in-arms while still alive and compel them not destroy their legacies, lest it be visited upon them.

I am privileged to have this column. I will always have one; here or elsewhere. And with it I will lend my voice to the downtrodden, the silent, the broken and the unmitigated. Those who carry the weight of forgiveness and reconciliation; not its rewards.

I will remind these leaders of ours, who start off as good men, then grow drunk of their own power; that they are in power not because we love them; we don’t! Those who praise them are only trying to extort them – as they do us. They are in power because they are violent, and so will their end be.

I will remind those Africans who go on to receive accolades, praises and prizes from our oppressors, dress lavishly and speak ostentatiously, that we are not impressed. They may be praised by those whom they served to our detriment, but in our midst, they will always be regarded as lost children.

I will remind their offspring, relatives and associates that they will never be legitimate in our eyes; that while they feel all powerful and famous, their image whitewashed, we know where they come from; we know that they never earned any of that power, nor do they deserve it; in our eyes they will always be imposters, usurpers, and they will never change history.

May he who has ears, hear…

I will leave you with this passage from the Wrecked of Earth: ‘Europeans undertook to manufacture a native elite. They picked out promising adolescents; they branded them, as with a red-hot iron, with the principles of Western culture; they stuffed their mouths full with high-sounding phrases, grand glutinous words that stuck to the teeth. After a short stay in the mother country they were sent home, whitewashed, walking lies with nothing left to say to their brothers; they only echoed.

In my heart I am a South African. But for a short time I had nothing to prove this. This was terrifying, although I am in the lucky position to have an ID number and I am on the system. I was thus able to replace my most important document with relative ease.

Many people battle for years to try to prove who they are. I again realised it recently when desperate “faceless people” yet again had to turn to court to be able to belong somewhere

The Department of Home Affairs will not simply issue birth certificates and ID documents without being thoroughly convinced the person it issued one of these documents to was indeed South African.

But, on the other hand, even being a legal citizen can be hard to prove with often incompetent officials who do not really care to assist. Sometimes things are out of your hands, as in the case of a Cape Town father, who only realised five years ago that his now 11-year-old daughter’s birth was never registered.

This was not his fault. He made use of a private company when his daughter was born to register her birth.

He filled in the required documents and paid the fee. Ten days later the birth certificate was delivered at the hospital.

All went well and the father was even able to obtain a passport for his daughter. But to his shock he discovered five years ago that the birth certificate was fraudulent. This was when her passport had lapsed and he wanted to renew it.

Home Affairs told the father his daughter was not on their system.

This was the start of the father’s uphill battle to try to obtain a legal birth certificate for his daughter. He visited various Home Affairs offices and filled in the required documents.

The department questioned why the father did not have the proof of his application for the birth certificate 11 years ago. The father said he did not keep it. Who would after all these years?

The company did not respond and the hospital simply said it was not liable.

The child is meanwhile being home schooled, as no school wanted to accept her without any valid papers.

The father said it is a major problem, as his child is faceless. She cannot participate in any extramural activities and no school wanted to take her in. But the biggest problem is that without a birth certificate, she cannot obtain an ID document. Without this, she can basically not function as an adult, as she won’t be able to open a bank account or get a job.

The court ordered that Home Affairs had to tissue her with a birth certificate within 14 days.

In the same court a judge ordered that a boy, aged 12, be declared a South African citizen.

His parents managed to obtain this order with the help of Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR).

The department refused to register his birth, as in the case of the 11-year-old, despite his right to be recognised as a South African citizen. This had also left him effectively stateless.

Two unknown children had been registered under his mother’s name at Home Affairs. One child was born a month after him and the department refused to register two children born within a month of each other.

Despite her complaints to remove the other children, Home Affairs had not investigated the matter since 2007.

The child remained unregistered despite being a South African citizen by law. His school refused him to further attend without a birth certificate. His mother was forced to send him to KwaZulu-Natal, where a rural school agreed to accept him.

In this case the court also intervened and ordered the department to issue him with a birth certificate.

LHR said it was concerned that the department’s lack of service delivery was rendering children stateless.

It said there was an urgent need for an independent complaints body (an ombudsman) for the department. It said Home Affairs had a long way to go to realise that these children had rights.

A birth certificate is the first step to “belong”, as Frederik Ngubane, who was born in South Africa realised. He lost his birth certificate when the taxi he was in was hijacked. All his belongings, including his birth certificate, were stolen.

Home Affairs refused to issue him with a South African ID, as he was unable to provide documented evidence that he was born here. Ngubane said his only evidence that he was a South African was his birth certificate.

The court referred the matter back to Home Affairs for a proper investigation into his circumstances.

According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, statelessness is a reality for about two million people around the world. It is a sad reality with dire consequences for many.

137,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/world-humanitarian-day-protecting-civilian-workers,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Himalayan Times,World Humanitarian Day: Protecting civilian workers,"The joint action of governments, civil society, NGOs and INGOs, and international community is the best recipe to ensure that disaster risks are prevented or mitigated whenever possible

This year’s World Humanitarian Day, which took place on August 19, marks the fifteenth anniversary since the attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq which killed 22 people, including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. In 2008, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 19th August as World Humanitarian Day.

For the last ten years, World Humanitarian Day has brought people around the world together to rally support for people living in humanitarian crises and to pay tribute to the aid workers who assist them. In 2017 on World Humanitarian Day more than two million people took social action through the #NotATarget campaign and urged global leaders to do a better job of protecting civilians, humanitarian and health workers in conflict zones. The event was marked here in Nepal.

The UN estimates that in 2017 more than 26,000 civilians were killed or injured in targeted or indiscriminate attacks in six countries. Since the attack on the Canal Hotel fifteen years ago more than 4,000 humanitarian workers have been killed, injured, detained, kidnapped and prevented from supporting people in need. In the first three months of 2018, there have been 149 attacks on health workers, health facilities and hospitals across 13 countries. Such attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel in these 13 countries have resulted in 221 deaths - over half of them in Syria.

Those humanitarian personnel and civilians living in conflict affected locations continue to face such grave risks is unconscionable and deeply shameful. On World Humanitarian Day we reflect on these sombre statistics and collectively we call for change.

In 2018 the #NotATarget campaign reaffirms the world’s commitment to the norms that uphold humanity and recognises the courage, compassion and selflessness of humanitarians.

Thankfully Nepal does not suffer from the egregious violence that has blighted Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries. And unlike many countries humanitarian personnel in Nepal are not subjected to armed attacks, arrest or detention.

I believe the answer is obvious: In recent years millions of Nepalis have suffered hugely as a result of natural disasters and humanitarian workers across the country have been instrumental in responding to their needs. It is appropriate that we recognize and applaud the work of community volunteers and staff from the Nepal Red Cross Society, national and international non-government organizations and UN agencies who have worked tirelessly in their endeavours to address human suffering. Drought, floods, landslides and major damaging earthquakes have rocked Nepal in the last five years.

On World Humanitarian Day, it is important to remember as well that despite the assistance brought to affected populations by these dedicated humanitarian workers, people continue to suffer long after the disasters have occurred; the long list includes families still homeless and awaiting the much needed support to rebuild their houses, those whose livelihoods were destroyed and continue, to this day, to face hardship and poverty being deprived of their means of subsistence. So, let us not forget those Nepalis whose lives have been disrupted and who are still experiencing privations owing to the impact of past disasters. Only 12 months ago more than 1 million Nepalis were affected by monsoon flooding. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed with economic losses estimated at more than US$584 million.

National governments are, of course, primarily responsible for the safety and well-being of its citizens before, during and after disasters have occurred. In Nepal this obligation is taken seriously. For example, in September 2017 Nepal’s parliament passed the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act.

The act paves the way for the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority and makes clear how Nepal will manage those risks that it is exposed to. More generally the act signals Nepal’s commitment to disaster mitigation and preparedness. It makes clear Nepal’s wish to limit human suffering through proactive action.

I would like to use the tenth World Humanitarian Day to not only praise the efforts of humanitarian personnel in Nepal but to acknowledge the leadership of the government also. I would also like to recognize that the joint action of governments, civil society, NGOs and INGOs, and international community is the best recipe to ensure that disaster risks are prevented or mitigated whenever possible, and that affected populations - who are often the most destitute and excluded - are assisted, their lives saved and their livelihoods protected or rebuilt to avoid the tragic vicious cycle of disaster and poverty.

In Nepal we are fortunate to have a proactive government, a vibrant civil society and a committed international community that have taken important steps to protect the people of Nepal through disaster mitigation and preparedness efforts. Long may this collaboration continue.

Finally, let me remind you that civilians and, of course, humanitarian workers are #NotATarget There are rules governing combatants’ behaviour in war. Every time those rules are broken, human suffering intensifies.

138,https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/toxic-air-to-blame-for-lung-cancer-no-longer-just-a-smokers-disease,"Fri, 03 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",BloombergQuint,Toxic Air To Blame For Lung Cancer; No Longer Just A Smoker’s Disease,"Smokers and non-smokers now represent an equal number of lung-cancer patients, according to a study carried out by the Lung Care Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation focused on improving lung health in India.

An analysis of 150 patients at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH), New Delhi, found that close to 50 percent of patients with lung cancer–the type of cancer responsible for the highest number of cancer deaths nationwide–had never smoked, and yet had developed the pulmonary disease.

Health professionals in India now believe there is strong evidence that points to the role of air pollution in the increasing incidence of lung cancer amongst the young and female populations.

“This is the first time I have seen this 1:1 ratio of smokers to non-smokers suffering from lung cancer”, Arvind Kumar, chairman, centre for chest surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, told IndiaSpend. “Looking at this data, the obvious reason that comes to mind is air pollution, which contains smoke and PM 2.5.”

PM 2.5 is particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in size, or 30 times finer than a human hair, which, when inhaled deeply into the lungs is known to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Outdoor pollution was classified as a cancer-causing agent in 2013 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health Organization.

In November 2017, a public-health emergency was declared by the Indian Medical Association in Delhi as the air quality index breached 999, likened to smoking 50 cigarettes a day.

Currently, lung cancer is responsible for five deaths per 1,000 in India (seven per 1,000 in Delhi, a city that regularly experiences high levels of air pollution) and is accompanied by a survival rate of no more than five years.

The effects of air pollution on respiratory and lung health–typically associated with decades of smoking tobacco and tobacco-related products–have become a growing focus for medical researchers and health workers, as awareness of health hazards amongst the public has risen.

In 2013, an eight-year-old girl in China became the youngest person in that country, and possibly the world, to be diagnosed with lung cancer, as a result of exposure to polluted air. She lived beside a busy road and was over-exposed to PM 2.5.

Patients Are Younger, More Females And Non-Smokers

Lung cancer is no longer “a smoker’s disease, a disease of old age and [one of] strong male preponderance”, according to the Lung Care Foundation study.

Nearly 21 percent of patients analysed in the 2018 study are under 50 years old. Of this group, five out of 31 patients are between 21 and 30 years of age, representing 3.3 percent of the total patient group.

Compare this to 70 years ago, when the proportion of cancer patients under 30 was 2.5 percent, according to a study conducted across 15 teaching hospitals between 1955-59.","Smokers and non-smokers now represent an equal number of lung-cancer patients, according to a study carried out by the Lung Care Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation focused on improving lung health in India.

But one housekeeper in Mumbai is challenging the expectation to be submissive and obedient by lampooning the world of domestic employment in a standup routine several nights a week.

“Although my employers were mostly nice to me, I used to hear horror stories from other maids,” Deepika Mhatre, 43, told the Guardian. “I used my experiences for my routine, like other comedians,” she said.

Mhatre’s daily routine hardly lent itself to laughs. Her day would start at 4am. From 4.30 she travelled on various commuter trains, selling imitation jewellery to passengers on their way to work in downtown Mumbai. By 7am she arrived at the first of five homes in Malad where she cooked.

At 2pm she would leave for the 90-minute journey home, where she did her household chores, looked after her ailing, asthmatic husband, who has not worked for 15 years, and their three daughters, and bought and packed jewellery for the next day.

It’s the first opportunity I’ve ever had to be someone Deepika Mhatre

At 6pm she would start cooking dinner for the family. These days, however, in the evenings she catches a train into town and performs at one of Mumbai’s comedy clubs.

Standup comedy in India is in its infancy. The humour Indians enjoy in private is missing from public life and entertainment, and Bollywood’s idea of humour is slapstick. A maid doing standup comedy is unheard of.

On stage, a matronly figure in a salwar kameez and dupatta – a long scarf – with her long hair tied back, she tells the audience she is special. So special that in the building where she works, she says, they have installed a special lift just for her. She pauses. In the homes where she works, they even have special plates and glasses just for her, she says.



It takes a second or two before the audience understands that she is satirising the habit across India of forcing domestic staff – maids, cooks, nannies and drivers – to use separate elevators so they don’t “pollute” the lifts used by the rich residents, and to eat off separate plates.

“That’s fine. Go and hide your precious utensils that I am not allowed to use,” continues Mhatre. “But whose hands made the chapattis you eat? And whose hands apply the balm when a tired madam [lady of the house] needs a massage?”

Mhatre goes on to talk about how maids have to sit on the floor, use a separate chair or stand in a corner, and she makes fun of how the rich haggle with the poor over a few measly rupees but will happily pay whatever price is marked on goods in a swanky mall.

Mhatre’s sets can be seen as an attack on India’s extreme social inequality, and the inability of the rich to treat the poor as their equals. “Why do they do this? It’s because they have no heart, no feeling for poor people,” she said.

Mhatre had always made her family crack up. But it was only when one of her employers, Sangeeta Vyas - who Mhatre says was much nicer than most – one day arranged a talent show for people who work as maids or drivers that Mhatre got a chance to perform. “All the other participants sang or danced. I got on stage and talked about madams. The audience liked it.”

After a journalist heard about her, she was invited to perform at gigs and received encouragement from Aditi Mittal, a Mumbai comedian who has a web show called Bad Girls, which features unconventional women doing unconventional things. Her two-minute routine has gradually expanded to 10 minutes. “She can mine this madam material – their classist and superior ways – for ages because their behaviour is so ridiculous,” said Mittal.

Making fun of oneself is not common in India, where blowing one’s own trumpet is more widespread, but audiences seem to appreciate her self-deprecation – despite the fact that, as Mittal says, she speaks truth to power.

The gruelling routine of rising at 4am and getting home at midnight after a gig became too much for her, and two months ago she stopped her cooking work. Now it’s only the jewellery income that supports the family. “It’s tough but I don’t want to give it up. It’s the first opportunity I’ve ever had to be someone.”

Given the profoundly subordinate status of maids in India, Mhatre could be forgiven for being worried about any possible repercussions, but she says firmly that “no madam can scare me”.

“My struggles in life have made me strong. Appearing on stage has added to my confidence now, so no, I don’t fear any repercussions. In fact, some madams who bumped into me near the lifts spoke politely to me for the first time. Before, I had been invisible.”","“Although my employers were mostly nice to me, I used to hear horror stories from other maids,” Deepika Mhatre, 43, told the Guardian.

140,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/uk-run-out-of-food-no-deal-brexit-national-farmers-union,"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,"UK could run out of food a year from now with no-deal Brexit, NFU warns","Britain would run out of food on this date next year if it cannot continue to easily import from the EU and elsewhere after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has warned.



Minette Batters, the NFU president, urged the government to put food security at the top of the political agenda after the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was talked up this week.

“The UK farming sector has the potential to be one of the most impacted sectors from a bad Brexit – a frictionless free trade deal with the EU and access to a reliable and competent workforce for farm businesses is critical to the future of the sector,” she said.

Batters’ warning comes a fortnight after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said Britain would have “adequate food supplies” after Brexit.

While Downing Street has insisted it is confident an agreement can be made in time, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, warned over the weekend that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was now at “60-40”, fuelling fears at the NFU and among food importers.

Food security in Britain is in long-term decline, with the country producing 60% of what it needs to feed itself, compared with 74% 30 years ago, according to figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).In a statement issued by the NFU, Batters expressed concern that Britain would not be able to meet its food needs if Brexit was mismanaged.

Research showed 7 August 2019 would be the nominal day that Britain would run out of food if it were asked to be wholly self-sufficient based on seasonal growth, the NFU said.

The calculation of the “notional date” by which time Britain would run out of food has been used as a measure of Britain’s food security for several years by experts concerned about the decline in home-grown food.

The temperatures of the past few weeks have put Britain’s food production capabilities into sharp focus and underlined concerns.

Batters said the consequences of there being no agreement could be mitigated if the government took immediate action and gave domestic production its “unwavering support”.

Changing eating habits over the past three decades have helped fuel the increasing reliance on food grown overseas, with perishable items such as tomatoes, lettuce and citrus fruits expected to be available all year round.

But global economics have also contributed to imbalances in foods that can be produced in the UK.

According to figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, the UK is a net exporter of meat, but relies heavily on imports such as bacon from Denmark, which exports 90% of its pork.

Defra statistics showed the next most vulnerable food category after fruit is fresh vegetables, with 57% of UK requirements produced in Britain, followed by pork at 61% and then potatoes, of which 25% are imported.

Britain exports more milk and cream products than it imports, and imports almost three times as much cheese as it exports, almost twice as many eggs and almost 20 times as many fresh vegetables, according to HMRC statistics for 2017.

Among the few surplus products are whisky and salmon.

The NFU said the figures showed Brexit is an opportunity for British food producers to redress the balance.

“The statistics show a concerning long-term decline in the UK’s self-sufficiency in food and there is a lot of potential for this to be reversed,” Batters said.

“And while we recognise the need for importing food which can only be produced in different climates, if we maximise on the food that we can produce well in the UK, then that will deliver a whole host of economic, social and environmental benefits to the country.”","Britain would run out of food on this date next year if it cannot continue to easily import from the EU and elsewhere after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has warned.
Minette Batters, the NFU president, urged the government to put food security at the top of the political agenda after the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was talked up this week.
Batters’ warning comes a fortnight after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said Britain would have “adequate food supplies” after Brexit.
The calculation of the “notional date” by which time Britain would run out of food has been used as a measure of Britain’s food security for several years by experts concerned about the decline in home-grown food.
The NFU said the figures showed Brexit is an opportunity for British food producers to redress the balance."

In an article picked up by Drudge Report and then tweeted by President Donald Trump himself, PJ Media editor Paula Bolyard makes the shocking claim that Google deliberately manipulates its search results to favor left-wing views and undermine the President.

In supporting this allegation, she goes to Google and looks through the first hundred listings on the search engine results page. Therein, she finds that 96 percent of results for ""Trump"" are from liberal media outlets. Bolyard remarks:

I was not prepared for the blatant prioritization of left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets. Looking at the first page of search results, I discovered that CNN was the big winner, scoring two of the first ten results. Other left-leaning sites that appeared on the first page were CBS, The Atlantic, CNBC, The New Yorker, Politico, Reuters, and USA Today

She adds that other than Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, traditional right-leaning outlets didn't make the cut:

PJ Media did not appear in the first 100 results, nor did National Review, The Weekly Standard, Breitbart, The Blaze, The Daily Wire, Hot Air, Townhall, Red State, or any other conservative-leaning sites except the two listed above.

Aha! A big tech company caught red handed pushing its progressive agenda. Well...not so fast. Rather than uncovering compelling evidence of bias, this article's author and its promoters merely reveal their ignorance of how search engines work.

First, the author seems to conflate Google Search and Google News, two products which use different algorithms and serve different functions. Google News is a searchable news aggregator and app (with some overt editorial functions), whereas Google Search tries to give users the most useful and relevant information in response to a query.

In order to determine what constitutes a relevant and useful result, search engines use complex algorithms to rank the quality of different pages based on a variety of signals such as keywords, authoritativeness, freshness or site architecture. A big part of this quality determination is based on outside links to a site – an idea going back to Larry Page and Sergey Brin's work at Stanford in the late 1990s that culminated in the creation of the PageRank algorithm.

Page and Brin realized that incoming links to a site served as a proxy for quality markers like authoritativeness, trustworthiness and popularity. Today, Google Search is much more complex, utilizing complex machine-learning functions like RankBrain and an evolving set of algorithms with names like Hummingbird, Panda, Penguin and Pigeon. However, incoming links are still a key factor. Additionally, while Google uses manual quality raters to test new algorithm changes, they do not use them on live search results.

Google News' approach to ranking results is also driven by algorithms that use a number of the same signals (you can get an idea from their patent), with a couple exceptions where manual input is used for editorial features, major events, and cross-over results from Google Search for particular topics.

With this in mind, it should be no great surprise that outlets like the New York Times, CNN, and Washington Post trounce outlets like PJ Media, National Review, and the Weekly Standard in organic search. The sites in the latter group don't have metrics that support them rising to the top of the search algorithm. Of course, PJ Media found Fox and WSJ weren't affected by this ""bias"" because their numbers are actually comparable to the former group of ""left-wing"" outlets (see below).

(Data from Alexa.com)

This approach to ranking quality isn't just a Google thing. If you look at competitors like DuckDuckGo or Bing (which PJ Media didn't seem to bother doing), you're going to see pretty similar results. Maybe this says something about the media landscape. But it's not a good reason to storm Mountain View with pitchforks.

PJ Media's conspiracy-mongering is based on an avoidable misunderstanding that could throw gasoline on the techlash and lead to policies that chill American innovation (although at least for now, conservatives still think a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet is a dumb idea).

It's worth saying that libertarians and conservatives aren't totally unreasonable in wanting to investigate whether they're getting fair treatment by tech companies. After all, Silicon Valley is a very liberal place that doesn't always reflect their norms or values (I also say this as someone with generally right-leaning views who has worked for organizations like the Cato Institute and R Street). That being said, if you're going to make an allegation that there's a big conspiracy, you should do your due diligence. This means taking time to understand the underlying technology before jumping to conclusions.

On Google's part, given all of the tensions around bias lately, they would probably be wise to be more transparent about how their news algorithm works and do more proactive outreach to avoid future misunderstandings.

During the interview, the leader praised relations between his country and China over the past 40 years. He declared also that the coming summit will further improve these relations.

Interview Transcript

CGTN : Your excellency, we thank you for giving us this interview. Lomé’s Gnassingbé Eyadema International Airport has been operational since two years now. How did this infrastructure affect the Togolese people? Also, has it helped boost trade between China and Togo?

Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé (F.E.G) : I will also thank you for this interview and would like to start off with a topic that the Togolese people are quite proud of our airport. First of all, I must praise all those engaged in its construction for the quality of their work. I believe it is a very nice airport, very efficient, safe in all ways that currently matter.

This airport also serves the region and you may notice, looking at neighboring nations, that it is probably one of the most modern in the region and it directly impacts the lives of the Togolese people. I can affirm that those who benefit most from the infrastructure are travelers and those working there. Did it help boost trade between China and our nation? Well, all I can say is that things are progressing greatly.

Trade between China and Togo keeps improving and this will continue. However, if what you are asking is to know if there will be a direct flight connecting both countries, I would say that in a few years, this will become a reality.

CGTN: Diplomatic ties between China and Togo are more than four decades old. What is your opinion regarding the development of the relationship between our two countries over the past few years and also how you foresee cooperation between us ?

F.E.G : Relations between China and Togo, like you said, are four decades old. Some things do not change. Our friendship is based on loyalty, mutual trust and understanding of major global issues. This has not changed.

What changed, and I would say it is for the best, is our economic relationship. It has become stronger.

Amounts involved are more significant and thus more tailored to our needs. As it gained power, China increased its financial support to African countries generally, and Togo specifically.

What I like most about our relations is that recently, they tend to focus more on exchange between youths. Many young Togolese have the opportunity to either go study in China or learn from the experiences your country has to offer.

CGTN : Which types of Chinese companies do you wish to attract to Togo ? Have investments made by Chinese firms helped Togo advance towards a sustainable development ?

F.E.G : Investments have helped Togo grow and advance in its development. However, you know that the path to growth has no end. There is no limitation to our progress, so far. We have achieved some progress, but more can be done. There are tens of millions of jobs about to be delocalized. So, any Chinese firm ready to delocalize is most welcome.

Regarding our preferred sectors for new investments, I would obviously say agriculture since it is the most important for our economy. Our agricultural sector needs to be modernized and industrialized, transformed into an agro-industry. I would say we need Chinese firms to invest in that sector.

As you may know, in Togo, and some other African nations, there are many young people and for those, the greatest concern is getting a job. We will do everything to create these jobs.

CGTN : In September, Beijing will host the China-Africa Cooperation Summit. You will be present and will meet China’s President Xi Jinping. What are your expectations for this meeting and what impact do you believe this forum will have on relations between China and Africa ?

F.E.G : I think this will be an important summit. As we look around, we can see how the world has changed. We see how the behavior of some powerful economies has changed. The world has become an unpredictable place.

As for China and Africa who are old allies and friends, we need to preserve stability. We also need to assess our perception of political and diplomatic developments actually taking place.

While some economic powers try to do things on their own, the foundation of the relationship between China and Africa lies in dialogue, focusing on a win-win cooperation. Both sides win.

I would like to discuss with President Xi Jinping about the various threats the world actually faces like terrorism and global warming. I know he, just like us, is concerned about those and would do everything to preserve peace everywhere it is threatened and most importantly promote multilateralism. That is it for political and diplomatic aspects.

In regards to economy, I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss a major project, which I praise, the “One Belt, One Road” project. We will discuss how Africa can contribute to this ambitious, generous, and revolutionary project. You know, it is quite rare to see a country, even a huge one such as China which is currently the world’s second leading economic power, launch such a major project that would involve almost every continent.

CGTN : The coming summit’s focus is the Belt and Road Initiative and this event aims to reinforce relations between China and Africa. How do you think the Belt and Road Initiative can improve China-Africa cooperation and what do you think of President Xi Jinping’s idea to build a Community of Common Destiny with Mankind ?

F.E.G : First I praise this idea to make the connection between the two. You see, looking at the world’s actual globalization, the main challenge is a rise above inequalities. Rich people are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. So with such inequalities, how can we talk about a Community of Common Destiny ? That is why, I laud the Belt and Road Initiative.

What matters is creating adequate conditions for the less fortunate so that they can aspire to wealth and get out of poverty which they live in daily. I also recently read President Xi Jinping’s book on ways to fight poverty so I find there, a common challenge we are facing.

If things continue as they are at the moment, there is no hope for a Community of Common Destiny.

However, building a community of common destiny should not be a mere slogan. Achieving this goal can only be done through action and the “One Belt, One Road” project is an action. So, I can make a connection between the President’s idea and the “Belt and Road Initiative”. Now, my wish, like I said earlier on, is for Africa to benefit and deserve whatever position it will be given in this major project.

Our first ambition is to ensure peace on the continent. With peace, we can move on to other things.","However, you know that the path to growth has no end.

143,https://theferret.scot/manilas-dead-front-line-philippines-drug-war/,"Wed, 01 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Ferret,No rest for Manila’s dead: the front line of the Philippines drug war,"The Philippines’ president Rodrigo Duterte was elected in 2016 on a platform of ridding the country of its drug addiction problem.

Under his instruction, thousands of suspected drug users and dealers have been killed by police, with many more live taken by vigilantes after he urged members of the public to kill those involved in drugs and criminality in the country. To date, an estimated 12,000 have lost their lives.

Journalist and filmmaker Anders Palm Olesen visited the capital city, Manila, in 2017, to speak to some of those affected by Duterte’s ruthless drug war.

The Caretakers

They shot him in the foot before he could run. He was pleading, begging for his life. People gathered, silent gazes. It was evident they had gotten the wrong man yet no one seemed to move. The killer looked down at Michael Siaron.

“Oh, you don’t want to run?”

His grave rests on the wall with all the others. Duterte Compound they call it. The first part of the grave complex is already full but the caretakers at Pasay City Cemetery are working hard to finish a new five-story high construction. When it’s ready, it will host another 200 graves.

Since Rodrigo Roa Duterte started his presidential term over two year ago, more than 12,000 people have been killed in Tokhang, the so-called war on drugs. The victims have been Manila’s poorest. In Pasay City Cemetery, the sweet rotten smell surges with the tropic afternoon rains.

“We wouldn’t go out at night. The houses were closed at seven o’clock. Then they would be ready to come in.”

Rex “Bibi” Guial, 33, lived all his life in the cemetery and works as a caretaker. In a charming wooden house resting on tall concrete graves, he lives with his wife, Mary Ann, and their youngest daughters. Every morning, they have breakfast on the porch overlooking the cemetery before Bibi gets up to feed the ducks and Mary Ann sends the girls off to school.

For Bibi and his family, Tokhang changed everything. “We wouldn’t go out at night. The houses were closed at seven o’clock. Then they would be ready to come in.”

By “they”, Bibi refers to police and vigilante death squads. The official and independent numbers defer on the actual death toll but roughly one third of the killings are done by police officers – the rest by vigilante groups. “If you are mistaken, there is nothing you can do”.

When Duterte first unleashed Tokhang, policemen would walk around the neighbourhood urging young men to sign a list confirming they were drug addicts and surrendering to a rehabilitation program. Oftentimes, the men wouldn’t know what kind of paper they were signing; either because they couldn’t read – or because the policeman would cover the text with a hand. Now, this list seems to be used to as a “master list”. If the officials have you on that list – you’re suspected drug addict. And then you have reason to fear for your life.

Twenty-four murdered in the drug war were buried in a mass grave.

The Mass Grave

“It is right here”, Bibi looks down on the patch of dirt beneath his feet, roughly the size of a garden porch. One of the cemetery’s main dirt paths runs right over. Looking closely, you realize it’s not small stones peeking out of the ground – but human bone. “It was a really deep hole.”

It’s not the only mass grave the caretakers have been digging recently – but it’s the biggest. Twenty-four bodies came in around Spring when the killings were at their peak.

The bodies were collected from the streets before taken to a funeral home – where some had been lying for two months without cooling. This is the fate of Tokhang’s poorest victims.

Many families in Manila’s slum can’t afford funeral costs and don’t collect the deceased. ‘Pauper’, they call them, the unidentified John Doe’s. Instead of a traditional burial, they end up in mass graves on an unmarked patch of dirt.

One of the caretakers and Bibi’s cousin, Edward “Wadwad” Guial, recalls that by the time the corpses came to the cemetery, they were already decomposing. While he and the other caretakers were paid by the number of heads buried, the smell of decay would linger in their clothes and nostrils for days.

A few weeks later, a family from the neighbourhood approached Wadwad. Their son had gone missing and they thought he might be among the 24. There was nothing to do but to reopen the grave; what met him was something that looked like “stew”.

“It was second to last, so we had to dig it again… I couldn’t bear it anymore.”

Down at the bottom of the grave, Wadwad found the remains of the family’s son.

Jun Santiago documents the night-time vigilante killings.

The Preacher

December 2016. Jun Santiago recalls the first time he went out on the night beat in the Manila Police District. It was late in the evening when they arrived at the crime scene.

A dark alley in Metro Manila only lit by flickering Christmas light. The smell of blood hung in the air with the silent fear of people around him. Everyone held their breath. Once the police left, the alley exhaled and echoed with cries over a lost neighbour, father, friend.

Jun Santiago is a Redemptorist Brother and activist. His church, the Redemptorist Church of Baclaran, became a sanctuary and shelter for the victims of the ongoing war on drugs. As an activist, he is part of the so called “night crawlers”, a group of photo-journalists working to document the night time killings in Manila.

Methamphetamine, or “shabu” as it is known locally, has been the main target of Duterte’s war on drugs.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, there are 1.8 million drug users in the Philippines out of which roughly half – or 0.9 per cent of the population – is accounted for by meth.

The meth users, according to Duterte, become a zombie-like dehumanized individual: “You must remember that those who are already (using) shabu for almost one year, they are dead. They are the living walking dead… They are of no use to society anymore.”

But the problem of methamphetamine isn’t unique to the Philippines and the numbers even start to look small when compared to Australia where meth use amounts to 1.4 per cent of the population.

""The law is no longer concerned about the people. The law is on the side of the corrupt police"". Jun Santiago

To Jun Santiago, Tokhang reflects a larger delusion prevalent in the population at large: “many may say that it’s okay for them to die, they [the drug users] are the plagues, they are the rapists, they are the ones who rape babies.” But what he sees happening is a sort of witch hunt; the victims are the poor, the unemployed, the uneducated – mainly from Manila’s urban poor areas.

“It’s scary,” he says, “the law is no longer concerned about the people. The law is on the side of the corrupt police – the ones who were supposed to protect us.”

The population at large has continued to show support for Duterte’s presidency albeit a recent decline in urban areas.

Jun Santiago hopes the Philippines will open their eyes to the atrocities done before them: “The cure is not eliminating the users or the pushers. Too many people have died in the past year without addressing the issue of poverty or corruption.”

President Duterte meets Russian leader Vladimir Putin

The Vigil

The brutal reality for Manila’s poorest is that there is no way of knowing when the killings will end. So far it has lasted for more than two years, and was ‘re-launched’ in February.

The latest Human Rights Watch estimate of those who have lost their lives in the purge is 12,000 killings, while an opposition senator in the country claims 20,000 are dead.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) launched a crimes against humanity inquiry against Duterte in February. In response, he gave notice that The Phillipines would withdraw from the body.

But why is this happening? What sort of incentive would encourage a continued slaughter of his own people? Part of the answer could be that Duterte is so wrapped up in his own narrative that he is no longer capable of untangling himself.

During the election, he hired Nic Gabunada, a marketing consultant, and gave him a budget of $200.000 to assemble a network of internet trolls. He consistently portrayed himself as a no-bullshit patriarch with the muscle and backbone to “do the dirty job”.

Roberto Duterte cited the Holocaust and claimed he would be happy to slaughter 3 million drug addicts.

Once and for all, he would clean the streets of Manila from crime and corruption. Only then would the Philippines become a prosperous nation.

Echoing Vladimir Putin’s Russia, this has since expanded to a “keyboard army” with thousands of supporters working day-in day-out to amplify Duterte’s narratives and silence opponents.

Control over media and the political narrative means power: The fabrication of fake news in a poorly educated democracy like the Philippines, even more so. Increasingly, it seems like a Pandora’s Box has been opened – and it’s unlikely Duterte will be able to dig out of the authoritarian trenches he summoned around himself.

All the above is a faint whisper to Bibi and the caretakers working at the cemetery. Their future is bound to the earth beneath their feet: “The holes are filled right away… Who is next? It will not leave our minds when building the graves; we can be the ones to end up here.”

Bibi sees no immediate way out of the ghastly void: “We won’t find peace until Duterte’s term ends. That’s it”.

One source close to the Manafort team told Fox News, “We’re in the game.”

Before court was adjourned in the afternoon, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III announced that jurors would continue their work on Friday morning.

Ellis read aloud a note detailing four questions from the jury, which covered foreign financial accounts, shell companies, the definition of reasonable doubt and other evidence in the case.

Outside court on Thursday, Manafort’s defense attorney, Kevin Downing, called the questions from the jury -- especially the one about reasonable doubt -- a “good sign.”

“So, overall a very good day for Mr. Manafort,” Downing told reporters.

After a trial spanning nearly three weeks, Manafort, 69, is awaiting a verdict on tax evasion and bank fraud charges. He has been accused of hiding income earned from his Ukrainian political work from the IRS. He’s also accused of fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

A humorous moment occurred earlier Thursday after Ellis excused the jury from the courtroom.

“Mr. Trump, are you here?” the judge asked, eliciting an audible gasp from the many reporters in the room.

It turned out the judge was referring to a man named Jim Trump, a prosecutor who was present in court for the next case and has no relation to President Trump. The moment resulted in a smile and a laugh from Manafort.

Before deliberations started, Ellis acknowledged that the jury room is small. He offered to let the jurors use his conference room to deliberate instead. The jury, though, informed the judge that the members would prefer to deliberate in the break room, where they eat lunch. Ellis granted the request.

PROSECUTORS BLAST ‘MANAFORT’S LIES’ IN CLOSING

A unanimous verdict from the 12 jurors is required to convict Manafort on each of the 18 counts against him.

During closing arguments on Wednesday, attorneys for Manafort suggested that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team had improperly ensnared their client in his ongoing probe of alleged Russian influence in U.S. politics.

Manafort attorney Richard Westling told jurors that banks had not reported any problems with Manafort to regulators ""until the special counsel came and asked questions,"" and he accused prosecutors of ""stacking"" charges against Manafort. And Downing, the other defense attorney, said several times the prosecution should have been handled by an IRS audit, rather than through a high-profile federal prosecution by the special counsel's office.

Prosecutors said both arguments violated a pretrial agreement not to discuss the larger political context of the case. Later in the day, during jury instructions that lasted well over an hour, Ellis told jurors to ignore the defense team's suggestion that the Mueller prosecution was politically motivated.

Throughout their closing arguments during the day, defense attorneys claimed prosecutors had produced ""not a single bit"" of evidence in support of their charges.

On Wednesday, prosecutors used their closing arguments to paint the former Trump campaign chairman as a chronic liar, telling jurors Manafort is “not above the law.”

The prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner, who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

Manafort’s legal troubles won’t end with this trial. He is also facing charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including allegations of conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

Last week, some of the last child soldiers to escape from the dreadful Lord’s Resistance Army arrived in Gulu in northern Uganda, saying that the roaming rebel leader Joseph Kony now has a total of less than 100 soldiers.

In practical terms, the LRA, which was ejected from Uganda a decade ago and went marauding in Central Africa, is a finished force. This brings to an end a generation of destruction that retarded the development of most of northern Uganda for decades.

But would that lost generation have been enough to develop the area? Examples abound around the world.

The United Arab Emirates grew from a hopeless tract of desert in the early 1970s to a top shopping and holiday destination. South Korea rose from a hopeless place in the early ‘70s to the world's ninth-largest economy.

The other Asian Tigers also did it in one generation. Vietnam started later, emerging from the most brutal manifestation of the Cold War in 1986. A generation later, look where they are.

Incidentally, Uganda too emerged from its wars to a new era in 1986. But being a complex society without homogeneity among its 50 or so ethnic communities, mobilising Ugandans for development, it seems, is very difficult. (I need some excuse for our inexplicable retardation amid abundant natural and human resources.)

In which case, let us examine two geographical, ethnically homogeneous communities – Acholi and Buganda – that have obviously lost a generation.

A generation generally is the period from the birth of parents to the birth of their children, roughly thirty years. From 1986 when Uganda's ""northern-dominated"" armies were defeated, suppose the Acholi community had immersed themselves in hard work instead of rebellion and sending their educated folk to North American exile, would they be a South Korea today?

What about Buganda, whose people sighed with relief in 1986 when their ""oppressors"" were kicked out, and had their kingship restored in 1993?

On July 31, Baganda marked the silver jubilee of the restoration of the Kabaka. Without the conflict and disturbance that bedevilled Acholi, why hasn’t Buganda utilised the peaceful generation to transform economically?

Like all other Ugandan communities, neither Buganda nor Acholi has overcome poverty in the past 30 years; their youth are scampering to sell whatever they have and even what isn’t theirs to go and slave abroad in pitiful conditions. The older people remaining behind are busy inventing excuses for their societies remaining hopelessly poor.

In southwestern Uganda, they have a saying that a man who fails to make his wife pregnant blames their sleeping mat. The Acholi blame Kony’s conflict. Buganda blame Museveni’s peace (that since 1986, it makes them oversleep and not work).

It is the end of a generation, and time lost cannot be recovered. Ugandans born in 1986 are now 33, the age at which men generally start ageing. Those who were 33 in 1986 are now 65 and if they served in civil service, must have by law have retired a decade ago.

If half of the people aged from 33 to 65 do not have the basics such as access to health care through insurance or enough savings, then that generation has not only ended but also been lost. Let us come up with some more excuses…

Without the conflict and disturbance that bedevilled Acholi, why hasn’t Buganda utilised the peaceful generation to transform economically?"

The article talks about how youth from Padanna in Kerala have been working on the ground in flood-hit areas, ferrying supplies. The reason this village is talked about is that the village has earned the monicker ‘ISIS recruitment hub’ after the intelligence officials have busted ISIS network in Kerala multiple times in recent years.

Muslims make up 27 per cent of Kerala’s population. Padanna first came to light in May 2016 after over 25 people from Kerala fled to Afghanistan to join the ISIS. Most of those who have joined the ranks in the ISIS are reportedly educated professionals hailing from middle class or upper-middle-class families, thereby the argument that lack of education and poverty is driving the youth to extremism falls flat.

The Indian Express article describes in great detail how nearly 100 youngsters from Padanna, which is a Muslim-majority village, are playing a major role in helping Kerala recover from the floods. The report says that the youth have trimmed their beard and are avoiding ‘obvious symbols’ to avoid ‘unwanted attention’. The author names many Muslims from Padanna who are helping Kerala out in this hour of need. While the relief and rescue efforts are indeed commendable, it still can’t obfuscate the fact that many Muslim youths from that village are joining ISIS.

The good deeds of these many men do not take away the fact that there is a law and order situation in Kerala that needs to be addressed. We have earlier written about the silence around the fact that ISIS is taking roots in India, especially Kerala.

In 2014, the security agencies arrested 6 people for pro-ISIS sentiments and engaging in behaviour supportive of the Jihadist terror group. In 2015, that number rose to 19. Again in 2016, the numbers saw a rise and 54 people were arrested for pro-ISIS sentiments. In 2017, however, the number came down to 34.

However, these are just numbers of those arrested. The actual number of those who have joined the terror group is pegged to be much higher. As many as 88 Indians, the majority being from Kerala are believed to have joined ISIS. Shockingly, the political parties seem either in denial or are hesitant to effectively deal with extremist groups.

ISIS has been trying to gain a foothold in India in last few years, with reports emerging of the blueprint of turning Kashmir into an Islamic Caliphate. ISIS sympathizers and terrorists have been arrested from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh as well.

When Indian Express uses the goodwill of law-abiding Muslim youths to whitewash the sins of the ones who have joined ISIS, or to obfuscate a national security issue of a village turning into an ISIS recruitment hub, it does no favours to the nation as well as the many Muslim youths who have nothing to do with ISIS and perhaps detest the phenomenon of Islamic extremism as much as the next person. In an attempt to apologise for Islamic extremism and soften the blow of the glaring national security issue of ISIS looming large, Indian Express does a massive disservice to those Muslims who, inadvertently, are being painted with the same brush as those who join the ranks of terrorists.

One wonders why Indian Media, which is an extension of Indian “liberals” choose to whitewash terrorism and fundamentalism in order to project themselves as the messiahs of Indian Muslims. We have seen how self-proclaimed “liberals” often turn out to be terror sympathisers, and hence, it is only natural that media would follow suit. However, it is always an astounding low when law-abiding Muslims are used for their terror apology.

Writing about horror stories of Muslim youths joining the ranks of ISIS with a human touch of innocent Muslims helping flood victims only helps to obfuscate a real issue, a serious one, that stares the nation and threatens to destabilise the country.

While it is indeed unfair to paint the entire community as terrorists just because of deeds of a few, it is also equally unfair to use the innocent Muslims as a plank to whitewash the sins of those who join the ISIS.","The Indian Express today published an article titled ‘Kerala floods: Village battling Islamic State tag is part of relief team’.

The political class which kidnapped our tomorrow for a ransom, now wants to buy our today as well. Going by the torment of the past decade, the reality is that the political class sees ours and the nation’s future as a game on the field, of which they constitute the players, while the rest of us are nothing but spectators.

Their perception is completely different from ours in a game that is essentially a combo of amorality and mediocrity layered on a thick spread of narcisstic insecurity.

This explains the repugnant insolent and pernicious display of arrogance on Sunday, by Ernest ‘Ali Baba’ Koroma and his APC, who seem to be suffering from hubris syndrome – a disorder of the possession of power, particularly power which has been held for years with minimal constraint on the possessor of the said power.

The lack of personal integrity by this bunch of puny and Lilliputian opposition characters , trying to hoodwink the nation into believing that they were never engaged in the ‘feast of vultures’ that left the nation prostrated, is not only infantile, but an escape into the realm of illusion.

It is a hollow chest-beating exercise to obliterate the painful reality of their worst nightmare of losing power.

This fiendish lot who left their subjects bleeding and weeping in sorrow and abject penury, insulted our collective sensibility by showing us that they have no remorse for their sins and the state in which they left our beloved country.

The show of strength becomes more incorrigible when you realise that the same party and personnel who are crying ‘witch hunt, tribalism, etc, as the date with nemesis approach and during whose tenure, such an arrogant display of fillip was a taboo, find it expedient to attempt to tell the rest of us that they are still a force to be reckoned with. Fair enough.

Except for the jobless youths recruited to give a semblance of respectability to the choreographed stunt (we saw same during campaign and what good did that do for them?), I’m sure most Sierra Leoneans are not that gullible to forget the fact that elections are not for another five years.

Koroma and his ilk should let it trickle down to their medulla that things are no longer the same. It is no more business as usual and there is nothing they can do about it.

If Sierra Leone is to have more than a fleeting chance of escaping the quagmire into which the decade-long APC misrule has taken us, we cannot allow these regressive elements to deploy their cunning tricks to deter us from the task of making our society an accountable one, through a gradual convergence towards the truth ultimately.

We have a people problem at all ends of the spectrum, but especially at the leadership ends. It is painful to watch otherwise intelligent people compromise and attempt to justify this lunacy.

It is also unfortunate that Ernest Koroma’s old and new fans nudging him to continue to display insensate arrogance, don’t have an idea about the dilemma and quandary, him and his acolytes are facing.

Payback they say, can be a Bitch, especially when you think you would never have to pay back.

So welcome to the sunset boulevard, in our journey for a new Sierra Leone. Sit back and watch the X-rated class C movie coming to a cinema near you, as we pierce through the artifice of the corruption flumes which is giving an indication that it will exit in a miasma, whose configuration we are not quite sure of yet.

But don’t worry, we’ll have a much clearer picture of where this is all going soon. Everyone will then have to reach for their heavy weaponry and it will be a NO HOLDS BARRED contest. Just make sure that you book your ticket for this blockbuster of a movie that promises to be vicious and ugly.

The evolution of the government’s fight against the acrid stench of the malodorous corruption fart of the last administration, has opened a new play in which the other side, which deliberately made the enlargement of the poverty-league a state policy and which was notorious for foistering a culture in which anything goes, scurrying for the canopy of tribalism, victimisation, witch-hunt etc.

Rather than regret or recollect the time when they were serving the innocent and the vulnerable, a changeless diet of looting and explain how our commonwealth was spent; or how they acquired their choice properties all over the world and boosted their bank balances to obese proportion, those going under scrutiny and their acolytes are whipping up provocative political, ethnic and religious sentiments.

In the ferocity of their pathological refutal and as they resort/ed to the usual abuses, religious and tribal tirade, they forgot that those for whom poverty was the currency of the day during their profligate reign, could decipher that it is corruption simply fighting back.

That, no matter what they spew and how much they try to protect the abominable and despise the truth, Lady Justice is usually blindfolded for a reason and the putrid worrisome chaos of their din and the power of disinformation, especially through social media, though scary at times, is simply first class delusion.

It is the collective desire of the people of Sierra Leone not only to see things done differently, but to have an insight into the macabre dance of the last leadership cadre, with whom they had to eat with a long spoon.

In this regard I’m not sure that the emasculated and emaciated silent majority will allow the bad but vocal voices, to damage our collective, unchallenged again.

There is no doubt that the looting spree of the last administration is a grotesque insult to the people and the sordid recklessness, again shines a pitiless light on the culture of avariciousness in the corridors of power where greedy politicians treated the public like nincompoops.

The hideous action did not come out of a vacuum though and vital questions scream to be asked, if such an atrocity is to be prevented and our societal morals to no longer stay entirely elastic.

I am aware that when the Koroma regime was changing and chopping ‘contractors’ for our ‘commonwealth’, some of the same people crying crucify them today, clapped and cheered them on then.

When they told us we’d never had it so good and should be grateful for the cosmetics they provided, some went bonkers, slapping them with the ‘world best’ appellation.

While the Kleptomaniacs of the past government were popping up all over the landscape, putting up mansions that an honest worker could only dream of, people smarted back in amazement and fell down in gratitude for the crumbs that fell from their tables.

We went into voluntary hypnosis as that inept and gluttonous bunch of narcissistic Draculas created distortions that destroyed our society and fuelled widespread poverty, unemployment and social discontent.

Even though the scars from their unkindest cut were deep, we wallowed in a subjugation that had been embedded in our psyche, forgetting that even the maddest of madmen enjoys a flash of lucidity once in a yellow sun. But then the self-delusion of a once progressive society was not only comforting, it was virtually complete, until the arrival of a new sheriff in town. No cycle runs forever.

The question is: Has the new administration learnt from the horrible mistakes, deceit and outright criminality of our governance in the past, especially when it comes to change?

Is the proposed commission of inquiry a sleigh of the hand by a punctiliously polite brigade commander, revelling in the confident eccentricity that makes the poor go weak at the knees, when he turns up at the fancy dress party?

Judging by the penchant of the executive to convoluted governance and the portrayal of the centre as a fiefdom, emitting signs of operating under the morally despicable parameters of the past, which has elicited mistrust and doubts, how much optimism and confidence will the generality of the people be given, that this time there will be no truism in the adage that ‘a mosquito that sucks blood from the testicles, receives the softest slap’?

With the vuvuzela accompanying every move of the battle against corruption, as well as the actions of the ACC, the insidious culture of purportedly ‘independent’ institutions helping to play out perceived agenda is one of the reasons that an otherwise cleansing exercise becomes nothing but a first-class delusion in actually serving its purpose fully.

Past exercises have incessantly demonstrated a predilection of partiality to those that picked them and even though the inquiry is to be headed by a Nigerian judge said to have been chosen by the British government, reports that compromise deals whereby some of those who had their hands in the till are plea-bargaining, is already being seen by some, (and rightly too), as part of a game of sound and fury from a synthetic and utterly unedifying politics.

It will be fascinating as we go on, to see how the government copes with the distant thunder of ethnicity, the roars of sinister political payback as well as screams of betrayal, in an atmosphere where it is seen as simply spending big, talking big and acting big, so that the fete could look good.

Sierra Leone politics has and is a cesspool of perfidy. It often promotes nepotism way above the giddy sky-highness of impunity and creates an atmosphere that enables the heaviness of coercive force, to franchise mal/ misadministration, after an initial inflation of the balloon of hope.

This is not going on a condemnation lane or playing devil’s advocate. The challenge as I see it, is that amidst the euphoria, the government seems to have failed to realise that it is in a bear-pit and it has to stand up to that; or else, the seismic shift to the new direction, which taps into the greater truth of the sub-conscious, will become a shaming manifestation of political double speak.

A population down in the dumps amidst the increasing cost of living, insecurity and pulverisation of the immediate past, can only feast on the drink of showmanship for a while. It might have become inured to the vacuous egoistic political ranting and displays, which is an axiom, that the political class does nothing but pull the wool over the eyes of the citizens.

They can only buy into the promised social and welfare promises of the new direction including the proposed inquiry, when every move of the government is devoid of the repetition of the catalogues of intrigues, impunity, double-standard, kleptocracy and cancer of circus, of the past.

It is not the amount of hours of propaganda and sensationalism accompanying every move of the stage actors that really gels with the people. Instead of the constant illusion of hope of the past four months, our leaders need to ensure that while no system is perfect, their task is to ensure that in improving the imperfections that have held us back for so long, the people are first made to appreciate that the New Direction’s own cure, will not be worse than the diseases of the immediate past, for which they claim to have an antidote.

Quite a number of people are not sure of the fanfares and gleeful handling of governance. The jury seems to be still out even in these early days of the administration. Some wonder whether it is the sound of the wagon’s gear in reverse, especially since there is a belief that politicians do not fight each other as part of the unwritten rules of their game.

Similarly, the wheels of the new administration had barely begun to turn when the vehicle hit a major gulley in its attempt to raise national interest and context above the rickety train of fraud, mediocrity, non-charlance and collective hypocrisy as well as nepotism and tribalism, with the shenanigans of the ruling party in parliament, the reckless display and Déjà Vu of the police force, as well as some power paradox from the executive.

The mass hypnotism that accompanied the new administration is also gradually giving way to social, political and economic realities.

And as agents of the government turn the law on its head and deploy state instruments of coercion to achieve illegal ends in parliament and on the streets against opponents, the stark truth that we are only a pun in the political chess game becomes more vivid.

This is a multifaceted conversation which can only be enriched by a multiplicity of views on how not to sell our future for the greed of those who were in charge of our past as well as our present.

All the time, the clock is ticking; the arithmetic of governance is working against the pantomime on display in the society but the people still find safety in the total fog of disbelief of the political class, having taken so many bullets to the heart.

A new Sierra Leone is not a wish or preference or even a debating position, it is an endpoint, just like in titration.

The intellectual convergence is already happening never mind the looters and their supporters’ ostrich noise, even as the indignation towards the apology of the past hurtles towards a critical mass for effective change to take place. It is rising by the day.

The specific how, is beyond any person’s prediction ability. The individual components cannot direct the system. The system, just like a crowd, has its own dynamics. Not a very satisfying answer, but anyone who claims the ability to predict the specific point and nature, does not understand complex adaptive systems of individually-acting agents.

We have a golden opportunity once again to seize our politics which is like a mad riddle, by the scruff of the neck in this era , which demands that political ideas must be draped over distinctive personality to cut through the Babel of parochial noise.

The promised new direction and our hunger for something different, after the frenzy of political malice against the people of Sierra Leone by the last administration, has acted as a maypole of sorts around which the less pragmatic of us are dancing manically.

For now, what a serious drama going on in our governance. Welcome to Act 1 Scene 1. seat back and watch the c-class movie that confirms that making a distinction on political governance based on parties is at best mental masturbation, at worst intellectual self-gratification..

The authors note that ensuring that no one will be left behind entails “taking explicit action to end extreme poverty, curb inequalities, confront discrimination,” as well as fast-tracking progress for those who are most marginalized.

The UNDP paper titled, ‘What Does It Mean to Leave No One Behind?,’ aims to stimulate dialogue and help generate consensus on delivering the leave no one behind agenda. The authors distinguish absolute deprivation from relative disadvantage, but note that both hinder peoples’ choices and capabilities to participate in or benefit from human development. The paper asserts that the disadvantages people face can be understood through a framework of five factors:

the discrimination they face;

where they live (geography);

socio-economic status;

how they are governed; and

vulnerability to shocks.

The paper also highlights the importance of intersectionality, as multiple factors often lead to a combination of disadvantages. Given the complex, multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the paper makes the case for a “holistic response” that “considers the severity and overlaps between different types of deprivation.” The authors also assert that all countries – even while data sets may be incomplete – have “some degree of evidence” of each of the five types of disadvantages.

By looking at these factors and three “mutually reinforcing levers,” the paper outlines how UNDP can support countries to: examine why people are left behind; empower those people; and enact change through policies, reforms and other interventions. Given the urgency of SDG achievement and leaving no one behind, the authors call for acting simultaneously on all three levers of change.

Within these workstreams, UNDP is undertaking assessments to gather evidence and strengthen national capacities, expanding opportunities for civil society, and building local governance systems that reduce inequality and exclusion. The framework is intended to inform both UN Country Teams’ public-facing work and that of national partners, as well as “the manner in which UNDP designs, implements, monitors and evaluates” projects.

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner previewed some of the framework’s learnings during a side event at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including the notion that “averages hide a lot of very brutal truth.” Convened by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the event reviewed 86 countries’ readiness to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda. Steiner also underscored that “we are not starting from zero,” as the development community has years of understanding on the issue, which has informed related UNDP initiatives such as the agency’s Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) work, which supports partner countries in their efforts to implement the SDGs.

The HLPF also featured a set of eight Voluntary National Review (VNR) Labs convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), with Lab 2 focusing on leaving no one behind. Feeding into the Labs, the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) released publications related to the concept of leave no one behind.

Failure to take action now means that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be met, undermining the credibility of the international community and leaving millions to die unnecessarily.

The report, SDG Progress: Fragility, Crisis and Leaving No One Behind, examines country-level progress against the SDGs and makes projections as to how much more effort will be needed to reach them by 2030. The findings come one year before the first heads of state level SDG Summit to track progress on the global goals will take place.

Despite the 2015 commitment by governments to ‘leave no behind’ as part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda, unless significant progress is made in reaching the poorest and most marginalized people, including those refugees, internally displaced people, and people living in conflict zones, the SDGs will not be met.

The report concludes by laying out five recommendations to ensure people in crisis and other marginalized groups are prioritized in SDG implementation. Recommendations include the establishment of a high-level panel of global leaders to catalyze international action over the next 12 months, and a formalized process for tracking progress at country-level.

Behind all of these numbers is the harsh reality of disrupted lives. Families without hope or a home, children out of school, young people with no jobs and poor health, struggling to survive and living in conflict or in a new country that are often already grappling with its own poverty and lack of opportunities.

For world leaders gathering this week at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), climate change is a critical issue. Yet away from the noise of New York, on Mongolia’s wind-swept steppe, it is already an existential threat.

Mongolia is one of the countries most vulnerable to global warming. In the last 70 years, its temperatures have climbed three times faster than the world’s average, rising more than 2 degrees centigrade and surpassing the global threshold.

This week, a new film highlighting Mongolia’s climate plight will screen at the UNGA. Produced by Raw Cinematics and supported by UNDP Mongolia, Blue Gold examines the effects of global warming in the Land of the Eternal Blue Sky, where glaciers are melting away, shrinking by 40 percent since the 1990s. For nomadic herders downstream, their road to disappearance spells disaster; glaciers are reservoirs providing safe drinking water – blue gold – during Mongolia’s scorching summers.

On the eve of the Global Climate Action Summit two weeks ago, UN Secretary-General António Guterres sounded the alarm on climate change and called for urgent action. While more than 100 countries have ratified the Paris climate agreement, representing 77 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, he noted: “What is missing is leadership, a sense of urgency and a true commitment to a decisive, multilateral response.”

In Mongolia, climate change is moving faster than we are. Both its summers and winters are growing harsher. In 2017, we saw the hottest summer in half century, with two thirds of the country stricken by drought, while desertification has already turned a quarter of its land to desert, according to official data. Without enough grass, animals lack the fodder to survive the world’s coldest winter, when temperatures plunge below minus 40 degrees centigrade.

As a result, nomadic herders – now about a third of Mongolia’s population – whose livelihoods depend on their animals, are finding their centuries-old way life at risk. With the ecosystems their livelihoods depend on eroding, a growing number are migrating to cities. Today, half the country’s population lives in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, where many struggle to find work and live in tented gers, without sanitation, running water or central heating.

In the freezing winter, many in ger districts burn coal, the cheapest way to keep warm. This contributes to 80 percent of Ulaanbaatar’s winter emissions, giving it the some of the worst air pollution on earth, exceeding 60 times the World Health Organization’s safe limit in one district during the week of 18-24 December 2017, according to Mongolia Meteorological Agency (NAMEM).

Blue Gold documents the impacts of climate change on Mongolia's mountain glaciers. The film is being launched during the 2018 UN General Assembly.



Mongolia cannot afford climate-induced poverty or pollution. Already, it is grappling with a sharp rise in poverty, jumping 40 percent between 2014 and 2016 during an economic crisis. In 2016, Mongolia ranked equally wtih China on the Human Development Index (HDI) - 90th of 189 countries. By 2018, it slipped to 92nd place, while China jumped to 86th. At a precarious time in its economic recovery, climate change threatens to reverse Mongolia’s development further.

To address these challenges, Mongolia has committed to cutting emissions by 14 percent and ramping up renewables, such as solar and wind, by 2030. These mitigation measures are included in Mongolia’s Sustainable Development Vision 2030, bringing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the national context. Together with the Global Environment Facility, UNDP is working with the Government of Mongolia to introduce new building codes, construction technologies and designs for energy efficient buildings.

Adapting to a changing climate is also crucial. In an effort to better manage water amid scarcity, we are also carrying out an Ecosystem Based Adaptation (EBA) project supported by the Adaptation Fund, to help herding communities use their water resources sustainably.

While local actions like these are important, a global problem calls for global solutions. Large countries especially must cut emissions further and support small nations like Mongolia financially as they adapt.

The SDGs represent a promise: to leave no one behind. That promise can only be kept by fighting climate change as a united community, from cities to steppes.

A picture (or in this case, a film) is worth a thousand words. So we’re heading to the UNGA to show world leaders what is at stake for Mongolia.

“Chad is surrounded by hotbeds of conflict and crises, in a region characterized by the spread of terrorism, illicit trafficking of all kinds, including trafficking in human beings related to illegal immigration, transnational organized crime, the drought and the advance of the desert.”

Recalling the collective commitment of the Lake Chad Basin countries that has resulted in progress against the Boko Haram terrorist group, Minister Cherif underscored that peace and security is essential for long-term development.

In that context, he reiterated a call by the Group of Five for the Sahel (the G-5 Sahel) joint force requesting the Security Council to place its mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, concerning threats to international peace.

In his address, the Minister informed the UN Assembly of socio-economic development efforts in his country, noting that Chad has prioritize partnerships based on results in improving conditions on the ground.

The Government will take steps centred on building resilience through sustainable development, he said, adding despite challenges, Chad has adopted a national development plan to that end.

He also highlighted the central role of women in development processes, and said that his Government has introduced a new law, establishing a 30 per cent quota for females in the civil service and in elected positions.

He also said that a viable mechanism to manage migration must address its underlying causes, including poverty, under-development, conflict, climate change and population pressures, and called on all countries to ensure the protection of migrant rights.

In closing, he emphasized the need for Security Council reform, underlining an urgent need to allocate a permanent seat representing Africa.

“Like it or not […] Africa in the twenty-first century is indispensable and its voice must be heard,” he said.

27 September 2018, New York - Gender gaps in agriculture in Africa are holding back progress towards ending hunger and must be urgently addressed, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Director-General José Graziano da Silva said at a joint event with the African Union (AU) on the margins of the UN General Assembly.

""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition. For that, we must close persisting gender gaps in agriculture in Africa,"" Graziano da Silva said.

The Director-General called for better representation of women in governance mechanisms and decision-making processes, as well as adequate and equal access to land, financial resources, social protection programmes, services and opportunities for women in rural areas.

Addressing gender gaps

The findings and recommendations of the AU-FAO study The Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems were presented at the event. The Outlook is based on an extensive review of existing statistics, gender audits of 38 National Agricultural Investment Plans and in-depth country gender assessments carried out in 40 countries.

The study's recommendations call for a ""gender data revolution"" in the agri-food sector to inform sound policies and programmes, and elevating the gender benchmarks in planning, monitoring and accountability.

""We need to put in place gender targeted programmes that address women's specific vulnerabilities but also their key role in household nutrition and resilience,"" Graziano da Silva said.

""Evidence shows that when women are empowered, farms are more productive, natural resources are better managed, nutrition is improved, and livelihoods are more secure,"" he added.

The backbone of rural production

In some African countries, women account for up to 60 percent of the labour force in family farming. They are largely responsible for agricultural activities such as growing vegetables, preserving harvests and raising small ruminants such as sheep and goats. Women are also responsible for family nutrition through the preparation of meals.

Closing productivity gaps could increase food production and consumption by up to 10 percent and reduce poverty by up to 13 percent.

If women have the same access to skills, resources and opportunities as men, they can be powerful drivers in the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Empowering women in agriculture, value chains and trade will accelerate the achievement of the Malabo Commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals.

FAO and UN Women: building momentum on gender equality

On the sidelines of the event, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo met with UN Women's Deputy Executive Director Asa Regner.

UN Women recently commended FAO for its achievements so far in gender equality. In 2017, FAO met or exceeded 93 percent of all performance indicators under the UN System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

""FAO recognizes the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment - both within the Organization and in our work where gender is a major priority. We know that when women have decision-making power, all of society benefits,"" Semedo said.

""The partnership between UN Women and FAO has proven especially fruitful in turning words into concrete action. I look forward to continued, strengthened cooperation between the two agencies to unlock the potential of rural women and girls as agents of change,"" Regner said.

Equality in action

FAO and partners are providing technical support to many African countries in order to empower rural women. One example is the Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Women in Ethiopia, Liberia, Niger and Rwanda, implemented with the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and UN Women. The Programme has already enabled more than 40,000 women to receive training on improved agricultural technologies, and aims to enhance their access to financial services and markets.","""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition.

Speech Shows Trump Thinks He’s the Boss of Everyone,"Diplomats and heads of state from all over the world laughed at President Donald Trump’s boast that he has “accomplished more than any administration in the history of our country.” At the podium of the United Nations General Assembly, Trump took it on the nose—“Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK”—and then sleepily delivered a bellicose, 35-minute presentation of international cooperation as a threat to America.

Last year, Trump gave a #MAGA rally-caliber speech defending “sovereignty” that echoed one of Vladimir Putin’s General Assembly addresses. This time, Russia received a single throwaway reference, but otherwise, Trump intensified the sovereignty theme on Tuesday morning, as promised by his senior officials, contrasting “independence” with “global governance, control and domination.”

Much as Trump has equated immigration with an invasion, now multilateral institutions are coming for the sovereignty that Trump portrayed as the wellspring of human achievement.

At the heart of Trump’s speech, and his vision of global affairs more broadly, was a politics of dominance, one that expresses its agenda by locating it in its enemies. Don’t tell America what to do, Trump said, because every nation has a “right to pursue its own customs, beliefs and traditions. The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship.”

“ Everywhere Trump looked, he saw global avarice encircling to choke the life out of America. ”

That comes as news to the vast majority of the world over the past century, which has grown accustomed—though not acquiescent—to the U.S. throwing its massive power and influence around, often violently. That’s particularly true in what Trump has referred to as “shithole” countries. At one point, when Trump attacked socialism’s “oppression,” the United Nations’ webfeed camera showed two Swedish diplomats cocking their heads in amused bewilderment.

Trump’s message was hardly one of leaving the world to its own peaceful devices. It was one where Trump sets the conditions for the world to follow, cloaked in revisionist history. Global free trade, for decades pushed on developing economies by the U.S. and yielding substantial wealth transfer upwards, was portrayed as a mechanism for other countries to “rig the system in their favor.” In between praising the Trump-coaxing regime of Saudi Arabia, Trump attacked OPEC as “ripping off the rest of the world” before demanding protection money: “We want them to start lowering [oil] prices, and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on.” U.S. efusal to participate in the 2016 Global Compact on Migration, an entirely voluntary framework, was premised on preventing an “international body unaccountable to our own citizens.”

Everywhere Trump looked, he saw global avarice encircling to choke the life out of America–an America he defined in the blood-and-soil terms of “a culture built on strong families, deep faith, and strong independence,” rather than the mixture of cultures that form the United States.

“ Vocal support for Trump himself will become a factor in honoring historic American commitments to the world. ”

Financial and military aid, from now on, will receive a “hard look” and go to “to those who respect us and our friends,” suggesting that vocal support for Trump himself will become a factor in honoring historic American commitments to the world.

In Trump’s portrayal, migrants and refugees ought to be resettled “close to home,” as unchecked immigration contributes to a “vicious cycle of crime, violence, and poverty,” a stance enforced as a matter of policy that absolves the U.S., the world’s richest nation, from responsibility as a migration crisis accelerates.

As long previewed by Trump aides, the president delivered another hostile address to the “corrupt dictatorship in Iran,” which Trump’s attorney winks at overthrowing despite official denials. Trump didn’t make demands of Iran, instead rattling off Iranian bellicosity and urging a world Trump spent the rest of the speech denigrating to join in the U.S. “campaign of economic pressure” and isolation.

Meanwhile, the European Union is taking deliberate steps to undermine that campaign in order to keep Iran compliant with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal that Trump’s sanctions violate.

It amounted to a declaration of white innocence on a global scale: an America victimized by a world it funds and protects but from which it receives no love or gratitude.

In Trump’s telling, all America wants from the world is to live and let live—but without consideration of the fundamental power imbalances favoring America that Trump seeks to entrench. Challenges to this arrangement come merely from “experts who [have been] proven wrong time and time again,” he asserted in a line aimed at critics of his widely condemned decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, another sign that Palestinians will not enjoy the sovereignty Trump considers so vital.

Trump’s bet at the United Nations is that he rides a tide of nationalism in the world’s developed countries strong enough to withstand the moderating forces posed by international institutions. “Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, and peace has ever prospered,” Trump lectured, neglecting the mass injustice that nations often choose to call “peace.” Thus far, Trump has seen electoral evidence, from Brexit to Poland to Hungary, of nationalism’s new appeal—even as the “hopeful futures” Trump sees in nationalist countries victimize the weakest within them. No one in the General Assembly laughed at that.","Last year, Trump gave a #MAGA rally-caliber speech defending “sovereignty” that echoed one of Vladimir Putin’s General Assembly addresses.

UNITED NATIONS, Sep 27 2018 (IPS) - Reversing years of progress, global hunger is on the rise once again and one of the culprits is clear: conflict.

A high-level side event during the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly brought together, U.N. officials, governments, and civil society to assess and recommend solutions to the pressing issue of conflict-based food insecurity.

“The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime. Yet, in some conflict settings, parties to conflict use siege tactics, weaponise starvation of civilians, or impede life-saving humanitarian supplies to reach those desperately in need."" -- Action Against Hunger’s CEO Veronique Andrieux



“Conflict-related hunger is one of the most visible manifestations to human suffering emerging from war…this suffering is preventable and thus all the more tragic,” said United States’ Agency for International Development’s (USAID) administrator Mark Green.

According to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people increased to over 820 million in 2017 from approximately 804 million in 2016, levels unseen for almost a decade.

The Global Report on Food Crises found that almost 124 million people across 51 countries faced crisis-level food insecurity in 2017, 11 million more than the year before.

Conflict was identified as the key driver in 60 percent of those cases.

The report predicts that conflict and insecurity will continue to drive food crises around the world, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Panellists during the “Breaking the Cycle Between Conflict and Hunger” side-event noted food insecurity is often a tell-tale sign of future potential conflict and can lead to further insecurity.

“Building resilience…is indeed fundamental for strengthening social cohesion, preventing conflict, and avoiding forced migration. Without that, there is no peace,” said Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. (FAO) director-general Jose Graziano da Silva.

World Food Programme’s executive director David Beasley echoed similar sentiments, stating: “If you don’t have food security, you’re not going to have any other security. So we have to address the fundamentals.”

In an effort to address conflict-based hunger and the worrisome reversal in progress, the U.N. Security Council for the first time recognised that armed conflict is closely linked to food insecurity and the risk of famine earlier this year.

The group unanimously adopted resolution 2417 condemning the use of starvation as a weapon of war and urged all parties to conflict to comply with international law and grand unimpeded humanitarian access.

While participants lauded the historic resolution, they also highlighted that it alone is not enough.

“Humanitarian action and technical solutions can mitigate the effects of food crises but we desperately need political solutions and we need to implement [resolution] 2417 if we are to reverse the shameful, upwards trajectory of hunger primarily resulting from conflict,” said Action Against Hunger’s CEO Veronique Andrieux.

In order to prevent food crises and thus conflicts from escalating, the international community must take a holistic, preventative approach and strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus.

Beasley pointed to the case of Syria where a seven-year long conflict has destroyed agricultural infrastructure, local economies, and supply chains and has left over six million food-insecure.

“The cost for us to feed a Syrian in Syria was about 50 cents a day which is almost double the normal cost because it is a war zone. If that same Syrian was in Berlin, it would be euros per day,” he told attendees.

“It is a better investment if we address the root cause as opposed to reacting after the fact,” Beasley added.

Before the long-running war began, Syria faced a drought which caused a spike in prices and led to food shortages. Many theorise that it was these very conditions that set off the civil war in 2011.

“Early action response to early warning is critical. We cannot wait for the conflict to start. We know that it will start,” said Graziano da Silva.

And it is data that can help establish early detection and prevent such crises, Graziano da Silva along with the other panelists stressed.

The Global Network against Food Crises (GNFC), which publish the Global Report on Food Crises, brings together regional and national data and analysis to provide a comprehensive picture of food insecurity globally.

It was the GNFC that enabled agencies to mitigate food crises and avert famine in northern Nigeria and South Sudan.

Just prior to the side event, FAO and the European Commission partnered to boost resilience and tackle hunger by contributing over USD70 million.

Panelists stressed the importance of such partnerships in addressing and responding to the complex issue of conflict-based food insecurity.

“At the ground, when we work together, it’s not only that we do better…we are much more efficient,” Graziano da Silva said.

Andrieux highlighted the need to uphold respect for international humanitarian law and that the U.N. and member states must hold all parties to the conflict to account.

“The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime. Yet, in some conflict settings, parties to conflict use siege tactics, weaponise starvation of civilians, or impede life-saving humanitarian supplies to reach those desperately in need,” she said.

“We believe this is failing humanity,” Andrieux added.

Green pointed to the conflict in South Sudan where fighters have blocked desperately needed humanitarian assistance and attacked aid workers.

The African nation was recently ranked the most dangerous for aid workers for the third consecutive year.

“All the parties to the conflict are culpable, all the parties to the conflict are guilty, and they have all failed themselves, their people, and humanity,” Green told attendees.

Though the task of tackling conflict-based hunger is not easy, the solutions are there. What is now required is commitment and collective action, panelists said.

“All of us working together with effective solutions—we can truly end world hunger,” Beasley said.","The Global Report on Food Crises found that almost 124 million people across 51 countries faced crisis-level food insecurity in 2017, 11 million more than the year before.

155,https://nypost.com/2018/09/19/no-global-warming-isnt-causing-worse-hurricanes/,"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",New York Post,"No, global warming isn’t causing worse hurricanes","It’s human nature to assign blame for catastrophic events. In medieval times, witches were blamed for weather woes. Trials and burnings increased when weather got worse. In hurricane season today, many find a scapegoat in global warming.

Pundits tell us “ignoring the science of climate change will hurt us” (Kristina Ball at NBC) and a Washington Post editorial declares the Trump administration complicit.

It’s a familiar drumbeat, recognizable from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Sandy. For years, Al Gore and others emphasized the need to connect extreme weather to climate change to encourage carbon cuts. Pre-Florence, things reached fever pitch, with even a claim global warming was why the hurricane’s rainfall would be (a suspiciously exact) “50 percent worse.” While Florence caused less damage than expected the drumbeat will be back come the next hurricane. Before then, the record needs correcting.

Global warming is a real issue, but the claims of ever worse hurricanes are wrong.

The UN Climate Panel found in its latest report that hurricanes (aka tropical cyclones) haven’t increased: “Current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century.”

For the United States, the trend of all land-falling hurricanes has been falling since 1900, as has that of major hurricanes. In the 51 years from 1915, Florida and the Atlantic coast were hit by 19 major hurricanes. In the 51 years to 2016, just seven. In the last 11 years, only two hurricanes greater than category 3 hit the continental USA — a record low since 1900. From 1915 to 1926, 12 hit.

We’re not seeing an increase of hurricanes. Yes, hurricane costs keep escalating. But this is not due to climate change. Rather, more people with more wealth live in harm’s way.

The US population rose four-fold over the past century, but climbed 50-fold in coastal areas. The area hurricane Florence was predicted to hit held fewer than 800,000 homes in 1940; it’s now 11.3 million — a 1,325 percent jump. Homes are bigger and hold many more expensive possessions. Adjusted for population and wealth, US hurricane damage has not increased since 1900. Global weather damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from 1990 to 2017.

Looking ahead, it is likely that hurricanes will become somewhat stronger, but less frequent. This should not cause panic. A major study in Nature put worldwide hurricane-damage costs around 0.04 percent of GDP. Accounting for an increase in prosperity (which means more resilience), by 2100 this would drop to 0.01 percent. The effect of global warming making storms fewer but stronger will see damage end up around 0.02 percent of GDP. Global warming will increase harm, but prosperity will still decrease the overall impact.

Which brings us to why carbon cuts are a terrible way to reduce hurricane damage. As a Royal Society report concluded, cutting CO₂ has “extremely limited potential to reduce future losses.”

The Paris agreement on climate change will cost in the region of $1-2 trillion a year in lost growth for the rest of this century. The UN body responsible for the treaty estimates the cuts promised until 2030 will achieve 1 percent of what would be needed to keep temperature rises under 2°C.

This means Paris could reduce hurricane damage toward the end of the century by perhaps 0.0001 percent, while the cost would be around 10,000 times higher. That is a terrible policy.

The Paris treaty is expensive and ineffectual because green energy isn’t yet competitive with fossil fuels. If it was, everyone would switch. Together, solar and wind fulfill just 0.8 percent of our energy needs, reports the International Energy Agency; that will inch to 3.6 percent in 2040 even under Paris.

We should replace Paris with a commitment to spend far more on research and development of green energy sources to make them so cheap they will outcompete fossil fuels.

A decade ago, 10 top researchers, sharply divided over whether global warming intensifies hurricanes, together pointed out that the climate connection is a distraction from “the main hurricane problem facing the United States.”

This is about vulnerability. In rich countries like America, we should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or on coastlines. We should insist on higher building standards, and increase wetlands to handle flooding. We should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building in vulnerable areas. In the world’s poorest countries, we should do more to reduce poverty, because increased prosperity is the most effective way of building resilience.

And we should stick to evidence-led policy. Blaming global-warming policy for the damage wreaked by Florence is tilting at windmills — posturing that does nothing to ameliorate hurricanes.

Bjorn Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center.","Global warming is a real issue, but the claims of ever worse hurricanes are wrong.

The president, John Magufuli, told a rally in Meatu, in the Simiyu region, that outsiders who promote birth control are giving bad advice, and that people who use contraceptives are lazy, according to local media.

“You people of Meatu keep livestock. You are good farmers. You can feed your children. Why would you opt for birth control? These are my views, but I don’t see any need for birth control in Tanzania,” he said.

People who use birth control do so because they do not want to work hard and feed a large family, he added.

The Citizen newspaper, which reported the comments, said there was no indication the statement will lead to a change in national policy. But campaigners fear Magufuli’s speech may influence services offered in some areas.

“It’s a statement by a sitting head of state at a time when Tanzania takes every statement that he issues to be law,” said Judy Gitau, regional coordinator for Africafor the charity Equality Now. “From past experiences whenever the president issues a statement on a given issue, in practice it becomes policy, and so we can expect ramifications.”

Backtracking from commitments on family planning will have a devastating impact on women’s rights, she said: “We will end up with women having unplanned children, huge families and unable to sustain their lives.”

The issue of contraception in Tanzania is a man’s decision Petrider Paul, gender equality activist

Tanzania has ratified the Maputo Protocol, which states that women have the right to control their fertility and chose any method of contraception. But access to services is limited, said Jennifer Kayombo, a youth activist in sexual and reproductive health and rights and sustainable development goal ambassador in Tanzania. “We still have less centres compared to demand for family planning services, [and] few numbers of youth-friendly service providers,” she said.

A third of women in Tanzania use family planning, according to the UN population fund, UNFPA, with access most limited in rural areas. On average, women give birth to five children.

Petrider Paul, a gender equality activist in Tanzania, said the president’s comments could be used to further undermine women’s reproductive rights. “The whole issue of contraception in Tanzania is a man’s decision. A woman cannot make her own decision to use contraceptives without the approval of the man,” said Paul. “Most men will be boastful: ‘The president has said this, we should keep producing more children. Why should we use birth control?’.”

Magufuli told the rally he had seen the harmful effects of birth control in Europe, where countries have declining population growth and no labour force. But Justa Mwaituka, the executive director of the NGO Kiota Women’s Health and Development, said birth control can be used to support large, healthy families by allowing mothers to space out pregnancies.

“Spacing [through birth control] promotes enough time for breastfeeding. A woman can at least breastfeed her child for two to two and half years as it’s recommended by the World Health Organisation,” she said.

Gitau said the situation facing Tanzanian women and girls is dire, and deteriorating.

Last year, the Magufuli commented that pregnant school girls should be banned from school, telling a rally: “As long as I am president … no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school … After getting pregnant, you are done.” Human rights groups have tried unsuccessfully to challenge the ban in the courts.","Women’s rights campaigners have expressed outrage after the Tanzanian president said there is no need for birth control.

As of Aug. 31, only 19,899 refugees had been admitted to the U.S.

That’s a dramatic reduction from years past, and next year’s cap has been set even lower.

For more than three decades, the U.S. has taken in more refugees than the rest of the world combined. By the State Department’s estimate, more than 3 million have settled in the country since 1975, as part of a state-sponsored program.

But the Trump administration’s announcement last Monday that it plans to limit the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. next year to just 30,000, down from an already a dramatic reduction, raises questions about America’s role in global refugee resettlement and what the change means for those fleeing violence and poverty around the world.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the new resettlement ceiling reflected the U.S.’s “commitment to protect the most vulnerable around the world while prioritizing the safety and well-being of the American people,” adding that the administration intended to continue to “responsibly vet applicants to prevent the entry of those who might do harm to our country.”

But experts say the decision will place added pressure on countries that are already struggling to manage large migrant flows.

How has U.S. policy evolved?

While the U.S. has led the world in refugee resettlement for more than three decades, its program was initially born out of foreign policy interests, rather than humanitarian motivation. When the U.S. resettlement program began in the 1980s, “it was really driven by Cold War concerns, and a sense of wanting to provide refuge to people fleeing regimes that the U.S. opposed,” Susan Fratzke of the Migration Policy Institute said. In the years following the fall of Saigon, the U.S. admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Vietnam and Indochina—the country welcomed 207,000 in 1980, an all-time high.

By the 1990s, the U.S. refugee program had become more humanitarian-focused, but continued to lead the rest of the world in resettlement. The program’s focus on self-sufficiency — refugees are expected to find work and support themselves as quickly as possible upon their arrival to the U.S. — is part of the reason that the American government has been able to take in more refugees than any other country over the past three decades. Other top resettlement countries with comparable systems offer more robust aid programs to refugees, according to Fratzke, and cannot necessarily afford to take in tens of thousands more.

How does the U.S. resettlement program work?

The U.S. works, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as well as other governmental and non-governmental agencies, to resettle refugees that have fled their home countries due to fear of violence or persecution. The cases referred to the U.S. are the most extreme — while the UNHCR estimates that 8 percent of the global refugee population are eligible to be resettled, less than 1 percent ever are. The process that refugees go through to enter the U.S. is different than that of asylum-seekers — whereas refugees have already fled their home countries and are submitted for resettlement through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, asylum-seekers go through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In 2016, just 11,729 immigrants were granted asylum by the USCIS.

Once the U.S. receives refugee cases from these agencies, the government conducts its own review of these individuals and decides whether or not to admit them. This process can take up to two years, and generally includes five background checks and three in-person interviews, with evaluations by eight different government agencies.

In reviewing these cases, the U.S. generally gives highest priority to refugees who are deemed to be in most urgent need of resettlement — these include persons facing serious security concerns in the original country from where they fled, victims of violence, as well as individuals who have faced persecution due to their political or religious activities. Other groups of refugees are given priority by the State Department due to special humanitarian concerns or interest in family reunification. Groups given special consideration for resettlement by the U.S. include those fleeing Cuba, as well as Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. in some capacity.

Should a refugee be accepted for resettlement by the State Department, their case is referred to one of nine private resettlement agencies that work with the U.S. government.

Once refugees arrive to the U.S., they receive support from these agencies and their affiliates, which provide basic needs such as food, clothing, housing and job assistance to these individuals during their first months of arrival. Under the government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, refugees receive cash assistance for up to eight months. After this point, the expectation is that they achieve economic self-sufficiency, meaning they earn enough to support a family without assistance from the government.

What’s changed under Trump?

During the last year that President Obama was in office, the refugee cap was set at 110,000 for fiscal year 2017. Arrivals declined significantly after President Trump was elected, and only 53,716 refugees were resettled in the U.S. during this period despite the higher quota, according to a database maintained by the State Department.

The president signed an executive order days after taking office that took direct aim at the resettlement program, barring Syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely and restricting immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. While the first ban was overturned by the courts, it had a major effect on the flow of refugees entering the country during this period, and a revised order was upheld by the Supreme Court. The Trump administration has pushed for “extreme vetting” of immigrants seeking to enter the country and rejected a Department of Health and Human Services study in the fall of that year that showed refugees had a positive economic outcome on the U.S. overall.

During a public appearance last June, the president said “the U.S. will not be a migrant camp, and it will not be a refugee holding facility.” The new 30,000 cap echos that statement.

‘No one is going to be able to fill the gap’

The U.S. decision puts added pressure on countries already overwhelmed by the migrant crisis, but the drop in refugee resettlement is not just a U.S. trend. The overall global number of refugee resettlement places was down by 54 percent in 2017, with only 75,200 available spots, according to the UNHCR. The year before, the number of resettlement places made available by host countries was at 163,200, the highest in 20 years. While the UNHCR estimated that 1.2 million refugees were eligible for resettlement in 2017, the agency submitted just 102,800 cases to host countries.

“We’re disappointed to see global refugee numbers reduced, including in the United States,” says Gary Seidman, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner on Refugees.

Since President Trump took office in January of 2017, some 30,000 migrants have crossed the Canadian border from the U.S. with hopes that they’ll have a better shot at staying in Canada. The influx of asylum-seekers has prompted some in the Canadian government to question the country’s Safe Third Country agreement with the U.S., which for years mandated that migrants arriving on either side of the border apply for asylum in the first country they arrived.

In dealing with high numbers of asylum-seekers fleeing violence in Africa and the Middle East, Europe’s share spiked to 57 percent in 2017, after taking in 9 to 13 percent of resettlement cases referred by the UNHCR in previous years, in large part due to the significant drop on the U.S. side. At the same time, a resurgence of anti-immigrant sentiment, driven by the rise of far-right political parties throughout the continent, has stoked anxiety in countries such as Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel faced politically perilous backlash for her commitment to welcoming one million refugees starting in 2015.

“Even if they fall for a couple of years, it doesn’t mean that those that aspired to get to Europe or North America have gone away.”

With such a major shift in refugee policy, will other countries step up to become leaders in resettlement? It’s unlikely that any will take in refugees at the volume that America once did because no other resettlement program is quite like the one in the U.S.

Even during a year when resettlement policy shifted dramatically, UNHCR numbers indicate that the U.S. still topped the list of resettlement countries in 2017: it resettled 24,599 individuals referred by the UN agency; more than Canada at 8,912, and the UK, which took in 6,202.

“No one is going to be able to fill the gap left by the U.S.,” says Fratzke. “No country is going to come in and fill those 50,000 places.”

None of this will lessen the flow of immigrants fleeing distress in countries such as Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, or Myanmar, which is why Anthony Messina, a political science professor specializing in European migration at Trinity College, envisions the global migrant situation becoming even tighter in the coming years: “One has to sort of think of this as a container or bottle that is filling up,” he says. “Even if they fall for a couple of years, it doesn’t mean that those that aspired to get to Europe or North America have gone away.”","With just six days left, it’s highly unlikely that the U.S. will reach its refugee resettlement cap of 45,000 for fiscal year 2018.
In the years following the fall of Saigon, the U.S. admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Vietnam and Indochina—the country welcomed 207,000 in 1980, an all-time high.
By the 1990s, the U.S. refugee program had become more humanitarian-focused, but continued to lead the rest of the world in resettlement.
Under the government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, refugees receive cash assistance for up to eight months.
The overall global number of refugee resettlement places was down by 54 percent in 2017, with only 75,200 available spots, according to the UNHCR."

At United States borders, Mediterranean shores, and Asian cities, millions are fleeing war, hunger, and persecution in search of safety and shelter. And scientists believe things will only get worse due to climate change.

Extreme events like a prolonged drought in the Sahel region are causing a massive environmental migration crisis. (Photo: Pablo Tosco/Oxfam)

The office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that rising seas, intensifying droughts, and other extreme weather events will uproot 250 million people by 2050. Like most other refugees, climate refugees are expected to come largely from developing nations in Africa, Asia, and South America. But unlike those escaping war and persecution, climate refugees have few legal protections.

""The 1951 Refugee Convention's definition of 'refugee' does not include people who are fleeing environmental stress,"" says Alice Thomas, the climate displacement program manager at the non-profit group Refugees International. To date, no individual has been able to successfully claim asylum on the grounds that they are fleeing climate change, Thomas says, though some have tried.

And there is another climate reality, according to Thomas, that is rarely recognized: the fact that most climate-affected migrants will not be leaving their countries.

""International migration is really complex. Most people, the poorest people, can't afford to migrate internationally,"" she says. ""There needs to be focus on these what we call 'trapped populations,' people who are too poor to even move and escape climate effect.""

A 2018 World Bank report suggests that these trapped populations might number over 140 million people by 2050. That's why Thomas says countries worldwide need an internal migration policy. Such policies should help people who need to move and resettle within their own nation so they are not stateless. Smart climate change adaptation policies may even make it possible so that people don't have to move in the first place.

""They need to build resilience to more drought. They need to build houses that are hurricane- and flood-proof,"" Thomas says. ""That's why it's the poorest people who are most affected. People living in informal homes or shacks in Bangladesh or Haiti or even in Puerto Rico are among those who will be worst-affected and most likely to be compelled to move.""

Thomas has been working on these very issues for nearly a decade. In an interview with Bhanu Sridharan for Mongabay, the former environmental lawyer breaks down the issue of climate migration and steps that need to be taken both internationally and by individual nations to help the most vulnerable adapt to a crisis not of their making.

How did you become interested in climate change and the potential for climate change to lead to migration and the refugee crisis?

I am an environmental lawyer. I have practiced international environmental law and policy for most of my career. When Refugees International decided to start this program, there really weren't any other organizations at that time [2009] that were focused on the need to do advocacy around the human impacts of climate change, specifically on displacement and migration. I was very interested in this job because I was very interested in defending communities who were vulnerable to climate change and because those who were most likely to be impacted were those who had the least responsibility for the climate crisis.

Can you tell us a little bit more about Refugees International? What is your organization's objective with regard to climate migration?

Refugees International is an independent non-government organization that advocates for improved assistance and protection for refugees, those who are displaced internally within their own countries, and who are displaced by other events like climate change, disasters, and gang violence. The organization has been around for almost four decades advocating for refugees around the world. It is a totally independent organization. We don't take any U.N. funding and we don't take any government funding. And that allows us to advocate fiercely only on behalf of displaced people who are our constituents.

RI's climate displacement program is focused on different countries that are experiencing climate stress. One goal has been to improve international protection for people who are forced to flee their home countries because of climate change. The other goal has been to find ways to improve the response to people who are displaced by extreme weather or climate change-related effects.

Human beings have been moving because of environmental changes for millennia. What is the difference between that and the climate migration we see today?

Well, it's true that people have been moving for millennia. Migration has always been an adaptation strategy for people who are experiencing environmental stress. To this day, in large parts of Africa, pastoralists move because they need to go where there's pasture and there's water.

The problem with climate change is that it takes us outside the historic bounds of weather and climate ranges that people have adapted to over millennia. It's taking us into extremes beyond what's normal. People can't adapt to those changes fast enough.

For example, in Africa, especially the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa, people are extremely vulnerable to even minor changes in weather and climate. They are extremely poor and depend solely on rain-fed agriculture to survive. Their planting seasons correspond to rainy seasons that occur maybe twice a year. Once it starts raining, they'll plant and harvest their crop. But now what they are seeing—and I've witnessed this when I visited—is that the patterns of rain are no longer normal. The rains will start on time, and they will go out and plant, but then the rains will just stop, and their crops will wither and die. These changes in rainfall patterns can affect their ability to grow food. And because it's outside the normal pattern, they can't predict or plan for it.

Most people use the term ""climate refugee."" But people who are displaced by environmental events can't claim asylum or protection as refugees right now. Why is that?

That's correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention's definition of ""refugee"" does not include people who are fleeing environmental stress. Other regional conventions could potentially cover people who are fleeing climate change-related effects. But there haven't been any cases that I am aware of where people have been granted asylum only on the grounds that they were fleeing climate change. There was one case in New Zealand where someone from [the islands of] Kiribati tried to claim asylum on that ground. But the court found that there was not a sufficient showing of climate impacts on that person to qualify for asylum.

Your organization has been engaged in the development of the U.N. Global Compact on Refugees and Migration recently. Was this issue raised in the meeting? Are there steps being taken now to correct this?

There are actually two global compacts happening in parallel. One is a Global Compact on Refugees and the other is a Global Compact on Migration. The Refugees Compact is limited in scope to refugees as defined under the 1951 Convention. So it will not end up being a document that would broaden the definition of a refugee to include persons forced to flee the effects of climate change. And that's not what it was trying to do. It was trying to address the current refugee crisis. But it acknowledges that there may be forms of mixed movement where people may be trying to flee both conflict and the effects of climate change.

The Global Compact on Migration is a different beast. It is setting out new (non-binding) commitments by governments around the world with respect to international migration. There is consensus in the room among U.N. member states that there needs to be cooperation on how to address the issue of climate- and disaster-induced migration. And there's recognition that the countries that are going to be the worst impacted by this, especially small island developing states, really need to have new opportunities for migration for their people.

What sorts of solutions are being looked at with small island developing states?

The small island developing states have been for a long time—gosh, probably more than a decade—asking the international community to do something about the risk that they are facing. They have brought this issue to the U.N. Human Rights Council and there's recognition that this is a violation of their peoples' human rights and a threat to their existence. But there's been no real solution to this.

We are now aware that the impacts of climate change are already locked in for small island states. Given that reality, they are now urging the international community to support them to adapt to those effects, including expanding legal migration pathways.

What role does the Paris Agreement play in dealing with this issue?

Climate change as a driver of migration and displacement has been recognized earlier by the Conference of Parties to the U.N. climate convention. The Paris accord set up a task force in late 2015 to look at measures to avert, minimize, and address climate displacement. The task force is now working to develop a set of recommendations that it will be sharing at the upcoming climate talks in Poland, at the end of this year. And countries need to start looking at those recommendations and adopting them in their national plan of action. And we need to ensure that countries that need financial assistance to implement those measures get financial assistance.

Refugees are increasingly unwelcome in big developed nations like the United States and parts of the European Union. Do these countries have a different stance on climate migrants?

The U.S. has traditionally been and continues to be the lead donor for humanitarian assistance globally. However, the current administration's proposed budget sought to slash humanitarian aid and that's including to countries that have been the worst affected by climate change. Luckily, we continue to have bipartisan support in Congress for humanitarian assistance programs. So proposals by the administration to significantly cut back humanitarian aid have been rejected and humanitarian support maintained, although it is still nowhere near as much as is needed.

But we still need to see more investment for disaster risk reduction and much more for climate change adaptation. Even under former administrations, [the U.S.] hadn't done enough to help countries adapt to climate change, but it was making an effort. Under this administration we have seen funding for climate change adaptation zeroed out.

Europe in this time period has really stepped up a lot in dealing with climate mitigation and humanitarian assistance, but unfortunately they do not have a very friendly refugee or migration policy right now. Canada has emerged as a real leader in all ways.

A lot of migration is internal, i.e. people moving within their own country. Are you concerned about that aspect as well? Or are you only concerned when people have to leave their nation-state and move to another country?

Right now, the evidence shows that most people [affected by climate change] will migrate or be displaced internally. So it needs to be addressed. And I feel there is a lot of opportunity in the coming decade to prevent this sort of migration. To help people who don't want to move and stay in place adapt.

But for those migrating, we also need to prepare for that as well. Part of the problem is that there's no policy for internal migration in most countries. This has all come to a head in Alaska, where impoverished indigenous communities want to relocate because the Arctic is warming so quickly. There are dozens of native Alaskan communities that want to move inland, because they are literally falling into the water as the permafrost melts beneath them. They don't even want to move very far inland. But there is no legal or administrative framework to do that. They don't have federal or state funds to set up infrastructure in advance of their move. So this lack of policies and laws for internal migration is also a very big gap right now.

Do you think focusing on poverty alleviation or infrastructure in the countries impacted may help?

Fighting poverty will help, but all of our policies, whether humanitarian strategies or development strategies, need to incorporate climate change. They need to do things differently than they did in the past. They need to build resilience to more drought. They need to build houses that are hurricane- and flood-proof. That's why it's the poorest people who are most affected. People living in informal homes or shacks in Bangladesh or Haiti or even in Puerto Rico are among those who will be worst-affected and most likely to be compelled to move.

Are there any wealthy communities that have also been forced to move because of climate stress?

It's almost always that poor communities don't have the resources to move and those are the people we are focused on. But if you look at Hurricane Katrina [in New Orleans], you had a city with both poor and rich communities. A lot of wealthy people with means who lost their homes in the storm were able to rebuild their homes to better standards or they just went somewhere else. They were able to find what we call a ""durable solution"" to their displacement. What the evidence shows is that the people who didn't find a durable solution to displacement were poor African-American communities living in the Lower Ninth ward.

I think that, after disasters, wealthy people are able to rebuild or move. They did so in the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma and in Puerto Rico. But the people who lived in the trailer parks in the Keys, I don't know what happened to those people.

I think the issue of climate migration garnered a lot of attention because of the Syrian crisis, the idea that a drought led to the civil war and that led to displacement. What do you think?

With respect to Syria, I haven't analyzed the situation myself, but I think the literature shows that it hasn't been firmly established that there was a direct link between the drought and civil war. And that corresponds to the broader literature. There are not many cases where climate events, like droughts, directly led people to pick up arms and go to war with each other. Rather, the evidence shows that climate-related disasters can lead to other forms of social stress or mental stress. They can also aggravate pre-existing tension. Where societies are predisposed to racial or ethnic tensions, climate change can aggravate the situation.

Are there any examples of this?

Well, in Somalia there's been another very protracted drought and more than 800,000 people have been internally displaced. And there the terrorist organization al-Shabaab has been taking advantage of this and intimidating people who need food and water. They have been blocking humanitarian aid from coming into affected areas.

Mostly this doesn't sound like a cheerful job. Are you optimistic that progress will be made?

As much as I have been frustrated by the slow pace of action, the fact that you're seeing this climate displacement task force within the UNFCCC and the Global Compacts on Migration and Refugees trying to create international cooperation on this, represents important progress. When I started eight years ago, we didn't have that. So we have seen that discussions have moved; states have moved. Even in a really bad political climate, even in a xenophobic political climate, even in an anti-refugee political climate, we have seen common sense and human morality prevail. Not doing anything is no longer acceptable.

160,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/no-lost-generation-after-isil-children-iraq-are-given-second-chance-learning-friendship,"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,"No lost generation: After ISIL, children in Iraq are given a second chance at learning, friendship, and life - Iraq","After the fall of so-called Islamic State (ISIL) and the recapture of Hawiga in October 2017, life is slowly returning to normal in the area. People are returning, and children are going back to school. However, many schools are in dire need of rehabilitation and lack supplies and learning materials. Since many boys and girls were not able to attend school in the last three years due to the conflict, they are now struggling to catch up whilst also processing the distress suffered through the war.

The past four years have been turmoil for the people of Hawiga district in northern Iraq. The ISIL occupation followed by military actions to retake the area in late 2017 pushed thousands of families out of their homes (REACH 2017), and left them facing severe shortages of food, water, and medicine. While occasional fighting continues in the district, more than 120,000 people have returned (IOM 2018). Returning, however, is not easy. This is especially true for children, who are amongst the most vulnerable.

Poverty and conflict have interrupted education for millions of children

Poverty and conflict have disrupted education for 3,000,000 children in the country (UNICEF 2018). Boys and girls across Iraq, including in Hawiga, have lost years of schooling. They have seen unprecedented levels of violence and often suffer from post-war distress. 74.1% of internally displaced children in Kirkuk province have witnessed “events beyond the normal boundaries of human experience” during the conflict, according to a survey by Public Aid Organization. Moreover, children are now exposed to new threats such as loss or separation from family, abuse, exploitation and security risks. According to the same survey, 22% of children live unaccompanied and separated from family.

Being exposed to violence for years, children need long-term protection and psychosocial support

The education and child protection services available in Iraq are severely limited and lack the capacity to cope with the increase in needs. To regain a sense of normalcy, children need a protective environment in the community. The children of today are tomorrow’s teachers, doctors, engineers and scientists. The restoration of education, as well as strengthening of child protection services, is critical in establishing stability and fostering the development of Iraq.

“That’s why we teamed up with ACTED, to support 3,000 children affected by the conflict in Hawiga. Both People in Need and ACTED have long term experience in addressing the education and protection needs of children in Iraq,” says Lorena Martin, Education in Emergencies Program Manager for People in Need (PIN).

Even though schools have started to reopen this year in Hawiga, they lack basic facilities and equipment as well as teaching and learning materials. “They have non-functional toilets, broken windowpanes, broken electricity infrastructure etc. In areas where returns have started, there are 60-70 students in one classroom. Schools in other areas, however, do not have more than 200 children yet. Most of the teaching staff are community volunteers who need capacity building on pedagogy and psychosocial support, and some of them do not get a salary,“ Lorena Martin described.

3,000 children affected by the conflict in Hawiga will be supported by People in Need and ACTED

PIN trains teachers and facilitators in how to use psychosocial support tools and recreational activities to reduce stress and foster their pupils' resilience. They learn how to teach catch-up and remedial classes, which help children who missed years of school during the ISIL occupation fill in the gaps of their education. Volunteer teachers who do not receive salary will also get incentives. Schools will also receive new teaching and learning materials and equipment such as air coolers, fans and water coolers to help ease discomfort during the hot summers. Outside the classrooms, PIN and ACTED will target children who are out of school with a “Back-to-School” campaign whilst raising awareness about child protection through community mobilisation.

Darby Lee, ACTED Child Protection Project Manager, adds: “ACTED will apply its expertise on implementing integrated Child Protection and Education services in West Mosul to the Hawiga context, notably through working with communities and providing case management to boys and girls affected by crisis in the aftermath of the war. Sustained case management services and community mobilisation activities will allow children to regain a sense of normalcy by creating a protective environment for them in the community as a whole.”

ACTED will continue providing case management for the most vulnerable children, including unaccompanied and separated children through psychological first aid, disseminating key messages within the community about the available services and referring specific cases to specialised service providers. ACTED will also further extend its community mobilisation and awareness-raising activities in Hawiga, facilitating sessions and campaigns for children and adults. It will focus on improving psychological well-being of children and their caregivers, empowering community members to work towards the protection of their children and to advocate for their own children's rights, contributing to building resilience and reducing future risks.

People in Need and its Alliance2015 partner ACTED, provide assistance to conflict affected children in Hawiga district with support of the European Commission through its Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).

“When he left Iran in 2009, he lived in Malaysia for a few years as well as a few months in the Republic of Georgia. He never traveled to the US,” a source with knowledge of Marzban’s case told the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on September 19, 2018.

The sources that provided testimony for this report requested anonymity for security reasons.

“You couldn’t find a more harmless and gentle person than Keyomars to frame?” tweeted fellow Iranian satirist Sharagim Zand on September 17.

“[President Hassan] Rouhani and his supporters say Iranian expats should come back to the country and work here but what they want is an easy target to prey on and fabricate charges against him in another putrid spectacle by the security intelligence establishment,” added Zand.

Marzban is not a dual citizen. He did not experience any problems upon first returning to Iran about a year ago to visit his ailing grandmother.

On September 12, a website affiliated with the IRGC, Edalatkhahan (Justice Seekers), claimed Marzban had traveled to the US with the intention of launching an anti-Iranian media outlet “aimed at inflaming the people and creating social divisions.”

Edalatkhahan accused Marzban of working with Freedom House, a human rights organization based in Washington, DC, to attract Iranian artists and celebrities towards opposition causes.

Agents of the IRGC’s Intelligence Organization took Marzban into custody at his home on August 26 and confiscated his laptop, mobile phone and other personal belongings. Since then he has made only one brief phone call to his family without mentioning his arrest, according to the source.

“Keyomars loves to write and although he’s very young, he has matured a lot in recent years,” one of his friends told CHRI. “He has no political sympathies toward any individual or political group and his main passion is writing and being involved in literary activities.”

“We are shocked he has been arrested,” added his friend.

On April 17, Marzban gave an interview to the state-funded Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) about his private writing classes and his experiences abroad.

“Iranians have very limited hopes and dreams,” he said. “Their biggest dream is for the economic problems to be solved and all they think about is their daily affairs. But when I asked people in other countries about this, I realized that imagination and following your dreams is a very important thing.”

Marzban began his artistic career making short films. While living in Malaysia, he hosted a comedy podcast called “Sangetab Radio” (Twisted Stone Radio) and in 2014 he published a book of short stories titled Kham Bodam Pokhteh Shodam Balkeh Pasandideh Shodam (I was Raw, I Became Ripe and Pleasant).

Satirist Mahmoud Farjami, who lives in exile in Europe, tweeted: “They arrested Keyomars Marzban? For what crime exactly? ‘Misleading’ celebrities? Those who accuse him of such ridiculous things, are they retarded? I won’t ask if they’ve got a conscience… (By the way, Keyomars has never traveled to the US and he’s only twenty-something.)”

Iranian security forces have accused numerous citizens with links to foreign countries of spying with scant evidence, ultimately getting them locked up for years on trumped-up national security charges.

In March 2018, agents of Iran’s Intelligence Ministry arrested Iranian citizen and British Council employee Aras Amiri and held her for two months without access to a lawyer.

At least 12 dual and foreign nationals, as well as foreign permanent residents, were imprisoned in Iran as of September 2018 according to research by CHRI.","Keyomars Marzban, a 26-year-old satirist, has been held incommunicado in Tehran’s Evin Prison and without access to counsel since the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) arrested him on August 26, 2018.

In what's likely the largest displacement of people in modern South American history, about seven per cent of Venezuela's peak population of 32.8 million had left by June, some 2.3 million in all, according to the UN. Venezuela's population outflow to the rest of the world more than doubled between 2015 and 2017.

Venezuelans have fled in search of better lives in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. Colombia has been the most ostensibly welcoming of the South American countries, with hundreds of thousands crossing the border just within the past two years.

It is a reversal of the flow of migrants that occurred when Colombia was wracked by sectarian violence for years and Venezuela was prospering due to a healthy international oil market.

There is no formal shelter system in place in Colombia, however, so thousands of Venezuelans not able to legally work are selling their wares in public spaces or offering their services for work door to door.

The Crespos from Valencia, Venezuela, are one such family. CBC News recently witnessed the family flagging down motorists beside a busy roadway in Colombia near the border trying to find buyers for their handicrafts to make a bit of money.

Armed with stacks of old bolivar banknotes, the essentially worthless currency was being sewn and reshaped to make wallets and purses. The asking price was 10,000 pesos, or about $3 Cdn.

Venezuela's crisis-stricken economy prompts people to get creative with the piles of money that can't buy them food The National 1:06 Adrienne Arsenault meets family using almost worthless currency to make goods to sell. 1:06

Approximately 100 bolivars would have fed the family for a month about five years ago.

New, but not so improved

It may be a creative measure in a desperate situation, but it has appalled the UN ambassador from the United States, the most ardent critic of the Venezuelan regime.

""Something is very wrong when citizens of an oil-rich country have to leave in order to beg on Colombian streets to feed their children,"" Nikki Haley said at an informal meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday. ""That something is the corruption of the Maduro regime.""

(CBC)

Echoing unsuccessful monetary policy interventions in Zimbabwe, President Nicholas Maduro in late August heralded the new soberano bolivar and a host of accompanying measures intended to put the brakes on hyperinflation and help an economy experts say is heading for its third straight year of double-digit contraction.

Economists at the International Monetary Fund had predicted the previous month the inflation rate by the end of the year could top one million per cent without intervention.

With soaring prices for staple items due to shortages, earlier this year some companies were offering bonuses in eggs not cash to hungry Venezuelans.

The new sovereign bolivar (VES) is a currency devalued by a factor of 100,000 compared to the old, and pegged to the petro, a new, elusive cryptocurrency measurement tied to oil reserves.

So while the sleight-of-hand means there aren't the eye-popping figures of recent weeks that equate to a month or more of salary for the average Venezuelan — 7.5 million bolivars (VEF) for a kilogram of chicken, for example — there is not yet any price relief, and additional layers of confusion have been added to an already fraught situation for people trying to get by.

People flocked to stores ahead of Maduro's announcement — some hoping to stock up, and others to profit by reselling items on the black market.

Significant price differences

Since the change, daily limits on ATM withdrawals have been set at 10 new bolivars. At that rate, it would take five days of withdrawals to buy a half-carton of 18 eggs.

Prices in regions near the borders of South American neighbours are higher than in Caracas. Items are cheaper when paid in cash rather than by debit card, but some markets may not accept cash at all.

Maduro has introduced a minimum wage increase of 3,500 per cent effective Sept. 1 to help Venezuelans cope with the prices.

Most employers can't afford such an abrupt increase, so the government has introduced a so-called Homeland card, where deposits can be made to an account tied to an individual's bank account.

In addition to added confusion, in a country where the press has been muzzled and the assembly and judiciary stacked with Maduro loyalists, it gives the government a level of oversight that makes many people uneasy.

Another significant measure from a government looking to replenish its own coffers is the first significant rise in gas prices in 20 years, to be rolled out beginning this month.

It's a necessary move in the sense that, according to experts quoted by Reuters, Venezuela has been losing up to $5 billion US from fuel sales every year because it subsidizes gas well below international market rate.

But it may bring a new kind of pain in the short term for many Venezuelans.

One Venezuelan told CBC News this week he got up at 4 a.m. to fuel up. The line to the pumps can be measured in kilometres and take hours to complete.

""[I'm] quite pissed,"" he said. ""The Venezuelan government got us used to this.""

But in the end, he is still filling the tank. If Maduro's planned changes are introduced haphazardly, as too often has been the case in recent years in Venezuela, it may be too prohibitive for him to drive at all.

Worsening ambient air quality due rising air pollution levels is fast emerging as one the greatest health risks faced by Indian citizens.

According to a report published by the Lancet Commission on pollution and health (2015), India accounted for the highest number of premature deaths 92.5 million) due to air pollution. More recently, the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Global Ambient Air Quality Index has pointed out that 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world are in India. These figures highlight how air pollution is becoming a problem with catastrophic proportions for India and may soon become a part of the veritable roster of hazards that routinely assail this country.

This issue of Southasiadisasters.net is titled ""Is Air Pollution a Disaster in Indian Cities?"" and takes a close look at the problem of air pollution in India. It not only highlights the underlying causes of the problem of air pollution but also discusses the possible institutional and operational solutions to address this insidious risk. It is important to remember that poverty and pollution go hand in hand. This poses a great challenge for a developing country like India which has a large population. Two thirds of India's population still lives outside of cities, and 80 percent of these households rely on biomass like wood and dung for cooking and heating. Agricultural practices like burning crop stubble also remain widespread. Couple this with weak enforcement of anti-pollution laws and regulations in India and a clearer picture of this crisis starts to emerge.

This issue also highlights success stories in addressing air pollution from different countries for. Most importantly, it shows how the triple challenges of governance, technological innovation and behavioural change need to be overcome for addressing the problem of air pollution in India effectively.","About This IssueWorsening ambient air quality due rising air pollution levels is fast emerging as one the greatest health risks faced by Indian citizens.

164,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/12/homelessness-radical-solution-homes-housing-first,"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,The radical solution to homelessness: no-strings homes,"Bruce spits out his stories in fragments not sentences. Dates are missing, details go awol. But you listen anyway because he’s got some tales, and he knows it. Like the one about the time he died. Steaming drunk, he’d been arrested. Back then, Bruce would drink or take anything he could get his hands on. Methylated spirit and aftershave. Tranquillisers and magic mushrooms. He’d sniff petrol and glue, which made him feel “like a rubber band”.

This time, he’d drunk so much he fell unconscious in a Staffordshire police station and “swallowed my tongue”. He stopped breathing, the vital signs went, and for a while they thought he was dead: “Paramedics brought me round in A&E.” Lazarus showed neither gratitude nor wisdom. “I was violent, so I got rearrested.” Years later, the memory makes him cackle.

After being slung out of the family home as a teenager, Bruce spent nearly 30 years homeless and saw a lot of police stations and hospitals. He stayed in so many prisons he can rattle off an itinerary: the juvenile lock-up at Werrington, near Stoke, when he was growing up. Strangeways, Lincoln, Stoke Heath, Dovegate, Risley, Walton … When an older sister died of breast cancer, he attended her funeral in handcuffs.

Detox units took him in – then lobbed him back into his old world, where he could start drinking all over again

Most nights, he slept rough: up on roofs in freezing winds, down by the River Trent under damp railway arches, in the giant abandoned kilns that still dot the Potteries. Monasteries and convents would give food and shelter. Most of all, Bruce kept on the move: “I could walk the mileage, mate: 40 miles a day, seven days a week. I could walk the planet.”

He, his partner Louise (not their real names) and their Jack Russell terrier Skip would walk from coast to coast, from Newcastle right down to Great Yarmouth. “I love London,” he says. “Haven’t been back for years.” And for a moment he sounds like a tourist rhapsodising over some golden holiday, except his landmarks aren’t in any Lonely Planet. “Cardboard City: stayed there.”

For decades, this was his life. Authority figures were either useless or positively harmful. His mum walked out when he was four; later, he and his brothers and sisters were sent to an institution in north Wales. “Like a mental asylum. Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Abuse?” Now he’s shouting. “You wouldn’t know what it was. And you wonder why I cracked.”

Prisons released him straight out on to the streets. Detox units took him in, cleaned him up – then lobbed him back into his old world, where he could start drinking all over again. After a concrete block fell on his leg and shattered it, a hospital fixed up his shin – then discharged him with a Zimmer frame but nowhere to sleep. A therapist expected him to shuffle along the streets with all his gear plus some NHS-issue aluminium. “Fucking useless.” It was swiftly donated to the nearest canal.

Tonight in one of the world’s richest countries, more than 300,000 people won’t have a home to call their own. They will sleep instead in temporary accommodation, in homeless hostels, in rooms provided by social services – and in the worst case out on the streets. Since 2010, the official number of rough sleepers like Bruce has soared 134% to 4,751 – and that is almost certainly an underestimate. The charity Crisis puts the number at 8,000 in England alone, with a further 8,000 seeking refuge in tents, cars and on buses and trains.

Their stories rarely end happily. Most of the rough sleepers Bruce knew are now dead. On the streets, a man can expect to die at about 47; for a woman sleeping rough, death comes more quickly, at 43, compared with 83 for the average British woman.

At 51, Bruce is beating the odds. Having spent most of his life unsure where he’ll sleep, he now has a home of his own. Come Christmas, he’ll have been in his one-bed flat for five years. The coffee table, the sofa and most of the rest were bought with his own cash. He gets his groceries from Asda and knocks up a decent curry. The day we meet, he’s looking forward to Emmerdale: “It’s getting good. Lachlan’s on a mission.”

In a neat black shirt and with sandy hair turning the colour of salt, the only immediate giveaways of his past life are the self-harm scars that ladder both wrists and the way he comes in and out of lucidity, like sunshine on a cloudy autumn day. But after decades of being ignored or abused, of drinking himself nearly to death on any cut-price poison, his life is now almost as uneventful as yours or mine.

How did this happen? The simple answer is politics. Or, to be more precise, a policy called Housing First. It has been adopted by Finland, Denmark, Spain and France, as well as parts of the US and Canada. In every country, the transformation has been astonishing. In the UK, Labour likes the idea, and the Tories are piloting it. But while Westminster makes warm noises, some councils and local groups are getting on and doing it. In Stoke three years ago, the Voices partnership used National Lottery funding to commission a Housing First programme. Among the first on it was Bruce.

Housing First argues that the main thing a homeless person needs is a home. Give that and dedicated support to help someone adjust to a new way of living, and the rest will slowly fall into place. The drug taking will go down, the illnesses will get less frequent and less serious. And time after time it works. Yet however simple that sounds, it’s the opposite of how homeless people are usually treated.

In London and Manchester, property developers keep people from sleeping in their doorways by putting up metal spikes. Those bedding down in Bournemouth coach station have been blasted with bagpipe music, by order of the council. Last winter, a Torbay businessman stuck up pictures of people he said were “professional beggars”. And Stoke council was last year planning to fine rough sleepers £1,000 each – until critics pointed out that if they had a grand spare, they probably wouldn’t be on the streets. Underpinning all this casual cruelty is a prejudice that says Britain is a property-owning democracy, and those without a property don’t deserve full democratic rights. It’s an attitude that runs wide and deep, to some of our most basic services.

This spring, researchers in Stoke found that barely one in four local GPs were willing to register homeless patients without restriction. Practices would demand someone of no fixed abode provide a utility bill with an address – or simply refused to treat them. This is despite the Care Quality Commission saying it “expects practices to register people who are homeless” and even advising them to put down the surgery’s address on registration forms.

To stand a chance of securing stable accommodation, homeless people across the UK usually need to prove they’re “housing ready”. Lay off the booze, and you too might win a “transitional unit”. Opposed to that system is Housing First, where you don’t earn a roof over your head but are treated as if you’re entitled to one.

As the most enthusiastic adopter of Housing First, Finland is the only European Union country where homelessness is not rising but falling – by an average of 35% between 2008 and 2015. The problem of rough sleeping has to all intents and purposes been solved.

Along with his new flat, Bruce got a support worker, Tim Ditchfield. After hanging out for almost five years, they know each other like friends. At the beginning Ditchfield planned what Bruce needed to live his new life the way he wanted. And he argued with doctors and therapists and officials to get him proper support. “Together, we try and get round the gatekeepers,” Ditchfield says.

Ditchfield introduced Bruce to charity shops, which is where most of his furniture comes from. And Bruce has responded to the trust placed in him. He pays all his rent in cash, three months up front. He has barely used the discretionary fund available to local Housing First tenants: with only the modest benefits owed to him, he has constructed a tightly budgeted lifestyle.

The stability that comes from having a roof over his head has spread to all parts of his life. While he still drinks, Ditchfield says “he is not obliterating himself any more”. Most striking, Bruce is now saving up for a bungalow to get away from his noisy neighbours. “I want tranquillity now, mate.”

In the year before Bruce moved into his flat, he was in A&E 20 times; spent one night as a hospital inpatient; was arrested twice; appeared before a magistrate once; was convicted once; and was in a cell for two nights. Going by official calculations for the cost of each of these, Bruce put £5,139 worth of demand on our public services.

Over the following three years, he did none of these things – apart from one spell when he was in and out of A&E a few times. But no serious illness, no law breaking, no prison. Plus: no use of police time, no grief from the council, no damage to property. And he is entirely typical. The support of Ditchfield and his colleagues costs, but a York University study of nine Housing First schemes in 2015 estimated that the policy offered “overall savings in public expenditure that could be in excess of £15,000 per person per annum”.

The policy doesn’t work for everyone. Running the Housing First programme in Stoke, Jane Turner also knows its pitfalls. Some rough sleepers can’t cope with bill-paying domesticity. Others find that their old mates from the street move in and cause havoc. Having worked at a homeless hostel for five years, Turner knows their advantages. Security, three hot meals a day, regular check-ups. She also sees when they fail: “You get people coming into hostels, going through them and out – and then coming back again.” At the hostel where she worked in the late 1990s, she sees some of the same rough sleepers she saw 20 years ago. Without Bruce’s luck, they haven’t broken out of the life-shortening vicious cycle.

The charity Crisis believes Housing First could help more than 18,000 people in Britain – not just rough sleepers, but other people with complex housing needs. When the Finns made this a national strategy, they also built thousands of low-rent flats. In Stoke, they rely on housing associations and private landlords. When Ditchfield’s colleague Mike Goodwin rings round letting agents, they say: “No DSS”. Or they demand six months’ rent up front. The result is that Turner has 10 people waiting to be housed.

On the floor of Bruce’s living room are a few laminated photos of his dad’s grave. After hearing him talking about his dad so often, Ditchfield drove Bruce to see it. They bought flowers from the local shop, crouched silently at the graveside, then, remembers Ditchfield, “sat like a pair of old blokes on a bench, reminiscing about old times”. The pictures were given to Bruce as a reminder of that day.

You would never get that in the normal run of public services – and that is what makes Housing First so alluring. It is a reminder that the welfare state doesn’t have to be mean and pinched. That the only reason families wait years for a home, or sick people get only 10 minutes with a GP, is because successive governments have refused to put the money in.

Like universal basic income, Housing First is as much a challenge as a policy. What if we were to say that poor people aren’t poor because of a character flaw but simply because they don’t have money? What if homeless people deserve a home, as the UN says is a universal right? What if those who need help from the state got it, rather than incessant bullying?

“Housing First makes politicians nervous. It smacks of queue jumping,” says Andy Meakin, director of Voices. But it’s more radical than that: it raises the question of why there should be queues for an essential like housing.

Underneath those graveside photos is another laminate: a letter from Bruce to his partner. It dates from when they were in the same mental health hospital but could barely see each other. In Bruce’s handwriting, neat and round, it reads: “I still love you in my heart, as a friend, partner, I know you feel the same way … lonely and lost, your [sic] the only person I care for, you deserve a better life … your [sic] my Bonnie Louise.” Along the bottom runs the acronym SWALK.

Louise and Bruce, Bonnie and Clyde. Together for 30 hard years. Let’s hope they get the chance to turn into a pair of boring old sods.","Since 2010, the official number of rough sleepers like Bruce has soared 134% to 4,751 – and that is almost certainly an underestimate.

NAIROBI, September 13, 2018 - Somalia’s economy is projected to grow at an annual rate of 3–4 percent, according to the third Somalia Economic Update (SEU) published by the World Bank. Titled “Rapid Growth in Mobile Money: Stability or Vulnerability?”, the SEU assesses Somalia’s vibrant mobile money market, and provides concrete recommendations on introducing mobile money regulation that can boost a secure system for widespread financial inclusion.

The SEU aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of economic data, trends and outlook, and sets out a series of recommendations to stimulate reform, growth and improved fiscal performance. This report comes after the country faced its worst drought in decades. Somalia’s economy grew by an estimated 2.3 percent in 2017, down from 4.4 percent in 2016, reflecting the impact of enormous losses seen in livestock and crop production and exports. The volume of live animal exports—Somalia’s largest export, accounting for more than 70 percent of export earnings—declined by 75 percent, from 5.3 million animals in 2015 to 1.3 million in 2017.

Somalia’s economy has grown modestly in recent years, and it remains vulnerable to recurrent shocks. Between 2013 and 2017, real annual GDP growth averaged 2.5 percent. Nonetheless, growth has not been sufficient to translate into poverty reduction. “To achieve higher growth, Somalia requires an acceleration of structural reforms,” said John Randa, Senior Economist at the World Bank Macroeconomic, Trade and Investment Global Practice and Lead Author of the SEU. “Somalia needs to continue to build the fiscal buffers to allow greater public investment in basic services. Recent efforts to broaden the tax base, enhance compliance, and reduce wasteful expenditures are starting to pay off.”

The GDP estimate was revised upward in 2017, based on new information and data harmonization with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The new estimate puts GDP at $6.8 billion in 2016 and $7 billion in 2017. GDP is dominated by private household consumption expenditure, which represents 132 percent of national income, followed by imports (62 percent), exports (15 percent), and gross capital formation (9 percent).

Special Focus: Mobile Money

The special focus of the report is on mobile money. Despite its fragility and underdeveloped financial institutions, Somalia has one of the most active mobile money markets in the world, outpacing most other countries in Africa. Approximately 155 million transactions, worth $2.7 billion, are recorded per month. Mobile money has superseded the use of cash in Somalia, with over 70 percent of adult Somalis using mobile money services regularly. This presents exciting opportunities for the country. “Private sector actors have given Somalia a unique opportunity to leapfrog towards widespread financial inclusion. We will continue to support the partnership between the Central Bank of Somalia, the National Communications Authority and the key private sector actors as they deliberate on an appropriate regulatory framework for the sector.” said Tim Kelly, Lead ICT policy specialist at the World Bank.

Nevertheless, the mobile money sector lacks robust consumer protection, and know-your-customer requirements. The mass adoption of services – while impressive – presents opportunities for promoting financial broadening and deepening that will lead to more competition and contestability in the financial services market.

The challenge for policymakers and regulators is to how to mitigate system vulnerabilities and avoid macroeconomic effects in the event of service disruptions. “Reducing costs and promoting greater stability is a top priority for the overall development agenda for the financial sector, ensuring that regulation does not stifle innovation by leveling the playing field is a very close second. There is a need to improve the balance between cooperation and competition between banks, MNOs and other non-bank financial institutions and ensure better integration of mobile money within the broader financial system. This is key to deepening and broadening the financial services market in Somalia for inclusive growth.” said Thilasoni Benjamin Musuku, Senior Financial Sector Specialist at the World Bank Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice and co-Lead Author of the SEU.

The SEU was prepared in close partnership with Somali stakeholders and aims to contribute to government policy-making and the regulatory environment in Somalia. This is the third in the SEU series for Somalia. The SEU series is financed by the World Bank’s Multi-Partner Fund (MPF).

WITH vast amounts of aid flowing into government coffers and its strategic position boasting one of the busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti ought to be among the wealthiest countries in the African continent.

However, the irony is that the tiny country situated in the eastern coast of Africa is among the poorest, characterised by a crippling sewage crisis that has led to an eruption of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis emanating from shocking levels of poor sanitation in the country of about 1 million people.

In rural areas, three out of four people have no access to toilets and relieve themselves in the bush.

In the capital Djibouti City, home to half the country’s population, a quarter of the population has no access to toilet facilities.

With the Horn of Africa a dry zone and with only 20 centimeters or less than 10 inches of rain a year, water is at premium in Djibouti.

Villages often rely on one or two wells, many of which are now contaminated with bacteria linked to human waste.

The 26,300 refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen, have added to the problem.

However, Radwan Bahdon, the government’s Director of Sanitation, said the situation was under control.

A new sanitation plant funded by the European Union (EU) is functioning, he added.

“Until 2014, wastewater was discharged into the sea without treatment,” Bahdon said.

lay the blame on the administration of President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, in office since 1999 after succeeding his uncle- Hassan Gouled Aptidon- who ruled since independence from France in 1977.

Guelleh, whose government is accused of human rights violations, retained power with 90 percent of the vote in February this year.

Vast amounts of aid have flowed into the Treasury over the years but the country has little, if any, to show for it.

Critics accuse Guelleh and his family as well as closest advisors of having significant clout in the economy.

Despite the grinding poverty afflicting the majority, Guelleh recently flew to China in a presidential jet.

Economists warn that Djibouti’s debt is close to its entire GDP but Mr Guelleh has shown no sign of slowing down on the opulence.

“In Djibouti, we are confronted by a family dynasty built on the suffering of our less than 1 million people,” opposition leader, Daher Farah, said of the impoverished country.

Despite its tiny size as the eighth-smallest country in Africa, at 23,200 km2, it is influential.

It has the United States’ only permanent military base in Africa, located at the Fort Lemonier, not far from the presidential palace.

France has its largest unit of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti.

Last year, China opened its first overseas military base-in Djibouti- with room for more troops that the US and France missions combined.

Regarding trade, Djibouti lies on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. It is the only route between the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal, a waypoint between Africa, India and the Middle East.

Loans from China have financed the building of a new railway to Ethiopia and cranes hovering over the port and city.

The government earns millions from passing ships.

However, earlier this year, Guelleh signed a decree stripping Dubai firm, DP World, of its 50-year contract to manage the container port.

When a London Court of Arbitration ruled in favour of DP World, government issued a statement it would not recognise the verdict.

The defiance raised fears whether Guelleh could use a similar decree to take back Fort Lemonier.

Environmental groups also called upon Southeast Asian countries to join the effort in order to keep the region safe from climate change‘s threats.

Coal-fired power plants are the most polluting way to produce electricity, and burning coal is the most prominent contributor to climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 7 million people die every year due to air pollution, which is mainly caused by “the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants.”

However, according to the report by ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE), in Southeast Asia, coal is projected to rise from 47 gigawatts (GW) in 2013 to 261 GW in 2035, which means each country is moving in the opposite direction to construct more coal-fired power plants.

Cambodia is one example. As a least developed country, it becomes even more reliant on coal-fired power, deeming it as the key factor to bringing an end to energy shortage in the future amid rapid economic growth.

According to Cambodian National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, the Royal government of Cambodia has committed to an ambitious goal of achieving nationwide electrification by 2020, providing all villages across the country access to electricity.

“ The lack of regulation for the emission standards could seriously impact the future environment and also the livelihood of the people. Han Phounmin, energy economist, Economic Research Institute for Asean and East Asia

In 2017, Cambodia consumed up to 8.15 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, with 30 per cent of it from fossil fuels. While energy consumption hikes, the government now considers hydropower and coal power plants as the most preferred and reliable sources of energy for the country’s sustainable future.

According to Ministry of Mine and Energy, Cambodia currently has three coal-fired power plants being commissioned—two of which are located in coastal province of Sihanouk with total capacity of 655 megawatts (MW)—with 250-MW coal station sponsored by Cambodian Energy Limited, and 405-MW coal station funded by Cambodia International Investment Development Group (CCIDG). Another one is 10-MW unit located in Dey Eth commune, Kandal province.

The Ministry’s spokesman Victor Jona said as Cambodia is diversifying sources of energy, it deems coal and hydropower as the most reliable and affordable sources of power in the future.

“We already approved the construction of two more 350-MW coal-fired power plants in Sihanouk Province, and the building will begin in 2019 and be expected to be completed in 2023 and 2024 respectively,” Jona said.

Coal power is cheap for now, but local Cambodians might pay the price in the future

The energy economist for The Economic Research Institute for Asean and East Asia (ERIA), Dr. Han Phounmin, acknowledges that the existing coal-fired power plants and future constructions can pose greater harm to the environment and the people’s health due to air pollution if the government is unable to ensure the removal of two main pollutants from coal power plants’ emission such as Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Sulphur oxides (SOx).

“Cambodia is pushing for a bigger share of power from coal-fired power plants, and of course it is a big concern for negative environmental impacts if the current coal power plants and the future fleets do not address the issue of removing NOx and SOx pollutants,” Phoumin said.

SOx can also cause acid rain, which is harmful to ecosystems, and reacts with other compounds in the atmosphere to form fine particles that reduce visibility, literally known as haze, he said.

Phounmin added that coal-fired power plants having small capacities like those being operated in Cambodia are mostly not equipped with ultra-supercritical technology, which can ensure lower emissions.

“Most of the coal power plants with installed capacity of less than 400 MW generally do not use ultra-supercritical technology for high efficiency and low emissions. Thus, the Cambodian authority will need to set up environmental standards for emissions and strictly monitor implementation. The lack of regulation for the emission standards could seriously impact the future environment and also the livelihood of the people,” Phoumin argued.

Nonetheless, Jona disputed that the government and relevant ministries have been putting efforts to minimise the impacts by keeping the emissions as low as possible. He said the government strictly adheres to the Environment Ministry’ emissions standard and the World Bank’s guidelines. However, he acknowledged that there is no development with zero environmental cost.

The Cambodian government has tried to look into new technology to lessen the environmental impact of coal energy generation. Last year, the Ministry of Mines and Energy also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with General Electric on implementing a Continuous Emission Monitoring System, a system that enables the Cambodian government to monitor and analyse emissions from all power plants in Cambodia.

Phoumin explained, however, that even though high technology has been introduced in coal power plants across the world, it doesn’t guarantee zero impacts on the environment. It can only lower the emissions. Local people still have to bear the serious health impacts.

Sar Mory, environmentalist and co-founder of non-profit Cambodian Youth Network, believes that when taking into consideration the environmental costs including waste and emissions, building more coal-fired power stations to cope with energy demand is not a smart choice.

Mory called on the government to comprehensively and carefully study which power plants are run to meet electricity demand and be more transparent on the energy demand while keeping public health a priority.

“As I am a citizen, I want the government to disclose specific and comprehensive reports on future energy demand. We should know how much our people need and how much the government needs to supply to industries and companies in the next five or ten years. This is to make sure if we really need to expand coal-fired power plants or we can have better alternatives for power generations,” he said.

169,https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/many-people-ghana-go-blind-glaucoma-because-they-have-no-access-treatment,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",D+C Development and Cooperation,Many people in Ghana go blind from glaucoma because they have no access to treatment,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 4.5 million people worldwide are blind because of primary glaucoma, an eye disease. In Ghana, some 700,000 people are affected. The situation is especially grim because there are fewer than 50 ophthalmologists in the country and because many people cannot afford the surgical intervention needed.

“I was diagnosed with glaucoma four or five month ago,” Issah Salamatu, a patient at the eye clinic of the Tamale teaching hospital says. She has tunnel vision and can only see what she is looking at directly, but nothing on the sides.

The 58-year old woman is one of 700,000 persons suffering the condition, according to the Glaucoma Association of Ghana. Almost three percent of Ghanaians are affected by glaucoma, and that is one of the highest rates internationally, the organisations reports.

Dr Gilbert Batieka Bonsaana has been offering free screenings to detect glaucoma since 2015. He is an ophthalmologist at the hospital in Tamale. Up to 70 people visit the eye clinic every day.

Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form. The loss of vision is slow, beginning with the peripheral or side vision, and often goes undetected for a long time. The only way to know for sure is to get tested at an eye clinic. “Vision lost cannot be regained, and glaucoma can cause blindness if it is left untreated,” says Dr Bonsaana.

Despite the high number of patients in Ghana, awareness is low. Mohammed Jamal, a resident of Tamale, says that he never had an eye check-up, “because I have never experienced any difference in my sight.” But glaucoma has virtually no symptoms and it usually doesn’t hurt if your eye pressure increases.

Adongo Isaac lost his sight due to glaucoma more than a decade ago – and he lost his job as well. “It is a terrible thing for me. I was a driver, but I contracted glaucoma and got blind,” he recounts. Now he is weaving doormats to make a living.

Stigma is another problem. Patients need support from family and friends. They tend to be shunned, however, because people think that the patients are cursed.



Adamu Ama is a patient who had developed glaucoma in her right eye. After a successful cataract surgery for pupillary block glaucoma, she is now doing well. Not everyone who needs surgery gets it, however. There are too few competent eye doctors in Ghana, and many people cannot afford the costs.

The late former United Nations Secretary-General Koffi Annan played football. Yes. Not only did he play but ‘played on the right wing’, as revealed by a Ghanaian news outlet.

Annan was an avid supporter of the world’s most popular game and during his time in the UN, he created an admirable relationship with the world football governing body FIFA.

2010 was the year when Annan called on the International Community to increase its efforts to use sport as a tool to fight poverty, heal divisions and protecting the planet. Speaking in Dubai at the SportAccord International Convention, he recognised the remarkable efforts being made around the world to use sport as a ‘positive force’ and urged for increased partnership between the sporting community, civil societies, private sector and development agencies.

He also highlighted the importance the FIFA World Cup brought to Africa in that year saying the tournament would increase support and investment from foreigners.

“Just as sport helps undermine myths and prejudices for individuals and groups, I believe this summer will have the same impact on a continent-wide scale. A highly successful tournament will help alter perceptions and play its part in increasing investment and support. It will underline the rich talent and potential there is in Africa not just in football but in every area if the right framework is put in place,” said the former Secretary General.

Annan was passionate about football. In 2005, during the launch of the International Year of Sport and Physical Education at the UN, Annan underscored the importance of sport in bringing people together, teaching teamwork and tolerance as well as fostering peace among countries.

“Sport is a universal language. At its best it can bring people together, no matter what their origin, background, religious beliefs or economic status. And when young people participate in sports or have access to physical education, they can experience real exhilaration even as they learn the ideals of teamwork and tolerance. That is why the United Nations is turning more and more to the world of sport for help in our work for peace and our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals,” said Annan as seen by GameYetu on the UN website.

171,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/enabling-the-youth-create-safe-spaces,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Himalayan Times,Enabling the youth: Create safe spaces,"Development of a country depends on how productive and creative its young population is and how much importance the government accords to its youth. By creating safe spaces, the youth get an opportunity to share and discuss ideas and make informed opinion

The government’s slogan of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” sounds quite mellifluous. But whether this dream can be materialised largely depends on how much importance the state accords to the youth.

Nepal has an immense potential to reap its demographic dividend, for youths account for 40.3 per cent of the total population of the country. Hence the country’s overall development largely hinges on how the government addresses the needs and interests of the young population.

There seems to be some sort of insecurity among the youths in Nepal. Thousands of young people are leaving the country today to work and study in foreign countries. In terms of working population, statistics say around 1,500 young Nepalis—men and women—leave the country, especially for the Gulf nations and Malaysia, in search of employment. This clearly shows unemployment is a major problem in the country.

Hence, one of the greatest challenges for today’s government is to find a way to retain the youths within the country. The only way to keep our young people in the country is creating employment opportunities for them.

The skills and strength of the youth with different views, faiths and ethnic backgrounds must be duly recognised so that they can be engaged in development activities.

With political stability achieved after a long gap, the country now aims to embark on the path of rapid economic development. But it will remain a pipe dream unless the youth population is engaged in activities that contribute to economic development.

When we have our youth population in the country, there arises the need of safe spaces for them. Safe spaces provide the youths with a platform where they can discuss and share ideas, express their views freely and form informed opinions.

With youths a country may achieve economic development but to ensure sustainable development, they must be given safe spaces. In this context, there is a need of youth policy in the country which sets the guiding principles for creating safe spaces for youths, particularly for those from the excluded groups, so as to ensure that they can talk and implement their education, skills and innovation.

Safe spaces are vital for providing an opportunity for youths from diverse backgrounds to come together to contribute. Under the coordination of youth organisations, various programmes can be implemented to develop the personality and leadership of youths.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 aim to make a better place to live in. The Sustainable Development Goals put inclusive growth at the core. The major goals of SDGs are eradicating poverty, inequality and social exclusion in a sustainable manner.

It is also a major requirement to make safe public green open spaces which should be accessible for all people including women, children, elderly and differently-abled people. The United Nations’ New Urban Agenda also has set a new global standard for sustainable urban development to promote equity, welfare and shared prosperity. In Nepal, it is necessary to mobilise small rural communities and villages for social and economic growth.

After the devastating earthquake in 2015, we are still in the resettlement and rebuilding process. So the collective force of youth is needed to drive the New Urban Agenda forward.

Globally, SDGs have clearly laid out a policy of encouraging youths and providing them equitable share in the development process. The United Nation’s Youth Framework lays emphasis on physical, psychological and cognitive development of the youth. In the present situation, the main priority of the government should be protection and promotion of migrant youths as well as enhancing the young people’s skills. Policymakers of Nepal hence must work to establish safe spaces for youths to facilitate the SDGs’ procession.

Development of any country depends on how productive and creative its youth population is. The present role of youths is as the passive recipients, but they should be prioritised as an active agent of development. The government needs to empower the youths to exploit their full potential in right places for the overall development of the country.

The challenges for youths central to economic development are varied according to gender, ethnicity, education level, religion and geography. The role of the youth is more consequential and functional for every nation building. In every nation historical changes have been made due to the active involvement of youths.

In the history of Nepal, youth participation in every political and economic movement cannot be ignored. Youths are conductor of social change; they are the future of the country. Therefore the government needs to address youths’ concerns through policy and programmes.

Youths can play a vital role in eliminating poverty and reducing inequality and to ensure that everyone benefits from development and no one is left behind, it is imperative that they be provided with safe spaces. Empowering youths means empowering the nation.

172,https://thewire.in/agriculture/launched-with-fanfare-this-cow-shelter-is-of-no-help-to-bundeli-farmers,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Wire,"Launched With Fanfare, This Cow Shelter Is of No Help to Bundeli Farmers","In a bid to protect gau mata, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath announced late last year that his government would set up gaushalas (cow shelters) in each of the 75 districts across the state. This move came as a result of the widespread nuisance caused by stray cows in the state, which was also one of the main focus points of the BJP’s election campaign in UP. The situation reaches catastrophic proportions in the dry Bundelkhand area – an area facing extreme poverty and starved of development – due to the practice of “anna pratha” that is typical to the area.

﻿

Anna pratha is a ritual of sorts, referring to the act of farmers and others abandoning their cows when they stop producing milk, either because they are unable to grow enough to feed them or at the beginning of the summer season, when there is a scarcity of water. These abandoned cows then run amok, damaging the crops and fields that are in their way. Many are of the opinion that the situation has worsened ever since the cow’s elevated status was further strengthened by the BJP regime. While buffaloes, because of their utility value, were usually not abandoned and were slaughtered for beef. But certain developments have seen that even buffaloes are being abandoned, in effect, increasing the havoc inherent to the anna pratha.

As per the locals, there are more than 50,000 stray cows in the Bundelkhand region alone. Most of the farmers in Bundelkhand hence have been eating, sleeping and practically living on their fields guarding their crop 24×7. They spend their time ranting amongst each other about CM’s announcements, such as the recent one that declared anyone found being cruel to cows (leave aside killing them) would be put behind bars – these only add to their woes, they insist. Impoverished Bundeli farmers have even committed suicide due to the deep debt they find themselves in after losing all their crop to the mayhem of stray cows.

Cow shelter raised hopes of farmers

In such a scenario, the hullabaloo that has arisen over the last month around the establishment of a cow shelter in Chitrakoot district’s Mau block, is quite understandable. Finally, stray cattle can be restricted and taken care of by the government, leaving the farmers’ fields un-trampled.

The move was hence welcomed by the locals. Inaugurated with great pomp and show on September 19, the event featured local Mau-Manikpur MLA, R.K. Patel. Patel threw some light on the details of the project, “The state government has ordered for these gaushalas to be built in almost each block of every district so as to provide a home to stray cows and provide for their proper rearing. Each district is being allocated a particular sum of money – our district has been given around Rs 1.5 crore, for instance. Every shelter is going to be equipped with sheds, drinking water facilities, and a space for storing hay. We are spending Rs 30-32 lakh in setting up this particular shelter itself.”

But the initial excitement died down soon enough, when the locals came to realise one huge, gaping flaw in the plan – the gaushala had no boundary walls! What’s more, the villagers soon discovered that the boundary wall was never a part of the budget at all. One of the locals, Ramesh Mishra, said, “Apparently, they are not making the boundary because it was never accounted for in the budget allocation. But it makes no sense without it. The cows will still be wreaking havoc everywhere.” While the farmers have been left to their own devices to deal with these cruel ground realities, the state government, it is alleged, has been making grand plans of turning cow urine and cow dung into flourishing industrial products – plans in which the gaushalas feature prominently.

The villagers’ disgruntlement has forced the local administration to take cognizance of the issue, even if momentarily. “We are now realising the technical problem of having an animal shelter with no boundary wall,” said Patel, with no hint of irony in his demeanour or tone. “All the facilities we plan on providing will be in vain if all the animals run away. Therefore, we have ordered for the work on the facilities to be ceased till a proper boundary is made. We have petitioned the district magistrate (DM) to get a boundary wall constructed at the earliest.”

Meanwhile, Deepak, a Mau local, voices another concern that not many seem to have realised in the din around the boundary wall – the size and capacity of the animal shelter. “Our own village has so many stray animals – at least 400-500 of them. And the stray cows from four to five neighbouring villages are also expected to be rounded up and kept in this shelter. But it can only house maximum 700 animals at a time,” he says, asking, “How will all the animals even fit?”

Evidently, this has not been part of the plan either. The MLA and MP from Mau have scheduled appointments to meet with the DM, primarily to discuss the issue of the boundary wall in the following week – a story we will follow-up.

Meanwhile, the farmers of Mau will be spending more sleepless nights, alert on sentry duty in their fields.

The SANDF commented after Amnesty International released a statement urging countries around the world to support the negotiation of a new law that would ban autonomous weapons systems otherwise known as “killer robots”.

This week, experts are meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, at the Convention on Conventional Weapons Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems.

The meeting will look at human rights and ethical issues around autonomous weapons that could set the grounds for future arms races.

Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobhozi, SANDF spokesperson, said the problem with the use of such weapons was that they would not be able to read situations which happened on the battlefield.

“Robots will never take the function of a soldier being a soldier,” he said.

Mgobhozi said human soldiers would be able to see humans and their nuances, and were capable of detecting when people were surrendering, which was not guaranteed with robots.

Another key factor, he said, was that soldiers would have ubuntu when dealing with people, which ­robots would not have.

The SANDF is involved in numerous peace-keeping operations on the continent.

Science fiction

Rasha Abdul Rahim, a re-searcher on artificial intelligence and human rights at Amnesty International, said killer robots were no longer the stuff of science fiction.

“From AI drones to automated guns that can choose their own targets, technological advances in weaponry are far outpacing international law.

“We are sliding towards a future where humans could be erased from decision-making around use of force,” she said.

Rahim said it was not too late to change course and that a ban on fully autonomous weapons could prevent a future arms race.

“So far, the likelihood that autonomous weapons will be used in police operations, with all the risks that entails, has been largely overlooked. But drones capable of shooting electric-shock darts, tear gas and pepperballs already exist.

“The use of fully autonomous weapons in law enforcement without effective and meaningful human control would be incompatible with international human rights law, and could lead to unlawful killings, injuries and other violations of human rights,” she said.

Last year, a UN panel of government experts concluded that international humanitarian law still applied to autonomous weapons, and called for more discussion on the matter.

Amnesty International pointed out that countries like France, Russia and the UK were opposed to creating legally binding prohibitions.

On the local front, Coral Vinsen from Amnesty International in Durban said the use of these robots could cause many problems in South Africa.

She said they could be exploited by criminals or even politicians who wanted to get rid of rivals.

With protests a daily occurrence in South Africa, the use of robots would be dangerous as situations constantly change.

Dr Johan Burger, a policing expert, said it was unlikely that they would replace police officers in places like protests.

On Friday, Sony and Insomniac Games released their feverishly anticipated Marvel’s Spider-Man, the latest video game adventure featuring everyone’s favorite wall crawler, exclusively for the Playstation 4 (PS4). Upon release the game was met with resounding critical and commercial success, garnering adoration from critics and players alike while also setting international PS4 sales records. The game has been heralded as one of the best superhero games to date, and an exceptional love letter to Spider-Man fans.

However, for a vocal minority, enjoying the bevy of unlockable costumes and swinging through the streets of New York City from web lines seem to take second place to accusing the game of promoting authoritarianism and taking swings at the game’s neutral-to-positive portrayal of the New York Police Department.

The first article to be written concerning this supposed controversy was written for Deadspin (bizarrely enough), a sports news blog, by the websites Managing Editor, Tom Ley. The article, titled “They Turned Spider-Man Into A Damn Cop And It Sucks”, makes its claims based on the opinions and emotions of the author and his negative opinions of general law enforcement, rather than any inherent agenda by the game’s creators:

“[S]o far the primary objective boils down to Help The Cops. Not just any cops, either, but the NYPD specifically, because the game takes place in a true-to-life rendering of New York City. It’s dumb to expect video games to be responsible reflections of real life, but it is also impossible, for me at least, to not feel some ickiness about the game forcing me into cahoots with even a fictionalized version of the NYPD, an organization that routinely oppresses some of the most vulnerable residents of the city I live in.” -Tom Ley, Deadspin, 10 September 2018

Unfortunately, Ley was not alone in his opinions, as numerous articles soon began to be published, all pushing forth the idea that Spider-Man is now an authoritarian crony, attacking and victimizing those who cannot defend themselves. While reading said articles, one imagines that these writers may have had a similar experience to Ley, who boasts in his second paragraph,

“Granted, I am only a few hours into the game” -Tom Ley, Deadspin, 10 September 2018

How can anyone who only plays a ‘few hours’ of any given game claim to know the entirety of what the game is about? At two hours, most players have barely begun to roam around the vast expanse of NYC’s skyline, much less discern all the themes and messages of a story. These writers have chosen to ignore most of the game’s presentation in favor of projecting their own issues and agendas upon Spider-Man.

A common complaint in these articles centers around Spider-Man’s use of Oscorp Industries surveillance towers.

Justin Charity in The Ringer writes:

“To reveal portions of the game’s map, players must bound across Manhattan and repair the dozens of surveillance towers that Oscorp Industries — a devious conglomerate — has installed to serve the NYPD. In fact, the towers resemble surveillance equipment that the NYPD now uses, in real life, to sort suspects and other people of interest by physical tags, including skin color, based on closed-circuit footage. Spider-Man does occasionally hint at the potential for civil rights abuses — it’s Oscorp technology, after all — but the game has rendered ubiquitous surveillance stations and drones as an otherwise benign, irresistible fact of modern life in a big, crime-ridden city.”

His sentiments would be echoed by Heather Alexandra in Kotaku:

“One of the earliest things you do in Spider-Man is go around activating security towers, made by Oscorp but used by the NYPD, that make it easier for Spider-Man to track crimes as they happen. Narratively, these towers allow the police to better surveil citizens; they also give Spider-Man access to police frequencies. They’re always listening, giving out calls to car chases and telling the player about break-in attempts that Spider-Man can thwart before the crime occurs. The uncritical use of these towers struck some players, especially those who live in New York, as odd. An NYU Game Center scholar took to Twitter to note similarities between these towers and the real world real NYC security cameras that IBM recently used to make skin-color profiling technology.”

In the game, Oscorp has installed a city wide surveillance system intended to assist the police in lowering the crime rate. Spider-Man can hack into the system’s many towers to unlock more sections of the world map and pinpoint collectibles and side missions (such as old high school backpacks Peter left webbed up, Fisk’s construction sites which are acting as money laundering fronts, or even the pigeon companions of one of Spidey’s homeless acquaintances).

Spider-Man at no point promotes their use, even stating to himself that the stations make him uncomfortable due to their potential for abuse and civil rights violations. Spider-Man is only taking advantage of a piece of technology his enemies have installed to better protect the people of New York City; he utilizes the towers not to boost the effectiveness of the police force or increase surveillance, but to be able to be a more attentive hero by receiving police radio broadcasts and 911 calls. To accuse the game of supporting this technology ignores its unique use as a seamless game mechanic used only by Spider-Man to save more lives and places unnecessary weight on the stance of a fictional character over the ever prevalent ‘Big Brother’ debate that is common in our technologically advancing times.

Another complaint found across these articles is the portrayal of the NYPD police force as something other than a militaristic, fascist army of storm troopers. Justin Charity opines:

“In general, the Marvel Cinematic Universe disgraces its fictional cops. Marvel’s television shows for Netflix — Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and The Defenders — often characterize the NYPD as a seedy reserve corps for any criminal mastermind seeking henchmen and moles. […] So Spider-Man can seem to be a late and overcorrective effort to repair Marvel’s regard for police. The NYPD is a beleaguered organization with a hyperactive PR department. Recently, the NYPD hired Spike Lee — a flamboyant critic of the department and civil rights advocate — to consult on advertisements. The NYPD didn’t pay Marvel for the courtesy of turning Spider-Man into Spider-Cop. Still, it is easy enough for the player to observe the advertisements for themselves: the helpful surveillance towers, the Spider-Cop routine, the hero cop memorialization. The character Spider-Man may flatter the NYPD, but the game Spider-Man presents a police force so extremely benign and uncontroversial, if only because it barely exists. The characterization isn’t subversive, exactly: The subtle slights are numerous, but they’re also, apparently, unintentional, produced by a skeptical subconscious forced to develop a dubious text.”

And once again Heather Alexandra offers a similar opinion:

“Police are an unimpeachable group in Spider-Man. They show no real flaws and make no mistakes. They don’t feel like an integrated part of the community; they pepper cutscenes and sometimes walk the streets but mostly show up as an allied faction in procedurally generated crime events. Even if Spider-Man’s New York is largely a fiction, it points towards a real place. New York is many things, but it is also the city of Eric Garner, stop-and-frisk, and Palantir. Rikers isn’t some fake pastiche location like Arkham Asylum. Real life police are a complicated presence in New York, but in Spider-Man they’re part of Spider-Man’s vigilante quest for justice, rather than members of the communities they’re supposed to protect.”

They are joined by Zack Kotzer of Dot eSports:

“The creative directors seem to love the NYPD more than most New Yorkers. Spider-Man regularly reiterates that he’d love to go by “Spider-Cop.” Plot threads revolve around the sacrifice of the NYPD and putting small time crooks in their place. Superhero stories as parallel to playground games of cops n’ robbers is old news. Superheroes, many of them, use their supernatural gifts or blessed wealth to reinforce the state. It’s a fascist undertone to many comic books that’s kept at bay by outrageous and menacing foes, with no resemblance to those persecuted in an out of whack prison state. But it’s still noticed. Usually by people with less baggage to comic books or those too deep in them.”

In the game, Spider-Man works closely with the NYPD, and to a more personal extent with Police Captain Yuri Watanabe. As you work in concert with Watanabe to trade information on Fisk, Osborn, and Spidey’s rogues gallery in the hopes of putting a stop to their criminal enterprises, there are also moments where Spider-Man will run across a random crime, such as a drug deal or a breaking and entering, where he will assist the cops in defeating and subduing a given criminal.

While it is no secret that the NYPD of our world has an extensive record of corruption and misconduct, most players are able to separate fiction from reality. They understand that not every piece of media needs to constantly hold a mirror to the real world and are able to enjoy the super hero experience offered by the game while still being aware that there are bad actors in the NYPD.

It is evident that these writers cannot fathom a world where a police officer isn’t an antagonist, and unfortunately this refusal to look at the world in a shade other than black and white is projected upon Spider-Man. These players see Spider-Man punching crooks, stopping terrorists, and taking down organized crime only to incorrectly assume that Spider-Man “aids in state surveillance, standing unquestioningly alongside an overly idealized caricature of the police”, when the reality is that Spider-Man is helping the people of New York, not the cops. At multiple times throughout the game, after stopping a crime, Spider-Man will remark that he needs to leave before the cops show up, as they don’t hold him in a positive regard, true to comic book fashion.

Conversely, as evidenced in the aforementioned quotes, these same articles also complain that the NYPD is almost non-existent. This however seems to ignore the fundamental concept of a video game: if the cops were stopping all the crime in NYC, what would be the point of having Spider-Man controllable throughout the city? In video games, immersion plays a very important factor, and if there are no crimes for Spider-Man to stop, the city and world would not feel believable (though it does seem odd that, in the same breath, these players condemn the game for both not showing the police as corrupt as they are and for not showing the police as active members of law enforcement). Yes, many cops still prevent and assist in the resolution of many crimes, but realistically law enforcement cannot stop every crime: to present a world where cops respond to and handle every single one of these crimes would make for a wholly unenjoyable and immersion-breaking video game experience.

There has also been a lot of focus put on the criminal element of this game, with some saying that his treatment of drug dealers and drug users border on fascism.

Zack Kotzer at Dot eSports explains:

“Diving in from storeys above to pummel drug pushers (and presumably drug users) feels like a petty and lunkheaded form of vigilante work for Spider-Man. A literalist War on Drugs manifestation, the type that felt dated and dangerous in the 80s and more tiresome now.”

Justin Charity adds his thoughts:

“The game subjects its criminal suspects to an equal but opposite simplification. On patrol, Spider-Man mocks the motivations and intelligence of every suspect he encounters. The game’s developers have rendered Manhattan in astoundingly faithful geographic detail, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block; but then the game disregards the social details that should inform criminal activity, such as local poverty or a neighborhood’s unique relationship with policing. The core story line further simplifies matters: In the game’s most chaotic mission, Spider-Man swings through Rikers Island to suppress an armed prison uprising. The game’s island is a hellscape, overrun with liberated meatheads who all relish the opportunity to pummel Spider-Man and the prison administrators to death.”

And Jeremy Gordon in The Outline puts his down:

“But one aspect of Spidey’s fictional crime-fighting sticks out nonetheless: The way he fights drug dealers. Here is how a typical encounter works in the game: You get a notification from the police scanner about a drug deal taking place in an alley or, confusingly, on top of a skyscraper. As you get closer, you hear the masked dealers spout villainous lines like, “You ain’t never seen anything like this stuff” and “scientists who cooked this up ain’t never heard of the Geneva Convention.” (I’m serious; I have the captions turned on.) Then, you kick their ass as Spider-Man quips away: “Drug deals and criminals go together like cookies and milk!” “Knocking the living stuffing out of drug dealers is my anti-drug!” “Fellas, you can’t keep ducking income tax like this!” You web them up, and leave before the cops show up. That’s as far as we go. Okay, sure, it’s just a video game, though the idea that video games should be stridently apolitical is a recent one, bolstered by the disingenuous Gamergate movement. It’s also inherently conservative, as it ignores the invisible connections between just about everything, and insists on the freedom to have personal fun without thinking about anything else.”

No, Insomniac Games did not forcefully inject real world political issues into Spider-Man, but neither have they turned Spider-Man into a Dredd-esque enforcer hell bent on savagely beating pot dealers. Through out the course of the game, Spider-Man gets alerted to drug deals taking place within his city. If the player chooses to investigate, upon their arrival, every participant present at the drug deal will attack Spider-Man, with anything ranging from their fists to fully loaded automatic rifles. These are not victims of addiction or people casually getting high; Spider-Man is essentially acting in self-defense while also attempting to remove violent criminals from the streets.

While the opioid crisis grows within the United States and the failed War on Drugs begins to be dismantled, Spider-Man’s drug dealers are designed by Insomniac Games to be markedly and explicitly ‘violent criminals.’ This also makes sense when considering the medium: in a game reliant on fast combat and travel, taking time out of a fight to check if someone shooting at you is down on their luck or in need of assistance breaks the flow of the game and jarringly breaks the immersion of a superhero fantasy. When faced with multiple guns being fired at him, one cannot blame Spider-Man for punching a few enemies and webbing another to a wall to save himself and prevent others from being harmed.

While reaching to connect Spider-Man with any given political hot button issue, the authors who purport these sentiments ignore almost completely the core of who Spider-Man, or more specifically Peter Parker, is as a character and what he stands for.

Tom Ley in Deadspin writes:

“What this new game does is put Spider-Man up on a perch where he doesn’t belong. He’s no longer performing heroic deeds out of just the goodness of his heart, but also for the purpose of solidifying the existing power structure’s grip on the city.”

Justin Charity in The Ringer echoes him:

“Peter Parker romanticizes policing, and so Spider-Man asks the player to humor the character’s law-and-order obsession through its narrative and gameplay.”

And Heather Alexandra at Kotaku provides an extensive description:

“Spider-Man’s portrayal of policing feels divorced from reality, to the point that it feels out of line with Spidey’s comic book heritage. Comics often speak to what’s happening in the real world. Captain America assumed the role of Nomad in 1974, the same year that Richard Nixon resigned from office in the wake of the Watergate Scandal. The X-Men have a history of allegorical representation of minoritized and persecuted groups. Spider-Man doesn’t seem interested in reacting to the real world.”

From his very first appearance in 1962 , the character of Spider-Man has always performed his super heroic duties in service of the ordinary citizens of New York. Whether he has had to give up his potential fame as a masked wrestler, refuse a pay check while a member of the New Avengers in favor of keeping his identity secret, destroyed his own international technology conglomerate, or simply paying for his own airfare to stop a crime in Europe, Peter has never desired any compensation or reward, whether it be money or “solidifying the existing power structure’s grip on the city.”

[LIGHT SPOILER FOR SPIDER-MAN (PS4)]

In fact, at a certain point in the game, Peter is rendered homeless thanks to his scientific funding being pulled and an eviction notice from his landlord. At no point does he stop being Spider-Man in order to demand someone pay his rent; every action Peter has ever had while clad in his webs has been to save another person or improve their lives. These baseless accusations would sound more natural coming from the game’s harshest Spider-critic (and Alex Jones Parody) J. Jonah Jameson, rather than a player who claims to be familiar with Spider-Man’s history.

[END LIGHT SPOILER FOR SPIDER-MAN (PS4)]

As for the aversion to Spider-Man’s “policing,” it should come as no surprise to players that Spider-Man has a history of going on ‘patrol,’ wherein Spider-Man spends his time wandering New York searching for any crimes in progress that he can stop or a person in need of assistance that he can help. It should come as even less of a surprise that this wandering is an integral part of Spider-Man’s gameplay. There’s no forced obsession with law-and-order in this game, but rather an accurate portrayal of Spider-Man’s nightly activities.

Furthermore, while Spider-Man has dealt with many serious issues throughout his 56 year publication run, and the game does touch upon certain issues (such as mass surveillance, government corruption, and pollution), it does not feel the need to force a political narrative or opinion upon the players. Heavy handedly forcing a political narrative into the game always leads to massive debates, division, and even locking a game’s relevance into a given year. By avoiding opinionated political grandstanding, Insomniac Games has ensured that as many people as possible will play their game and enjoy being Spider-Man, instead of dragging players out of their escapism and making them confront the stark truths of reality. Spider-Man’s latest outing is bringing together fans from across the world together instead of dividing them apart over political opinions in an all too volatile social atmosphere.

Spider-Man does not portray a hyper-realistic and intimate New York City Police Department, nor are there any elements that reflect the current political atmosphere of The United States, but ultimately there is nothing wrong with that. Insomniac Games and Sony never set out to write the next political thriller or create a triple-a title that explores racial dynamics within law enforcement, but they did set out to create an experience that allows players to suit up in their tights and leap headfirst off of skyscrapers. To this end, they have undoubtedly and impressively succeeded with Marvel’s Spider-Man.

It is not necessary for every piece of media to deal with real world problems or reflect upon political dynamics. It is supported, even encouraged, that people engage with things that make them happy, whether it be an amazing comic book run or a phenomenal video game. Thankfully, Spider-Man allows every player to escape into the world of Spider-Man, even if just for a moment. One can let the digital wind run through their hair as they backflip over a four story brownstone while forgetting about what troubles them, whether it be a personal issue or a non-troversey started by a disingenuous writer who only played a few hours of the game (and who, in the aftermath, has taken to twitter to deflect criticism about his article by mocking his critics).","The character Spider-Man may flatter the NYPD, but the game Spider-Man presents a police force so extremely benign and uncontroversial, if only because it barely exists.

176,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/89707/watch_is_there_no_solution_for_downandout_migrants_in_marsa,"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",MaltaToday,[WATCH] Is there no solution for down-and-out migrants in Marsa?,"Migrants in Marsa: Frans Debono and Ahmed Bugre

Nationalist Party (PN) leader Adrian Delia, during a Sunday speech claimed that the influx of foreigners is robbing Maltese nationals of their liberty, while also making older people feel scared in their own homes.

Delia insisted that the lack of a proper migration policy is eroding our values, while causing havoc with the Maltese identity.

In an interview with MaltaToday, Marsa mayor Francis Debono said that the migration issue should be tackled on a national scale.

“Immigration is Marsa’s biggest problem, but I also believe that it’s more of a national issue,” Marsa mayor Francis Debono said.

“The problem we have in my opinion is that we are blaming the lack of action done by the national authorities on the local council. There’s only so much we can do,” Debono said.

Foundation for Shelter and Support to Migrants director, Ahmed Bugre, somewhat disagreed with this statement. “In order for the community to solve the problem, it is vital to have everyone reaching out to each other,” Bugre said.

“The migrant community in Marsa is part of the Marsa community, therefore the council must look to find solutions. I do agree that it is a national problem, but the council can’t brush one’s shoulders to the situation,” Ahmed Bugre insisted.

Debono also said that the problems instigated by the minority are blamed on the majority, with those individuals who are causing all the trouble putting a bad label on those that don’t.

Asked if the Marsa stigma is merited, Debono claimed that one has to analyse where and from whom the stigma is coming.

“Who is creating the stigma? Do they have any political gain from the stigma created? I think one should see those factors first before asking if the stigma is merited or not,” he said.

Debono insisted that Marsa is part of a whole country, and therefore what is happening in Marsa can be seen all over Malta.

No, we don’t have a housing crisis. It is the responsibility of those sleeping in gardens and public spaces to stop doing so Francis Debono, Marsa mayor

“We need to stop giving localities a bad name, it’s happened in the past with the Cottonera region and is happening today with Marsa and Hamrun,” the mayor claimed.

On policing, Debono said that the increase of police personnel has helped to control illicit and irregular activities.

This contradicts a claim made by one of the locals interviewed by the newspaper, who said that police presence is only felt when a fight or some irregular activity hits the headlines, with the illegalities resuming when the issue dies down.

“After a week or two the number of police we see frequenting the area diminishes, and that’s when the illegalities return to their normal ways,” a woman frequenting the Marsa Band Club told the newspaper.

Debono said that regular policing also keeps the locals at ease, as according to him migrants don’t want to face law enforcement.

Bugre agreed that proper law-enforcement is essential, but claimed that it does not solve the problem.

“When we increase policing we only suppress the problem. What happens when you tell someone sleeping on the street to go away? He finds somewhere else like a public garden or another neighbouring area,”

Policing was evident when MaltaToday went to Marsa, with regular Rapid Intervention Unit patrol cars seen scouring the streets.

The only lack of police presence was seen inside the police station, with only one individual taking care of the night shift.

Asked whether this was the norm, the officer replied by saying that he was to be accompanied by another police officer who had called in sick but was not replaced.

When faced with the question of whether the police enforce loitering laws in Marsa, the police officer stationed for the night shift at the Marsa police station said no, despite the mayor’s claims of doing so.

“We only enforce drinking by-laws, no loitering laws are enforced by us,” the police officer said.

Faced with the police officer’s response, Debono said that it was irresponsible of him to state such things.

Debono said that the anti-loitering law was proposed by himself, in an effort to curb illegalities like prostitution and drugs.

The anti-loitering law was also pushed forward to prevent the illegal recruitment of migrant workers from the well-known Marsa roundabout according to the mayor.

Earlier this month, PN MEP candidate Dione Borg, published an online video blog talking about the migrant situation in Marsa, highlighting the fact that establishments that were run by Maltese nationals are now being run by migrants.

Asked to comment, Bugre said that the comment was deplorable.

“All I have to say is that it was a cheap way at trying to attract voters back. It wasn’t even a populist move and I won’t give that statement the dignity of answering it,” Bugre said.

In order for the community to solve the problem, it is vital to have everyone reaching out to each other Ahmed Bugre, Foundation for Shelter and Support for Migrants

“When migrants are not working they complain. When migrants are working they complain. What do the Maltese want? Do they want migrants to clean the streets only, or to work behind garbage trucks? It was just dirt.”

MaltaToday interviewed a migrant business owner, Pollo Lucky.

Lucky has been a business owner for the last five years, running a grocery shop and a bar in Marsa.

Queried about the situation in Marsa, Lucky said that he has always experienced a welcoming atmosphere from Marsa residents, expressing his disgust at other migrants for their lack of respect towards the community and the country.

“If you live in a country you must respect the law and lifestyle in it. I don’t like the way some of the others act, it gives me and migrants with good intentions a bad name that we don’t deserve,” he said.

Over the past few weeks, PN leader Adrian Delia took centre stage when he said that despite the government insisting that we are living in the best of times (l-aqwa zmien), we have migrants sleeping in cowsheds and in gardens.

Despite the countless accounts and photos of migrants sleeping in public places around Marsa, the mayor insisted that the locality doesn’t have a housing crisis.

“No, we don’t have a housing crisis. It is the responsibility of those sleeping in gardens and public spaces to stop doing so,” Francis Debono said.

Bugre laughed off this statement.

“Prices are hiking, wages are very low and people are forced to live in crowded conditions due to not being able to afford rent. It is one of the biggest problems that the migrant community is facing,” he said.

Bugre also claimed that a sizeable portion of migrants are opting for a life in prison, with individuals opting for imprisonment rather than sleeping outside.

“Breakfast, lunch, dinner and a bed are provided in prison. Some migrants are committing petty thefts just to get off the streets,” he said.

Debono said that migrants who sleep outside are undeterred when they are told to move by police officials, as they tend to go around from one locality to another until they find a spot where they aren’t bothered by anyone.

The solution to the Marsa problem according to Debono has to begin with the clamping down on over-crowding in privately owned apartments. The high density and lack of legal standards is an ever-growing problem in Marsa.

Debono also said that change is not easily accepted, and added that in a transitional period such as this, radical change is not easy to adapt to.

“In a locality which has an elderly population, different lifestyles and cultures are not easily accepted, but I believe that in due time with proper policies and appropriate regulation the problem will get solved,”

Ahmed Bugre’s solution lies in communities branching out to each other.

“We need to have stakeholders reaching out to each other. The solution lies in proper planning,” Bugre said.

He insisted that a proper dialogue must be ignited.

“The local council together with community workers, the Maltese community and the migrant community, must come together for a holistic and long-term plan.”

Bugre insists that if both the migrant community and the local Marsa residents do not feel threatened by each other, this would result in more integration.","“The migrant community in Marsa is part of the Marsa community, therefore the council must look to find solutions.
Asked if the Marsa stigma is merited, Debono claimed that one has to analyse where and from whom the stigma is coming.

The views expressed in this article are those of the writer and not necessarily those of Breaking Belize News.

By Richard Harrison:

BELIZE CITIZENS COMMITTEE

Draft Publication

Sep 1, 2018

I. WHY SAY NO TO ICJ AT THIS TIME?

1. Agreeing to go to court is giving legitimacy to a false claim. Belize should never be litigated, gambled, negotiated, sold nor gifted. Belize became independent in 1981 through the new world order after the second world war, vested in the United Nations Charter principle of SELF-DETERMINATION and its mandate for de-colonialization of states.

2. There is nothing to win and too much to lose for Belize, while Guatemala has nothing to lose and any small gain is another step towards their claim of entire Belize. If you pay one cent towards a million dollar claim, it is acknowledgement of entire claim.

3. The people feel generally unprepared in information, knowledge of risk/benefits, economy and governmental lack of integrity (trust) for such a major decision, the results of which are binding and no appeal is allowed. If we press pause now it does not stop us from going at a later date when the people feel better prepared. The people of Belize has seen so many “iron-clad, water-tight” cases lost in international courts by our government, losing many millions of dollars that has us on the brink of bankruptsy. When in doubt, say NO.

4. Guatemala and Belize committed to peaceful resolution of the dispute at the UN and OAS…and there is precedence of them requesting and getting modifications of timeframe and terms…so Belize can do the same with no threat of invasion or such violent actions and reactions.

5. If Guatemala wants us to join them at ICJ as equally interest goodwill parties…then they should not be occupying any part of Belize, including Sarstoon Island and the Belize side of Sarstoon River….nor promoting maps and other concepts that prejudice the judgment of the court.

6. No part of Belize should be put at risk of loss by a generation that grew tired, frustrated, apathetic, cynical, lazy, greedy, selfish, overly-ambitious, etc…which is why modification of our Constitution requires a minimum threshold of 75%…therefore the current zero threshold of the referendum is not consistent with the spirit of our Constitution, and the original 60% as per the original Special Agreement of 2008 is reasonable.

7. Belizeans are asking what is the significance and responsibility of the Head of State, and what exactly is state of UK-Belize relations? And why? Also what is the state of Belize relations with the Commonwealth? And do those relations have any security arrangements? And we want to see in black and white where Belize has kept the UK and HOS, and Commonwealth updated on related developments, as well as written request and responses for help, especially where Belize’s borders have been breached by unwanted foreign military.

8. Belize (and Guatemala) has much more pressing issues to deal with currently…like growing poverty, crime, drugs/gangs, corruption, etc, and we can engage each other in tackling those in a way that grows the respect and trust among our people, which is what ultimately will deliver lasting peace and prosperity.

9. Thanks to the international community for assisting, but such an important decision should be paid for in most part by Belize, from start to finish. We currently have commitments of financial support leading up to the referendum, but the most costly leg is after that to the time of ruling…for which we know not the cost…and for which we have no firm commitments of assistance to get the best home-run lawyers to bat for us.

10. The geo-political situation is not favorable to us. UK, Mexico, Israel, USA and Guatemala relations need lots of work. We must fix ourselves to mend those relations.

11. The ICJ is the final step of a process…that has seen our borders turn to adjacency line, adjacency zone, to giving up 9 miles of sea, to imaginary borders, to Sarstoon invasion to Guatemala policing our borders….progressive, step wise process of giving up sovereignty.

12. There is no such thing as an “iron-clad, water-tight” court case. Loss based on small technicalities are too often real, as Belize has experienced over past 10 years at CCJ, LCIA, US Courts.

13. The ICJ question is too broad, making the risk of loss too high…need revision to be more specific about claim…any and all of Belize is totally unacceptable.

14. To be sovereign, every piece must be as important as the other…one cannot be more important and decide for the other that it is expendable. We cannot cut off our nose to spite our face.

15. The argument that our generation must resolve the 150+ year-old dispute is flawed in many ways…not when the country is the weakest it has ever been…most corrupt, most broke, most unemployment, most insecurity, most against the super-powers, etc…this is certainly not the best time to take on this challenge.

16. If the Guatemalans were looking for an honorable way out, by losing through an international court, as is suggested in Assad Shoman’s book, they would not be so aggressive and pressing on all fronts, including seeking corporate support from such like Google and Al Jazeera….they would not be getting the best lawyers money can buy.

17. If there is a way, the referendum should be aborted if proven to be illegal and unconstitutional.

II. HOW TO SAY NO TO ICJ?

How we say something is as important as what we say.

Both our major political parties have been asking our allies for years, to assist Belize with taking the Anglo-Guatemalan dispute, turned Belize-Guatemala differendum, to the ICJ.

They made this decision among a few of the politico-economic elites…and did not consult widely with the people, nor sought their approval. Indeed, until recently when things became heated, most Belizeans were uninformed of the details of the process leading up to this ICJ referendum…and the vast majority are confused…on top of the apathy, cynicism and skepticism they have developed for all things political…and it is showing in the rather slow re-registration of voters…so the people of Belize have not given approval to any political leader to have signed any agreement that put at risk the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, and which is a basic requirement of the Belize Constitution, with a 75% majority.

Thus, Belize cannot go quietly to the referendum on April 10, 2019 and vote NO to ICJ…that could be interpreted by the international community…and especially our allies…that we gave them the middle finger…after them responding to our political leaders requests all these years.

Therefore, only the people in large numbers can say “No to ICJ, not at this time”….in the most respectable and honorable of ways…and this is why the recommendation for UNITY of 15,000 Belizean patriots in our nations capital Belmopan, on Independence Day, Sep 21 from 9am – 1pm…celebrating our self-determination, independence and sovereignty in grand style…instructing any and all political leaders that they must do nothing that cannot guarantee our sovereignty over all our territory…and to humbly request the international community and our allies…especially UK, Mexico, Israel, USA and Guatemala…to bear patience with us as we struggle to get past our very tender 37th year of Independence…committing, with respect and trust, to making the economic, judicial and political reforms necessary to accelerate our growth into an honorable and respectable member of the world community.

This celebration must show the best face of Belize…it must be humble yet vibrant…it must be beautiful yet substantive….it must be energetic yet orderly…it must be youthful yet wise…it must be simple yet creative…it must capture our unique diversity in unity.

Self-determination starts in the hearts and minds of the people…and it is more difficult for those who have the next meals and medicines to worry about…it is easier for those blessed with a little better economic situation…which is why we are asking for only 4% of our population…the ones that can afford to bring themselves, their families, workers and friends…those that can bring floats…from the most humble to the most elaborate….of all cultures…representing all industries and services of the private sector…culture, sports, education, civil society, government departments…unions, associations and institutions…bicycles, motorbikes, classic cars, horses…students, scouts, guides, environmental clubs, and everything about our youth….agricultural machinery and products display….architecture, engineering and construction machinery and products floats…food and beverage sales…entertainment and artists…the best of Belize!

III. WHAT TO DO AFTER WE SAY “NO TO ICJ AT THIS TIME”?

1. As a nation, the people and Government of Belize must re-affirm our commitment to uphold the Constitution of Belize. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition must emphasize this point in their speeches on Independence Day 2018…and the people must make and carry signs expressing this commitment.

2. A no to ICJ vote would be a vote of non-confidence in current leadership and both the leader of the ruling party and opposition should resign, and fresh elections should be called for Nov 4, 2019.

3. The aspirants for leadership then have 7 months to consult the people and present them with their best manifestos for national development…including economic, judicial and political reforms…forming these into a contract with the people…where all aspirants police each other to obey the electoral laws of Belize…with the law amended to increase significantly the penalties for breach of the electoral laws…with jail time for bribery.

4. We must give instructions to GOB to manage a foreign policy that does not make any enemies for Belize in the world…that must be respectable and trustworthy…so that we can be friends of both Israel and Palestine…China and Taiwan…without compromise to the rights and responsibilities of either. We must do all those things that reinforces the respect and trust of all countries…but especially the UK, USA and Mexico.

5. We must continue to engage the Government and people of Guatemala in deep and broad cooperation, collaboration, coordination, cohesion and even collusion…to build trust and respect among our people…in ways that bring tangible benefits to all our people…in education, culture, sports, health, environment, industry, trade, investments, governance, democracy, etc….supported by our allies in the same way as the ICJ process…and even more ambitious.

6. We can agree to hold simultaneous referendum in Belize and Guatemala every 20 years to allow the people to give review of performance of their respective governments in the execution of negotiated people-based contracts…and to give fresh instructions of how to proceed….guiding the peaceful growth of respect and trust between to independent and sovereign neighbours.

7. Belize and Guatemala must amend their citizenship and immigration laws so that the citizens of each country can legally move freely, and once they meet all requirements, choose to be Belizean or Guatemalan. Belize’s policies must protect the unique, peaceful, cosmopolitan co-existence of its people…and the population must be allowed to grow in a balanced way that does not allow any one race or culture to dominate in numbers or power over others.

8. Belize and Guatemala must survey the border again using current technology and clear the border, allocating budgets to maintain it clean, so that the people of both countries can respect it and have no excuse to trespass.

9. Belize must officially and publicly request assistance from the UK, EU, Mexico, USA and Israel with the negotiation of a security guarantee for Belize as part of a compact that Belize must conserve and sustainably develop all the protected areas using internationally accepted standards and best practices…so that Belize can turn all its security and safety material and human resources towards achieving optimal safety and security for the people of Belize…with capacity to lend a helping hand regionally in times of natural disasters.

10. The Guatemalan claim over Belize in their Constitution is a thing only they can decide to change…they will know when is the required timing and circumstances to strike it out. Belize must grow in self-determination…which is the basis upon which Independence was fought for and gained. We must educate from pre-school to university in our history…and develop our identity as ONE Belizean people…we must erase every notion of tribalism or balkanization of Belize…while respecting the rights and responsibilities of our indigenous Mayan people, as guaranteed in our Constitution.

11. Our Government must move immediately to develop a massive countersuit claim, just in case Guatemala decides to go to court with its claim outside of the “equally interested goodwill party” pact of the Special Agreement.

12. Our judicial reform must reaffirm our commitment to the spirit of the preamble of our Constitution…and all the rest of the Constitution, laws, bylaws and statutes must be made to align with the spirit of the preamble.

13. Our economic reforms must be Mixed Economy in philosophy, driven by competitiveness and productivity of the private and public sectors, observant of national food security, operating in standards acceptable in the developed world, with a lowest-rate, broadest-based tax system that allows to government to provide quality services and infrastructure that will permit rapid, sustainable macro-economic growth, with target unemployment below 6%, inflation below 1.5%, average interest rates of 6.25%. We must create the conditions necessary to engage our developed- country allies in debt-for-education and debt-for-nature swaps, as part of our debt rationalization plan to reduce nation debt consistently year-to-year until it is below 50% of GDP within 10- 15 years.

14. Our political reforms must give us separation of powers through an elected Senate, and a purely professional executive Cabinet, and elected representatives as legislators in the House of Representatives. It must tighten the conditions and circumstances under which ministerial discretion can be used, and significantly increase the penalties for breach. We must modernize electoral laws to increase democratic participation of the people, eliminating bribery in the electoral process. Modern campaign finance laws must be enacted. The Public Accounts Committee, the Auditor General offices, and Elections and Boundaries offices must be appropriately resourced, and laws governing their terms of reference, reward and punishment, updated to function efficiently and effectively on behalf of the people.

We Are All Winners,"Gambia Press Union (GPU) newly elected President has called on the members of the country’s press body to remain, making it very clear that there are no loosers or winners in the just concluded XI Triennial Congress.

Sheriff Bojang Jnr was speaking shortly after he was voted into office as he was flanked on both sides by seven other Executive members bestowed with the mandate of presiding over the destiny of media practitioners in the tiny West African nation.

From September 7-8, GPU delegates gathered at the Baha’i Center in Fajara for a post-Jammeh Congress.The two-day event brought together participants from various media outlets, and provided an opportunity for delegates to not only adopt a new Constitution but also to elect a new executive that would steer the affairs of the union for the next three years.

Bojang said GPU is there for everyone, and seized the opportunity to assure delegates that the new executive will not turn a deaf ear to suggestions, criticisms and all ideas geared towards moving the union to higher heights.

He expressed hope the new found unity will uplift the standard of journalism, and help improve the welfare of Gambian journalists.

“We have a huge task lying ahead. The past administration made a lot of achievements, and so many things to celebrate,” he added.”There is a lot work that remains to be done. Our job is to keep the hope of people alive.”

Asked about his plans to engage Gambia government over some draconian laws that are yet to be repealed, GPU President clearly stated that the new executive will not relent on these issues.

“We are not going to be complacent. We are going to fight,” he shouted out.

Over the past three years, GPU in tandem with its various partners were able to run projects that were funded to tune of 18, 259,402 dalasis. But the welfare of Gambian journalists continue to be a matter of serious concerns, leaving many journalists trapped into the culture of per diems.

Sheriff Bojang Jnr vowed to put the welfare of journalists at the centre of their work, saying they will spare no efforts to engage media chiefs on the issue.

Many voices warned the executive against turning GPU into an island of prosperity surrounded by an ocean of poverty.

Bojang promised to reverse this disturbing trend in making sure that transparency prevails when it comes to financial matters.

“The GPU I am going to preside will communicate every penny that comes in. We will have to improve greatly on communication,” he remarked.

Other members of the union include Mustapha K. Darboe (Vice-president), Mariatou Ngum Saidy (Treasurer), Pa Modou Faal, Mustapha Mbye, Fatou Sowe, Kebba Jephang and Sarjo Camara Signateh.

Saikou Jammeh continues to hold the position of GPU Secretary General.

179,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/health/uk-period-poverty-asequals-intl/index.html,"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,She had no sanitary pads. No one knew and no one helped,"London — Seven years ago, Rachel Krengel was a young mother with two small children. Facing a delay on welfare payments, she and her family were struggling to stay afloat.

""We fell into this awful spiral of poverty and debt,"" says Krengel. ""One of the things that fell by the wayside was my ability to buy enough menstrual products to get me through the month.""

Sitting in her living room in Croydon, south London, the 30-year-old feminist and political activist recalls how she kept the problem a secret out of shame and an ingrained belief that periods are taboo. She now campaigns to make sure women don't experience the same challenges.

""I never talked to anyone at the time,"" she says. ""I never told my partner that it was an issue.""

Period poverty -- where girls or women are unable to afford sufficient menstrual products -- is often seen as a problem confined to developing countries. In Tanzania, for example, many girls and women say basic pads are simply unaffordable.

But recent surveys in the UK have exposed startling rates of period poverty in one of the world's richest countries and sparked a national conversation.

With a contraceptive implant that made her bleed at least 25 days out of every 28, the problem was particularly acute for Krengel.

Krengel rationed her menstrual products, wearing a single sanitary pad for up to 20 hours (instead of the recommended three or four), inserting a contraceptive diaphragm to catch the blood or simply free bleeding (using nothing at all).

Throwing away her old jeans later, she noticed that ""all of them had this red stain running down the seam, because I would just be free bleeding at least two or three days every week.""

Like countless girls and women around the world who miss days of school or work every month because they can't access the products they need, Krengel found herself spending more time at home, worried about going out.

'The first thing under the bus'

At the time, Krengel, her partner and their two daughters -- one of whom was just a few months old -- were living in Norwich, a small city 100 miles northeast of London.

Switching between two different types of welfare, the family's housing benefit was paused and they were told to reapply. But there was a months-long backlog: ""We were left without any money to pay rent for a very long time,"" Krengel recalls.

They turned to high-interest payday loans and friends and family to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads.

When they had no money for food, Krengel's brother-in-law did an online grocery shop. When her two-year-old daughter had no winter coat, Krengel's sister went out and bought one.

But when she had no menstrual products, no one knew and so no one helped.

""Any time someone was offering to help us financially, I would say, 'go buy something for the kids.'""

And it was often a choice between spending £1 ($1.30) on a packet of sanitary pads or putting food on the table, she says.

""You can make dinner for four people for £1,"" she says. ""That seemed so much more important than something that was only for me.""

Menstrual products are ""the first thing that goes under the bus when you're poor.""

'Tip of the iceberg'

The research was triggered by media reports last March that some schoolgirls in Leeds, a city in northern England, were missing up to a week of school every month because they could not afford menstrual products. Others were regularly using tissue paper or socks instead of pads or tampons.

""We know of a few hundred cases (of girls unable to afford menstrual products),"" says Sharon White, head of the UK's School and Public Health Nurses Association. ""But that's the tip of the iceberg.""

And it's a problem that can impact women of any age. Many UK food banks now offer non-food items such as menstrual products and the demand for them is growing significantly, explains Alison Inglis-Jones, trustee and volunteer at the Trussell Trust, which runs more than 420 food banks across the country.

""I've seen people coming in using newspaper, tissues or socks,"" she says. ""One woman was taking paper out of a public library and using that.""

""If you can't afford food you can't afford sanitary protection,"" says Tina Leslie from Freedom4Girls, the charity that first flagged the issue among UK schoolgirls last year. ""The problem is the same here as it is in Kenya.""

And poverty is on the rise in many more developed countries, partly due to a decade of spending cuts.

Current trends show that the long-term policy of austerity in the UK, largely implemented by Conservative-led governments of the last eight years, has impacted women more significantly than men -- and women of menstruating age most of all.

According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission , many of them are mothers claiming child benefit and other forms of family welfare and therefore account for a big proportion of welfare payments -- that means they are hardest hit when payouts are cut.

But for many girls and women globally, financial poverty is compounded by the stigma around menstruation that leads women to ""hand off tampons to each other like we're doing a drug deal,"" as Krengel puts it.

""Two massively stigmatized experiences -- menstruation and poverty -- intersect to create this bizarre and horrible form of poverty,"" she says.

She, like many others, believes both must be addressed simultaneously to have any long-lasting impact.

Tackling the taboo

Since Plan International released their UK study, long-running campaigns tackling the issue have been picking up more interest than ever before -- and new ones have sprung up too.

A protest in central London last December was a watershed moment for those campaigns, marking the first time the issue hit mainstream headlines in the UK.

The rally outside Downing Street, the official residence of Prime Minister Theresa May, attracted celebrities including British models Daisy Lowe and Adwoa Aboah and hundreds of demonstrators, some sporting tampon jewelry and vagina-related paraphernalia.

Many protesters told CNN they were shocked to learn that period poverty was a UK problem.

""It's disgraceful that our society's even having this problem and disgraceful that we should feel ashamed for talking about it,"" 18-year-old Suzie Murray said at the rally.

Chella Quint, who runs a campaign called Period Positive, encouraging shame-free conversations about menstruation, has only recently freed herself from that psychological trap.

""There were times when I couldn't financially afford menstrual products and that was worrying, and there were other times when I couldn't socially and culturally afford it, because I was afraid to say anything,"" she says.

Not having loads of toys as a child ""didn't harm me forever I don't think,"" Quint explains. ""But the embodied shame around feeling negative about periods -- that definitely has.""

Rachel Krengel makes a similar point. ""I think there's a part of every menstruator on this planet who is still a 12-year-old who's just spotted blood on their crotch and is so desperately ashamed of that.""

'It's so easy to fix'

With so much attention currently focused on women's issues and gender inequality, Krengel believes now is the time to push for change.

She wants to see free provision of menstrual products in all UK schools. By her calculation it would cost £11 ($14) per child per year.

""It's so easy to fix,"" she says. ""It's a nothing amount of money.""

petition started by Krengel and other members of the London-based feminist activist group Fourth Wave is calling on British Prime Minister Theresa May to introduce free menstrual products in all UK schools. It has gathered more than 135,000 signatures to date.

Scotland is set to do just that. In August, the Scottish government set aside £5.2 million ($6.8 million) to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities across the country.

Wales has also set aside £1 million ($1.3 million) for a similar project.

The UK's Labour Party -- the largest opposition party -- has pledged to spend £10 million ($13 million) to provide free sanitary products in secondary schools, homeless shelters and food banks. Smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and the Women's Equality Party, have made similar pledges.

In a debate in the House of Commons in June, Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said there was ""no significant evidence"" that period poverty was having an impact on school attendance.

""For (the government) to do something about it now would mean an acknowledgement that child poverty has soared over the last seven years,"" Krengel says. ""It would be an admission of what austerity has done to our society.""

Along with free provision of pads or tampons, campaigners are calling for better education about periods in schools.

Krengel says that if these national conversations had been happening when she was struggling with period poverty in secret, it might have helped. She hopes people like her are feeling ""a bit less alone now.""

Krengel, who no longer experiences period poverty herself, says that if these national conversations had been happening when she was struggling in secret, it might have helped. She hopes people like her are feeling ""a bit less alone now.""

But while ""not feeling alone is great, it has limited usefulness,"" she says. ""What we need is some actual change. We need some action.""

Clarification: This story has been updated to better reflect that activist Rachel Krengel no longer experiences period poverty herself and has organized a petition calling for free menstrual products in all UK schools.","""One of the things that fell by the wayside was my ability to buy enough menstrual products to get me through the month.""

While the majority of fatalities were due to geophysical events, mostly earthquakes and tsunamis, 91% of all disasters were caused by floods, storms, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather events.

In 1998-2017 disaster-hit countries also reported direct economic losses valued at US$ 2,908 billion, of which climate-related disasters caused US$ 2,245 billion or 77% of the total. This is up from 68% (US$ 895 billion) of losses (US$ 1,313 billion) reported between 1978 and 1997. Overall, reported losses from extreme weather events rose by 151% between these two 20-year periods.

Such losses are only part of the story, since the majority of disaster reports to EM-DAT (63%) contains no economic data.

In absolute monetary terms, over the last 20-year, the USA (US$ 945 billion) and China (US$ 492 billion) recorded the biggest losses, reflecting high asset values as well as frequent events.

Absolute losses also mask the relatively greater burden of disasters on the poor. When economic costs are expressed as an average percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), this becomes clearer.

Figure (a) shows that only one high income territory ranked among the top 10 in terms of percentage of GDP losses over the past 20 years (Puerto Rico). Apart from upper-middle income Cuba, the other worst-hit nations were all lower income countries, led by Haiti.

In terms of occurrences, climate-related disasters dominate the picture over the past 20 years, accounting for 91% of all 7,255 recorded events between 1998 and 2017. Within this total, floods were the most frequent type of disaster, 43% of all recorded events.

In 1998-2017, storms (233,000 deaths), including tropical cyclones and hurricanes, were second only to earthquakes (747,234 deaths) in terms of fatalities. Storms were also by far the costliest type of disaster (b), with reported storm losses amounting to US$ 1,300 billion over the past 20 years, twice the reported losses for either flooding or earthquakes.

Fatalities from climate-related disasters also reflect vulnerabilities rather than being a crude function of the rising number of occurrences. Unlike earthquakes, populations vulnerable to extreme weather events are more evenly spread around the globe.","In 1998-2017 disaster-hit countries also reported direct economic losses valued at US$ 2,908 billion, of which climate-related disasters caused US$ 2,245 billion or 77% of the total.

181,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/no-way-of-knowing-progress-of-74-gender-related-sdgs-61940,"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Down To Earth Magazine,No way of knowing progress of 74% gender-related SDGs,"Data is available on only 26 per cent of 85 gender indicators, says the first review of the status of women and girls in the Asia Pacific

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, which, by definition, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, has 85 gender-related indicators. But, how many of them are measured? Data is available on just 26 per cent of these indicators in a scenario when prioritising gender equality can accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific, reveals a report released by Asian Development Bank and the UN Women. This is the first comprehensive review of the status of women and girls in the region.

The report also points at lack of regional data on 41 per cent of the indicators related to the goal that aims to achieve gender equality by empowering women and girls.

While this report identifies the data gaps and highlights the urgency to improve production and use of gender statistics, a new tool to measure gender equality across the issues covered in the UN SDGs-- SDG Gender Index—was released at the UN General Assembly a week ago. But, it will just track gender equality progress for six countries in the region, which include India and Indonesia.

While Asia and the Pacific has made progress in some aspects of gender equality, there are several areas where women and girls still face inequality. Women’s labour force participation rate has fallen from 56 per cent in 1990 to 49 per cent in 2013 in the region. In fact, this is the only region in the world where the gender gap in labour force participation is increasing, says the report.

Women also remain underrepresented in decision making and leadership roles with fewer 1 in 5 parliamentarians in Asia and the Pacific being women and in many cases, not even that.

This report has not included India, but the state of parliamentarians in the country paints a similar picture. In the 16th Lok Sabha, just 12 per cent of the total members are women (64 of 534). Representation of women in state assemblies is just 9 per cent, according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

Advancing women’s equality in the countries of Asia Pacific could add $4.5 trillion to their collective GDP annually in 2025, a 12 per cent increase over a business-as-usual GDP trajectory, estimated McKinsey in April 2018. In fact, this additional GDP would be equivalent to adding an economy with a combined size of Germany and Austria each year. The southeast Asian nations could boost their collective GDP by US $370 billion a year by 2025 if the existing inequity between the genders is eliminated.

While calling for significant investment to monitor gender equality in the SDGs, this report provides policy recommendations to assist countries to achieve gender equality by 2030. Because, clearly, it’s a way to great development and it’s about time that inequality is addressed.

182,https://jacobinmag.com/2018/10/nikki-haley-resignation-un-john-bolton-war,"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Jacobin magazine,Nikki Haley Was No Different,"It seems like every time a Trump administration official steps down or is threatened with being pushed out, the liberal establishment jumps to their defense.

Sean Spicer was the toast of the Emmys for making light of his angry, belligerent turn as Trump’s press secretary. Gary Cohn, the architect of what is probably the most radically regressive tax bill in modern history, transformed into a “moderate” and “steadying influence” after he resigned. Even 75 percent of Democrats inexplicably opposed Trump firing Jeff Sessions, an honest-to-God white supremacist whose guiding ambition appears to be turning into a character from a D. W. Griffiths movie.

Now we have Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the UN, who announced two days ago she would leave her post by the end of the year. The New York Times lamented it would leave the administration “with one less moderate voice.” “Nikki Haley will be missed,” wrote the newspaper’s editorial board, arguing she was leaving “with her dignity largely intact,” having played “constructive roles.”

Brookings visiting fellow Jeffrey Feltman, who served alongside Haley for some of his time in the UN, expressed concern that her successor would reject the “support for the UN” that she managed to maintain, arguing that national security advisor John Bolton doesn’t share her pragmatism. The Washington Post had similar concerns.

This is all peculiar, not least because Haley has been very clear about where she stands in regards to Bolton’s ultranationalist worldview. “I know his disdain for the UN. I share it,” she said of Bolton earlier this year. And sure enough, Haley has done everything in her power over the last twenty-two months to prove she meant it.

To be sure, the UN is an imperfect institution that is asymmetrically dominated by very select interests. But if you’re worried about the survival of the concept of multilateralism, let alone US “support for the UN,” there’s little reason to be nostalgic about Haley’s tenure. Haley’s very first act as UN ambassador was a belligerent speech where she threatened the world’s countries she would be “taking names” of those who didn’t adequately support the US.

Haley spent much of her tenure assailing the UN Human Rights Council, first as “corrupt,” later as “foolish,” before the Trump administration pulled the United States out of the council — an act Haley blamed on human rights groups that she accused of aligning themselves with Russia and China over the US. She led a forty-country walkout from nuclear weapons ban talks and questioned if the countries who supported the talks were really “looking out for their people.”

When the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights produced a searing report on US poverty heavily implicating Trump’s policies, Haley called it “misleading and politically motivated” and an example of the UN’s “misplaced priorities.”

In other words, Haley’s ambassadorship was devoted to the exact kind of trashing of multilateralism and undermining of the UN’s theoretical position as a vehicle for orderly global relations that makes John Bolton giddy at night. The US even withdrew from UNESCO, an inoffensive UN agency that mostly works to preserve cultural and historical sites and spread education and literacy, triggered by what Haley denounced as its “extreme politicization” after it declared the old city of Hebron a Palestinian heritage site. UNESCO was “an already highly questionable UN agency,” she charged.

The UNESCO pull-out was part of what was arguably Haley’s chief agenda as ambassador: fervently advancing Israeli government interests to lay the groundwork for a future presidential run.

While Haley frequently assailed the Human Rights Council for having human-rights violators as members, her real issue with it was that it was a “cesspool of political bias” against Israel. Haley complained that the council was “wrongly singling out Israel for criticism,” claiming that Israel was “a country with a strong human rights record.” She accused the council of “chronic anti-Israel bias.”

Early on, Haley announced her determination to “stand up to the UN’s anti-Israel bias,” name-checking Obama’s decision not to veto a UN resolution condemning illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. In her first year on the job, she claimed the Western Wall was “part of Israel” and urged that the US embassy move to Jerusalem, demanded the UN withdraw a report concluding Israel is an apartheid state, and repeatedly threatened countries against voting for a UN resolution condemning the embassy move, including by warning that the US would defund the UN if the resolution passed.

No pro-Israel action was too petty. When the UN secretary general nominated former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad — a former World Bank official disliked by Hamas — to be the UN envoy to Libya, Haley blocked it, reportedly without even consulting Israel, because of the “signal” it would send to the UN, as the US didn’t recognize a Palestinian state. For good measure, she then called the UN “unfairly biased in favour of the Palestinian Authority.”

The hijinks continued into this year. When the Palestinians put forward resolutions condemning the embassy move, Haley championed Trump’s decision to retaliate by withholding more than $100 million in Palestinian aid — aid that the US cut altogether in August and which five million refugees depend on for basic necessities.

After Israeli forces killed dozens and otherwise brutalized hundreds of Palestinian protesters in May, she told the UN Security Council that “no country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has,” and walked out of the room as a representative from the Palestinian Authority started speaking.

On the back of all this, Haley made a beeline for the annual AIPAC conference in both 2017 and this year, where she further bashed the UN, affirmed her commitment to Israel in front of thousands of future Republican donors, and made Sarah Palinesque comments about how she wears heels for kicking. It’s no wonder various Israeli officials and even the country’s army issued tributes to Haley upon news of her resignation.

Haley is well-liked by neocons and centrists for supposedly bucking the Trump administration in championing human rights. And Haley has indeed made a big show of taking countries to task over their human rights abuses.

It doesn’t take much effort to see through this posturing. When Haley originally listed the human rights violators who sit on the UN Human Rights Council, she conveniently left out Egypt, a US ally that has embarked on a campaign of repression since a 2013 coup, and that most recently tortured and raped a US national. At the same time, Haley has cozied up to India and its ultranationalist, repressive prime minister Narendra Modi.

Haley is such a fan of human rights, she threatened behind closed doors to end support for the UN’s peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in exchange for cuts to its scale, which she cheered. She later bragged about cutting $600 million from the annual UN peacekeeping budget, earning the US taxpayer a miniscule saving. She then made sure to visit traumatized victims for a photo-op in the very countries where she had forced a reduction in peacekeeping forces. In keeping with this, Haley has also proposed turning US aid to poor countries into leverage for “greater support at the UN and elsewhere,” particularly among countries that frequently vote against the US government.

Meanwhile, Haley has used her position to beat the usual war drums. She warned that military action against Syria was on the table. She threatened North Korea that it could be “destroyed” over its saber-rattling in 2017. And she did a lie-filled speech criticizing the Iran deal, while repeatedly touting dubious evidence that Iran has violated recent Security Council resolutions in the hope of spurring on more aggressive actions against the country, pointing to Iranian-made weaponry found in Yemen. This means Haley, who has been praised for criticizing Saudi Arabia over its repressive policies, has only ever mentioned the appalling Saudi war in Yemen to push for harsher measures against Iran.

One could make the case that in all these examples, Haley was simply acting under the orders of the Trump administration. Not so, according to Haley, who proudly describes herself as a “bull in a China shop” and bragged to CNN that she only took the job on the assurance that she could speak her mind. “I don’t go rogue on the President,” she explained. “He’s very aware of what I’m doing and he’s very supportive.”","Now we have Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the UN, who announced two days ago she would leave her post by the end of the year.
While Haley frequently assailed the Human Rights Council for having human-rights violators as members, her real issue with it was that it was a “cesspool of political bias” against Israel.

The small Himalayan state of Sikkim on India’s border with Tibet was declared fully organic in 2016 after phasing out chemical fertilisers and pesticides and substituting them with sustainable alternatives.

Sikkim’s experience shows that “100 percent organic is no longer a pipe dream but a reality,” said Maria-Helena Semedo, deputy director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which co-organizes the Future Policy Awards.

The awards have previously honored policies combating desertification, violence against women and girls, nuclear weapons and pollution of the oceans.

This year’s was for agroecology, which includes shunning chemicals, using crop residues as compost, planting trees on farms and rotating crops to improve the soil and protect against pests.

Proponents say agroecology could increase farmers’ earnings and make farms more resilient to climate change as erratic rainfall and extended dry periods hamper food production.

Tourism numbers in Sikkim rose by 50 percent between 2014 and 2017, according to the World Future Council, another co-organizer.

“Sikkim sets an excellent example of how other countries worldwide can successfully upscale agroecology,” said Alexandra Wandel, director of the World Future Council.

“We urgently need to shift to more sustainable food systems. Agroecology is absolutely vital to make our food systems sustainable and inclusive,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.

The second prize was split three ways, with Brazil honored for a policy of buying food for school meals from family farms; Denmark for a successful plan to get people buying more organic food, and Ecuador’s capital Quito for boosting urban gardening.

The prizes honor “exceptional policies adopted by political leaders who have decided to act, no longer accepting widespread hunger, poverty or environmental degradation,” added FAO’s Semedo.","Sikkim’s experience shows that “100 percent organic is no longer a pipe dream but a reality,” said Maria-Helena Semedo, deputy director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which co-organizes the Future Policy Awards.

And none of those addresses appeared on her tribal ID, which Ms. Vivier presented when she tried to vote in 2014. She was turned away by the poll worker, a woman she had known since she was 5 years old. Another voter was turned away by her own niece.

I wasn’t surprised to learn that addresses were being used as a tool for disenfranchisement. Governments have, intentionally or not, long excluded their most marginalized citizens from this crucial aspect of legal identity. There are still at least tens of millions of city dwellers around the world who don’t have an address.

Street names and house numbers weren’t inevitable; they were invented. Almost 250 years ago, for example, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria began to number the homes across her vast realm to enable mass conscription of men to fight her wars. As Anton Tantner of the University of Vienna has chronicled, more than a thousand officers fanned out across her empire, painting on each house a number in black paint made from oil and boiled bones, while recording who lived there on preprinted forms.

Violent protests broke out occasionally across Europe as subjects realized house numbers were yet another way governments could exercise control over their money, time and bodies. A Swiss visitor to Austria was “horrified to see numbers on the houses which appear to us a symbol of the hand of the rule determinedly taking possession of the private individual.”

But with the burdens of street addresses came privileges. House numbering was “one of the most important innovations of the era of Enlightenment,” Mr. Tantner said. Assigning each house a number simultaneously advanced two bedrock principles of Enlightenment thought: rationality and equality. Cities were now easy to navigate, and people easy to find. A peasant’s home was numbered in the same way as an aristocrat’s. And residents soon noticed the advantages in mail delivery and advertising rewards for lost pets, like the “Bolognese puppy, a male white all over and having blue eyes but with one lighter blue than the other and a small muzzle and a black nose” whose lonely owner was waiting for him at No. 222 Bognergasse in the winter of 1771.","And none of those addresses appeared on her tribal ID, which Ms. Vivier presented when she tried to vote in 2014.

185,https://www.neweurope.eu/article/the-no-growth-prescription-for-misery/,"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",New Europe,The “no-growth” prescription for misery,"From their ivory towers, nearly 240 academics have declared that economic growth is bad for Europe and the planet. In two months, they and global supporters of the “no-growth economy” have held conferences in Mexico City, Malmö, and Brussels.

Their efforts herald a return to an earlier, thoroughly debunked form of alarmist environmentalism that is detached from reality and disdainful of billions of the world’s people.

The campaigners claim we must stop economic growth because the planet is crossing environmental boundaries, and inequality between humans is increasing.

But for the most important environmental issues, economic growth has solved problems, not created them. The cleanest places are not the poorest countries, but the richer economies that have cleaned up their act. As societies become richer, individuals can afford to stop worrying about food and sanitation and to start worrying about the environment.

Indoor air pollution is the world’s biggest environmental killer, claiming lives because poor people burn dung and wood for cooking and heating. As societies get richer, people can afford cleaner technology. In 1990, indoor air pollution caused more than 8% of deaths; in 2016 it was 4.7%. Each year 1.2 million fewer people die from indoor air pollution, despite an increase in population.

Outdoor air pollution worsens as societies first leave extreme poverty. But then it declines markedly as growth, technological change, and public attitudes affect policies and regulations. In China, for example, sulphur dioxide emissions peaked in 2006 and have been declining since.

The world’s forests tell a similar story. For most of human history, trees were decimated wherever humans settled. Higher agricultural yields and changing attitudes have meant rich countries are increasingly preserving forests and reforesting.

Moreover, economic growth delivers improved access to all the vital things that most people on the planet demand or want: health, education, security, and mobility. Both within and between countries, life satisfaction increases with higher incomes. A study in Europe asking whether prosperity enhanced quality of life found that, “Europeans’ life-quality is better in wealthier societies.”

The no-growth campaigners claim that inequality is at the heart of their concern, but they studiously ignore the vast majority of the planet. The US has experienced a clear increase in inequality: the top 1% earned 18% of income in 1913; this fell to 10.4% in 1976 and returned to 20% in 2014. But the experience is markedly different in most of the world, including continental Europe and Japan, where the top 1% earn about half what they did 100 years ago. Globally, inequality has been declining, because many more people in the developing world have emerged from poverty.

Income is not the only indicator of inequality that is dropping. Half of all welfare gains from 1960 to 2000 come from us living longer, healthier lives. In the past half-century, the gap in life expectancy between the world’s wealthiest and poorest countries has narrowed from 28 to 19 years. As a result, lifespan inequality is lower than it has been for two centuries.

Global trade and economic growth have transformed lives on a scale that was once unimaginable. Two centuries ago, around 94% of the planet was impoverished. In 2015, the World Bank found that for the first time ever, less than 10% of the world’s population was living in extreme poverty. Between 1990 and today, the number of people living in extreme poverty fell by more than one billion.

The latter-day Malthusians are opposed to extending these tremendous benefits to more of the world because they believe that global warming will be so bad that it justifies stopping growth. This contradicts the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says, “for most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will be small relative to the impacts of other drivers” like changes in population, age, income, and technology.

According to the IPCC, the total impact of climate change amounts to about 0% of GDP now, and in 2100 will cost 2-4% of GDP. That’s a problem, but not one that remotely justifies blocking people’s opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty.

The solution to climate change – like so many other challenges – will come from technology. We need to work far harder to make green energy cheaper and more efficient than fossil fuels, so we can continue to lift millions from poverty without emitting carbon dioxide.

With blinkered analysis and misplaced concern, the academics essentially say that to reduce global warming slightly, we should end growth that can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty, avoid millions of air pollution deaths, and give billions the opportunity of a better life through improved health care, shelter, education, and income.

There is something deeply disturbing about academics’ telling others to forgo the benefits they have enjoyed. What the world really needs is far more growth and far less hypocrisy.

Walking into the rain-soaked village more than a year later, there were no specific signs of the outburst of sudden, gruesome violence that killed 10 Rohingya Muslims, and no trace of the mass grave in which they were buried.

However, the legacy of the larger campaign of murder, rape and destruction that swept across the state last year was unmistakable: The village's entire Rohingya Muslim population was gone.

Their homes have been burned, their neighbourhoods gutted down to charred tree trunks.

Not a single Muslim villager was left.

""I don't think they will come back,"" said Kyaw Soe Moe, the village's administrator.

A crop of homes recently built nearby will house new Rakhine Buddhist and Hindu residents, he said.

Victims and a variety of outside investigators accuse Myanmar's military of planning the attack on the Rohingya minority in what the UN and human rights groups describe as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar says its forces were acting to protect citizens against terrorists who operate among the Rohingya, a population many in this country consider to be illegal immigrants — outsiders they call ""Bengalis"" despite the fact they've lived in the country for generations.

The exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya, the majority of whom fled on foot north to Bangladesh, has altered Rakhine, a long-neglected state twisted by poverty and internecine tension. Conditions are so hostile, the exodus quietly continues even now.

And recent developments on the ground have raised concerns that the sudden, gaping absence is being entrenched.

On a rare media tour of northern Rakhine, several construction projects could be seen in among the paddy fields, with new blue-roofed housing standing out in the lush green. Men were busy working under the hot sun to expand the roads. All of it, local officials insist, in an effort to develop a poor state for the benefit of all its ethnic groups.

Also transformative to Rakhine state is the sheer number of villages that have disappeared, seemingly burned and bulldozed systematically. UN estimates put the destruction at 360 villages, and many of their remnants could be seen as the convoy of journalists drove out of Inn Din, heading farther north in the killing zone.

Crowds of topless coconut trees could be spotted from the road, each charred thicket marking the site of an eviscerated village.

A large expanse overgrown by green and dotted with tree stumps is all that seemed to remain of Chein Khar Li, a village where Human Rights Watch says 700 buildings were burned down.

The village's location could only be confirmed with the help of a map app.

'No genocide happened here'

The tour was organized by Myanmar's Ministry of Information and offered only fleeting glimpses of the region. There were no stops at any destroyed villages that were once home only to Rohingya Muslims, despite several requests from the journalists, including CBC News.

Those villages were swept up in a murderous rampage that likely killed more than 10,000 Rohingya, according to Doctors Without Borders.

The violence started when a militant Rohingya group attacked a security post on Aug. 25, 2017, killing 12 security force members. The militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation, or ARSA, is also accused of a massacre of Hindus in the ensuing violence.

However, a growing body of evidence collected by various rights groups suggests the security forces may have been planning a campaign of violence against the Rohingya long before the security post killings.

A UN fact-finding mission concluded the campaign of murder, sexual assault and dislocation had genocidal intent and that the military's top brass should be put on trial.

Myanmar officials didn't allow the UN fact-finders into the country and reject their conclusions. The government tells an alternative story, partly through highly controlled trips to the region where the atrocities unfolded.

""No genocide happened here,"" U Myint Khaing, administrator of Maungdaw Township, said at a briefing for journalists.

He blamed the torching of villages and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people on ARSA.

""If there's a genocide … why are Muslims still here?""

'Cementing the expulsion'

Yet the officials' own statistics show just how stark the demographic transformation has been: Half a million people have fled the Maungdaw district of northern Rakhine, said U Ye Htoo, the district's deputy director.

The district was once 90 per cent Muslim: farmers, traders, labourers, rickshaw drivers. The UN Refugee Agency says more than two-thirds of refugees sitting in the camps of Bangladesh come from Maungdaw.

The local officials, who also use the term ""Bengali"" to describe Rohingya, insist they're working to repatriate them under an agreement reached with Bangladesh.

Border guards wait at the land crossing between Myanmar and Bangladesh. A reception centre was built to repatriate Rohingya who fled Myanmar a year ago. Of the hundreds of thousands who left, fewer than 200 have returned. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

Officials said two reception centres and a transit camp that can hold some 25,000 people have been built in Rakhine to accommodate returnees. A new village plan is also being implemented, under which nearly 1,500 new homes have already been built for returnees of all ethnicities, they said. The government says its repatriation plan does include a cash-for-work program to help villagers participate in the rebuilding.

With little free access to Rakhine, it is difficult to verify the intent of such activity. There have been accusations the construction is appropriating abandoned Rohingya land. Others question why the Rohingya aren't simply allowed to rebuild their own villages.

The UN's special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, recently reported she was ""extremely worried that the activities of the civilian and military authorities in northern Rakhine state are cementing the expulsion of the Rohingya, as development projects fundamentally alter the landscape.""

Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East Asia, sees little evidence Myanmar wants the Rohingya to return from Bangladesh. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

There is also international skepticism about Myanmar's willingness to properly investigate the crimes committed on its soil, given the main accused is the military, which shares in ruling the country. And there is skepticism, too, about Myanmar's desire — and ability, for that matter — to repatriate the refugees.

""There are no people and there are no villages,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia director for Amnesty International.

""That tells volumes about the fact that the Myanmar state, to a certain extent, is satisfied with the outcome of this campaign, which has been the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people across the border to Bangladesh.""

A look at the Bangladesh side of the no man's land between Bangladesh and Myanmar back in September 2017. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC )

Myanmar says it is committed to repatriation, but many in the majority-Buddhist country believe Rohingya do not belong — and nationalist Buddhists are constantly on the lookout for signs Myanmar's leaders are siding with religious minorities over the majority.

In parts of northern Rakhine, Muslims form the majority and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists have long felt threatened. Many believe the world has ignored atrocities committed by Muslim militants.

""Rakhine Buddhist killing Muslims, it's just one out of a hundred,"" said Taw Kin Ten Ji, a 52-year-old resident of Inn Din. ""The difference between Rakhine and Muslim is that Rakhine Buddhists are kind and feel for others.""

Empty reception centre

In a dark hall with a low ceiling in a village near the town of Maungdaw, journalists were introduced to Marmak Shaw Yee. He said his family of six returned from Bangladesh on foot, a story he also told a state English-language newspaper here in September. In both cases, he echoed the officials' view that ARSA was to blame for the crisis.

""My properties and house were burnt. We are living like beggars,"" he said. ""I was so angry. And it happened because of ARSA.

""That's why I'm talking to the media — so the world knows.""

However, at a reception centre at the border with Bangladesh that's staffed by officers ready to welcome returnees, there were none for journalists to meet.

As of the last week of September, a total 171 people had returned from Bangladesh since the centre opened in January.

How committed Myanmar is to repatriation depends on which government official is speaking. There is strong opposition in some government corners — especially because so many in Myanmar's population oppose it.

In a report released this week, the UN Refugee Agency said conditions do not yet exist for a safe and dignified return for the displaced. Lee, the UN's special rapporteur, said any repatriation is ""extremely premature.""

Some critics doubt it is realistic at all in a country where a government official doesn't think twice before describing the exodus as ""Bengalis"" simply ""going home.""

'We are afraid'

More than 5,000 Rohingya Muslims live in a mishmash of tents and wretchedness that's fed by rain and unrelenting heat, with nothing more than a barbed wire fence separating them from what had been their homeland for generations.

They are stuck in a no man's land at the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, but returning to their old lives isn't an option.

The situation is not safe for Rohingya in Myanmar, said Dil Mohammed, who also spoke to CBC last year inside the no man's land on the Bangladesh side.

""We are afraid [for] our life,"" he said in halting English, this time speaking to the journalists on the tour, through Myanmar's border fence.

Dil Mohammed explains why the Rohingya stuck in a no man's land between Bangladesh and Myanmar are wary of returning to their home state:

Stuck in no man's land. The National 0:44 Thousands of Rohingya Muslims are stranded in a no man's land between Myanmar and Bangladesh. Their unofficial spokesperson, Dil Mohammed, explains why they can't go home. 0:44

At minimum, he said, Rohingya must be granted citizenship and freedom of movement, and compensated for their losses.

But these are longstanding demands that are unlikely to be met in the short term.

""So, in effect, that means that Myanmar would have to dismantle a system of ethnic segregation, apartheid-type, and we are not seeing any of this at the moment,"" said Bequelin.

A good first step to give exiles confidence they won't be targeted again would be to prosecute the crimes that led to the exodus in the first place, he said.

The UN has created an international group to begin collecting and preserving evidence for a potential future trial.

But in Myanmar, both civilian and military leaders have bristled at the idea of outsiders coming to investigate.

The country's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, recently defended a government-commissioned investigative panel as credible, independent — and quite enough.

Dr. Aung Tun Thet is a member of an investigative panel, established by the Myanmar government, looking at the violence that led to the exodus of Rohingya last year. He says Myanmar won't assign blame just because it's under international pressure to do so. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

It is comprised of hand-picked panellists, including one from Japan and another from the Philippines, and two more from Myanmar, including Dr. Aung Tun Thet. He was an economic adviser to the country's former president and an honorary professor at the University of British Columbia. He says outsiders do not appreciate the complexity of the situation in Rakhine and has said publicly he doesn't believe the violence there was systematic.

""I fear to portray [it] as religious or intercommunal issue might be going a bit too far,"" he told CBC News. He says it is partly a border security issue.

Myanmar won't assign blame because of international pressure, he said. ""We would do it because we think it's needed. So it will be on our terms, at our pace, and whatever we think suits the whole nation.""

'Hidden humanitarian crisis'

Also key to any repatriation effort will be how life evolves for those Rohingya who remain in Myanmar. Despite their hardships, Rohingya here and in Bangladesh stay in close touch on social media with their cellphones.

The UN Refugee Agency estimates nearly 500,000 remain in their own homes in Rakhine — a population that was already reliant on humanitarian aid before the crisis.

The government barred most aid organizations last year after the violence erupted.

Pierre Peron, with the UN's Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says he's concerned the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar could be worse than aid groups know. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

""I'm concerned that there's a hidden humanitarian crisis happening that we're unable to measure,"" said Pierre Peron, who has worked in Rakhine for five years with the UN's Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Last month, for the first time in a year, the government allowed some UN workers limited access to 23 villages in Rakhine to try to assess the needs. The UN's first report released last week says all communities are finding it hard to put food on the table — partly due to fear and mistrust.

The military extends deep into society, even at the village level.

While some people are limiting their movements because they fear neighbouring communities, ""others, particularly the Muslim communities, are not allowed to move freely,"" said UN spokesperson Andrej Mahecic.

It didn't take long for the fear and mistrust to surface in a village in northern Rakhine that government officials on the tour had held up as a model of inter-ethnic harmony.

The sun sets on a not-so-impromptu gathering in Inn Din village. Authorities asked Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu residents to gather at a school to show foreign journalists how everyone gets along in some parts of northern Rakhine. But a Muslim man told CBC not everyone is equal. Rohingya do not have citizenship in Myanmar. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC )

A Rakhine Buddhist resident said the recent unexplained killing of a farmer has people worried about the possibility of another outbreak of violence.

""If there's a problem, we run,"" he said.

A Rohingya Muslim resident complained about the constraints he lives under. ""We don't have citizenship here. How can we be happy if we're not equal?""

Myanmar observers are concerned it would take very little for violence to erupt again. The UNHCR says conditions are hostile enough in the north that, even now, people are still leaving.

But the most vulnerable inside Myanmar are some 130,000 Rohingya who are kept against their will in camps for internally displaced people.

Stuck for six years

The Thet Kae Pyin camp near Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, is no place for children but it is full of them: children carrying toddlers, or playing in muddy lanes lined by ramshackle homes.

Many Rohingya Muslims were forced into camps in 2012, when the rape and killing of a Rakhine Buddhist woman sparked violence that escalated into riots and the torching of Muslim property and mosques.

Some at Thet Kae Pyin are confined just down the road from where they once lived. Military checkpoints control who comes in or out. Camp-dwellers must get permission even to go to the hospital in Sittwe. Children aren't being schooled in Burmese, weakening the prospect of their reintegration.

More than 100,000 Rohingya are essentially trapped in several camps for internally displaced persons near Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state. Authorities deny their freedom of movement. Many used to live and work just a few kilometres away. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

Like most other Rohingya in Myanmar, they are denied citizenship and freedom of movement. Some have been waiting to move back to their neighbourhoods for more than six years.

The government says it plans to close the camps, but there is no clear plan for what comes next. In the meantime, the people inside have become hopeless, Peron said.

""They're not able to leave the camp,"" the UN official said. ""They're not able to go find work.""

The camp's filthy alleys are warning to anyone outside the country even considering a return on Myanmar's terms.

""It's quite understandable that the Rohingya in Bangladesh are reluctant to come back if they're going to go to a camp,"" Peron said.

In broken English, one man in Thet Kae Pyin summed up what's needed most: ""Please, freedom.""

In a first floor office inside the complex, the feared “blue squad” has assembled, forming a semi-circle around their boss, Anand Shinde, who is pumping them up. At 10.30am, the phalanx, dressed in blue uniforms, hurries down the wooden staircase and hits the streets around the market. Their target: shopkeepers and street vendors using plastic bags.

The blue squad – middle-aged and greying – may not look intimidating but their weapon, a hefty 5,000 rupee (£52) fine, has reduced grown men to begging, they say. They move swiftly, striding into shops, rifling under the counter and, if they find plastic bags, impos a fine on the shopkeeper.

“No questions. No excuses. We don’t accept any bullshit. The fine is immediate and paid in cash on the spot,” says squad member Annie George sternly. “However, our goal is not to punish, but to make people aware. We met street hawkers and told them, don’t do it for us, do it for your children.”

From Starbucks and McDonalds to tiny street food stall owners, no one is exempt from the ban on single use plastic, introduced on 30 June by the authorities in the state of Maharashtra and in Mumbai, its capital.

Our goal is not to punish but to make people aware. Don’t do it for us, do it for your children Annie George

The ban was prompted by vast quantities of plastic rubbish clogging up the already blocked drains during this year’s monsoon. Most other Indian cities are scarred by mountains of plastic, but Mumbai, with its 20 million people concentrated in a tiny island, experiences near-catastrophic disruption during the monsoon when sewers and drains fail to cope with the rain.

The ban prohibits the use of plastic bags, disposable cups and plates, and bottles under a certain size.

A walk through Crawford Market shows that some shopkeepers have either switched voluntarily to paper bags or learned the hard way. “It hurt me to pay that massive fine. I was upset for days,” says dried fruits seller Zahir Hussain.

In Colaba, a popular street market, Varun Seth has discarded the plastic pouches he used to wrap jewellery in favour of tiny paper bags. On the roadside next to him, a vendor wraps fruit in newspaper – not so easy. “It’s difficult for customers to carry fruit home this way but if that’s the law then I guess it’s for our own good and that of our children,” he says.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to make India free of single-use plastic by 2022. Most of the country’s 29 states have a full or partial ban, but public awareness is low and the law is rarely enforced. That is why the diligence of the blue squad has attracted attention.

Vasant Patel, the owner of Beauty Basics cosmetic store opposite Crawford Market, pleads ignorance. “I was told these bags are OK,” he says, pointing to a kind of bag that looks like cloth but is in fact plastic. “And surely I should be given some notice?” he asks George and her colleague, Smita Chandane.

“That’s what they all say. They all say they didn’t know what was allowed. Well, after he’s paid the fine, he will know all right,” says Chandane.

It is the same story at the beauty parlour next door. Tahir Motwala looks sheepish when George and Chandane find piles of plastic bags, even though he has displayed two paper carrier bags on a shelf behind the till.

George says this is a popular tactic: prominently display paper bags, while keeping plastic bags under the counter. After a tense few minutes, Mowala realises he cannot win; he pays the fine.

Shinde, the municipal inspector for plastic, is aware that a ban alone is not enough. Shopkeepers need cheap alternatives. “We are encouraging women’s self-help groups by giving them sewing machines to make cheap cloth bags. They have been given designated spots across the city where they congregate and where shopkeepers come to buy, and place orders for cloth bags,” he says.

His department also supports groups that are making disposable plates and cutlery from leaves, wood, jute and concoctions such as a mixture of molasses and corn starch. “We need an eco-system to make the ban sustainable,” says Shinde.

The city authorities have been realistic about the need to protect street food sellers. They need small thin plastic bags to sell liquid items such as lentils and curd to poor labourers. Or to protect their produce, such as bread, against the dust and rain. “Anything above 50 microns such as that kind of thin pouch is allowed. We can’t ruin their livelihoods,” says Shinde.

The 250 members of the blue squad can get into sticky situations. “Shopkeepers start shouting and arguing because 5,000 rupees is a big sum. We’ve been heckled and abused,” says George.

For her, the job satisfaction lies in seeing instant results. By 1pm, the squad has filled eight big bags with plastic carrier bags. From the end of June to the beginning of October, they seized almost 24,000 kilos of plastic and collected 10 million rupees in fines. “We are just a speck against a 20 million population … but we’re not doing too badly.”



","In a first floor office inside the complex, the feared “blue squad” has assembled, forming a semi-circle around their boss, Anand Shinde, who is pumping them up.
They move swiftly, striding into shops, rifling under the counter and, if they find plastic bags, impos a fine on the shopkeeper.

This is not a random observation. It goes to the heart of the problem not only in Muslim lands but in the world as a whole. It reiterates the simple yet fundamental idea that there can be no peace, no order and no security without justice.

Take the Palestinian issue. It is the longest standing occupation of modern history. The saga of the Palestinian people has no equivalent in any other political conflict in the 20th century. Since 1948, countless initiatives have sought the resolve the conflict. Nations went to war over the issue. But no peace initiative ended the conflict. Why? Contrary to what the Israeli propagandists claim, it is not because the Palestinians and Arabs are not interested in peace or Israel has no peace partner. It is because the so-called peace proposals always lacked the core element of justice for the Palestinians. Partitioning Palestinian lands and depriving the Palestinians of their basic rights for the security of Israel cannot lead to a sustainable peace because it is not based on justice. An enduring peace will be possible if and only when the Palestinians are accorded their rights, treated equally and fairly. No security consideration or political urgency will change this fact.

The Syrian war is another case where a political solution will be possible only when it is based on justice for all. With the help of its allies, the Syrian regime may claim to have won the war. But this does not make it fair or legitimate. The regime's shameless attempts to erase the Syrian opposition from the ground and from the negotiating table will not bring peace or stability to Syria. An enduring peace will be possible only when all Syrians are treated fairly and equally.

The same principle applies to the growing gap between the rich and the poor countries of the world. The fact that the current economic system makes the rich countries richer and keeps the poor in an endless abyss of poverty does not make the world a better place.

In the Islamic intellectual tradition, justice means ""putting things in their rightful place."" It is to give everything its due. It is to recognize everyone's right regardless of their status, ethnicity or religion. As a universal principle, it holds a society together. As a sociopolitical principle, it maintains order and stability.

In this broad sense, peace cannot be just absence of war because it is not enough to prevent conflict temporarily to reach peace. It has to have other elements that would make peace an enduring reality. What some scholars have called ""positive peace"" entails ethical and political principles by which peace can be lasting and produce security, stability and prosperity for all. This brings us back to the principle of justice, i.e., putting everything in its proper place and giving everything its due.

These were among the issues discussed at the second TRT World Forum held in Istanbul on Oct. 3-4 under the theme ""Envisioning Peace and Security in a Fragmented World."" Gathering together world leaders and leading experts, the Forum sent a powerful message about peace, order, security and justice in an increasingly chaotic and disordered world. In his address at the closing session, President Erdogan underlined his firm belief in a peaceful world order based on justice. From the U.N.'s current structure and Turkey's EU membership to the Syrian war and the Palestinian conflict, he outlined Turkey's global peace diplomacy that seeks peace and justice not just for the powerful and the rich but for all nations of the world.

In this world of growing interdependence, no one is safe until everyone is safe. No single nation will enjoy prosperity in the full sense of the term until wealth is shared fairly. A world without justice cannot a safe place for anyone. It only produces more conflict and suffering. And it makes everyone unsafe and insecure.

Peace as an enduring value can be achieved only when it is based on justice. All other options are doomed to fail. The history of modern conflicts is a sad testimony to this simple fact.","It reiterates the simple yet fundamental idea that there can be no peace, no order and no security without justice.

When news came in that this year’s Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to former ISIS captive Nadia Murad and Congolese physician Dr. Denis Mukwege, I realised just how powerful media can be. Dr. Mukwege and Ms. Murad were honoured by the Nobel Committee “for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict”.

I first met Murad in 2016 in New York, and subsequently in London and Davos. I couldn’t help but recall how far the world had come since the plight of the Yazidis first hit the headlines. Most people hadn’t heard of this tiny, pre-Islamic minority community of Iraqis living in the Sinjar mountains, until the ISIS came along to terrorise, kidnap and essentially annihilate them.

I first heard about the Yazidis at the Women In The World (WITW) summit in New York, the live journalism platform founded by award-winning editor Tina Brown, to showcase stories of courageous women. In 2015, when Vian Dakhil, the sole female Yazidi member of Parliament from Iraq, and her sister Deelan, spoke on the WITW stage, they begged for the world to pay attention to the horror ISIS was unleashing in the region. By then, Nadia, then 19, had already been captured by the ISIS. Luckily, she managed to escape.

Ms. Brown recalls the first time she met Nadia. “She has a small voice, which seemed to rise in firmness as she told us her story, unflinchingly and with so much suppressed pain,” she says. “I was incredibly impressed with her courage, speaking about the atrocities she not only witnessed but experienced first-hand.”

‘Hunted’

In September 2016, I met Nadia at a small gathering at Ms. Brown’s home. She was like no other young woman I had ever met. She looked, in a word…hunted. And then — she spoke. She described, via a translator, the horror she and many other victims had suffered. She told us she was from a farming family, and that life was peaceful before the ISIS came and kidnapped her, took her to Mosul and sold her. She was held for three months and experienced unspeakable acts. To be in that living room, up close, with a survivor of such abhorrent, ghastly abuse, was inexplicable. There wasn’t a dry eye in a room of journalists, activists and philanthropists. We had no way of comprehending how people could perpetrate such cruelty on one another.

In an interview with WITW, Nadia was asked why she was risking everything by speaking out about her ordeal as there was a threat to her life. She said: “I am continuing to do this because millions of women and girls have no rights. Daesh (ISIS) took my family, my future, my life. But what I have in my heart, and what I’ve always had, is justice. Despite everything they did, they couldn’t take away the knowledge I had that I was right and they were wrong.”

Subsequently, Amal Clooney took up Nadia’s case and that of Yazidi women at the International Criminal Court, which got the Yazidis more public attention. This year’s Nobel Peace Prize, Ms. Brown says, “Shows that the world IS watching and that we need to continue to fight to stop violence against women and to support all women like Nadia. Violence perpetrated against women is finally at the forefront.”

The steps included halving salaries of public employees, forcing thousand of employees in to early retirement and stopping payments for the supply of electricity in to the Strip.

He presented his credentials during an interview with EURACTIV.

Alexander Stubb is former Prime Minister of Finland and contender for the European People’s Party’s Spitzenkandidat position.

In an exclusive video interview for EURACTIV, Stubb spoke to Alexandra Brzozowski and Beatriz Ríos about his candidature.

What we know so far:

While on unpaid leave from his position as vice-president of the European Investment Bank, Alexander Stubb announced his desire to lead the EPP into next year’s European elections as a possible Spitzenkandidat.

Too extrovert for Finns and too liberal for his own party, he belongs to the most progressive wing of the conservatives.

For now, Stubb has avoided direct confrontation with his opponent, German MEP Manfred Weber, who counts on the support of powerful German Chancellor Angela Merkel. However, the odds might be in Stubb’s favour due to his government experience, which Weber lacks.

***

Mr. Stubb, why did you decide to enter the Spitzenkandidaten race in first place and do you think that opposing a German candidate without previous government experience could play in your favour to be elected EPP lead candidate?

If I were to say in one word, why I am running for Commission president, it is values. Because I firmly believe and am afraid that European values, human rights, fundamental rights, equality, tolerance, rule of law, liberal democracy… are all under threat at this particular moment, from outside of the Union, from inside of the Union, and perhaps from inside of the EPP as well.

I think in times of uncertainty you need to anchor onto something, like these values. I want to defend these values. That is the main reason for running.

2016, in particular, was a rough time for us, who call themselves liberal internationalists or pro-Europeans, or whatever you want to call us. It is time to be on the barricades.

What are my advantages in comparison with my “competitor” Manfred Weber? I have never compared myself to anyone else, really. Manfred and I are good friends, we both joined the European Parliament in 2004 and then our paths deviated in 2008 when I became Finnish foreign minister. Then, subsequently, prime minister, finance minister and I was in government for 8 years.

I am a bit of an EU nerd, I know the EU institutions inside-out. I have worked in all of them pretty much: the Council, the Commission, the Parliament and now the European Investment Bank.

But probably, I guess the toughest schooling that one can have is to be in the European Council. Both as a deputy ‘antici’ taking notes, and then behind the microphone. That’s my experience – and I only speak for myself, not for other candidates.

European values are clearly under threat also from within the EPP. How do you feel about Manfred Weber’s “flirtations” with Salvini and Orbán? Is there any intention for the EPP to collaborate with the more hardline right-wing parties?

For me, the EPP is about values – and certainly far-right is not a value that the EPP holds true. I don’t like the flirtations with Salvini, or with PiS in Poland, or with any illiberal elements of European values.

I think we need to split this into two. One side is the question of what the EPP does stand for. If you don’t stick to EPP values and rules, then you should be out. Go do something else.

The second side is, who do you work with after the elections? And there, I think you have to be realistic. Because the truth is that probably we are going to have very messy election results. We have populists from the left and right. I would like of course to see a strong centre-coalition of the mainstream pro-European parties.

I have had experience in dealing with coalitions. We had the ‘True Finns’ in our government. Now the ‘True Finns’ are not in the government anymore, their popularity is half down and the party is split into two. That’s what happens when you get into power. Am I saying that we should hug all the populist to death, as we did in Finland? The answer is no, there are no easy solutions.

We need to take populism seriously, but it doesn’t mean that populism has to be brought into the EPP, quite the contrary: Stay out.

As you mentioned, the results of the upcoming elections are likely to be messy and therefore may lead to broad coalitions.

Emmanuel Macron is likely to play an important role in the elections, too. Do you believe, like he does, that this vote will be a face-off between populist forces and progressive Europeans? How do you think Macron could shape the campaign?

I think this election is not necessarily going to be so much about left versus right, populists versus progressives. It is going to be more about localists versus globalists, pro-European versus anti-European, nationalists versus anti-nationalists…It is important that we forge the sensible centre that can drive the European integration process forward.

I am obviously three things: I am pro-European, I am positive and I am pragmatic. What I am trying to push for is more Europe where is necessary and less Europe where it is not. At the same time, I don’t want to be the person who incites hate and fear to drive the political agenda.

There are many people in political positions now that do that, they incite fear about immigration, technology or jobs. I think, we should look at the bright side and then try to provide some solutions. I hope I can do that.

I think Macron has a lot of good ideas. I obviously don’t agree with all of it. But, you know, if he wants to come to the EPP, he is more than welcome.

Jean-Claude Juncker said at the start of his mandate this was the “Commission of the last chance”. What would you have done differently in his place, and what do you have to offer for the next period?

The Juncker Commission should be given credit and I quite often say that it is not the president that makes the agenda, it is the agenda that makes the president. We forget things. Look what this Commission did. It dealt with the Euro crisis, it dealt with the migration crisis and it dealt with the aftermath of 2016: Brexit and Donald Trump. I think for all intents and purposes, it did a pretty good job.

Every Commission and every Commission president is different, so I would probably bring my own personality into the Commission presidency. There is a generational difference: I joke around, I have great respect for Jean-Claude Juncker, because he uses an old Nokia phone. I have an iPhone, a smartphone. I try to keep up to date as I have two teenage kids, 17 and 14 years old, who make sure that I stay up to par with what is going on. I would probably do things a little bit differently.

But if you look at the broad agenda, I would focus a lot on technological developments, the digital revolution…Artificial Intelligence, robotisation, the internet of things, 3D printing, digitisation – it will change the economy and work, it will change politics and media, it will change science and probably the future of mankind.

I would start addressing these questions very seriously. I have been an avid student of this for a few years and I think it is a fascinating area.

We are going to have huge moral and ethical questions. We are going to have questions of economic growth and jobs, about the future, and I think the European Commission needs to be modern on this. We need to be on the ball, otherwise, someone else will be doing it. When we start approaching algorithms taking care of things, I want to have the good guys, rather than the bad guys, do the algorithms.

We see traditional parties being in crisis. Have they failed to address people’s needs? What lessons need to be learnt ahead of the European elections?

Democratic politics now is much more disruptive than what it used to be before – and much more demanding as well. At the same time, I think we should be honest with ourselves. Politicians are less influential than what they used to be. Life is not about backdoor smoke-filled cabinet room deals. It is more about openness, about transparency.

We know that technology has changed individual behaviour, the pattern in which the people think about politics. And once you start admitting that, take yourself down from the pedestal of being some kind of a big leader.

I think that is already a step in the right direction. Democracy needs to reinvent itself, that is what is doing right now, and technology can help us to do that.

Many people want to see more transparency in European politics, particularly when it comes to the decision-making process in the European Council. Where do you stand on this?

I have been pretty much at all levels in politics. In national parliament, in the European Parliament, in the government and in various Council formats. I guess, my rule of thumb would be, that in parliaments you need to have transparent committee meetings and obviously transparent plenary sessions.

My experience and recommendation for governments is that many key decisions in governments are born in negotiation and, unfortunately, you cannot do that negotiation in the open, because then it becomes theatre. You need to be transparent about the process, but at the end of the day, we need to have the trust that two or more human beings can have a rational dialogue and can come up with a decision.

I was always for transparency on some formations of the Council. For instance, when the Council legislates, it would be good to have open debates; it would be a little bit more interesting. Now, they are done very mechanically – and to be honest, they are quite boring.

A European Council in public? I will be very frank with you, I don’t think it would work. It is a very intimate club. Prime ministers and presidents sort of understand each other. It is almost as if you go to a big psychotherapy session, where a lot of these prime ministers come from home with all the pressure that they have and then they come into this room, the 28 of them, plus the Commission president and the president of the European Council and they almost hug each other: “Nice to see you, now we can be ourselves for a little while and discuss European problems”.

If it became a show, when you sit in the European Council – the highest decision makers – I am afraid it just wouldn’t work. We need to be realistic about this. In that sense, I would say that transparency has its limits.

Would you describe yourself as a feminist? What concrete steps would you have in mind to work towards gender equality in Europe?

I am a fairly classic Scandinavian Nordic male and therefore, by definition, a feminist. I am quite proud of that when I was prime minister, the majority of my government were women – 9 out of 17. Out of my party, 4 ministers were women, 3 were men. Was this a goal in itself? No, it just happens because we have bright great women who were able to do that.

What kind of policies? Obviously, I am an egalitarian. In that sense, when it comes to working life, when it comes to life in general, family, studies…I don’t see a gender difference. I never wanted to see that. I don’t treat men and women differently. This patriarchal world for me is something quite old school.

What would be a measure that I would take? I would try to increase the number of women in the Commission. In the Barroso Commission it was about a fifth, in the Juncker Commission it is is about a third, I would be aiming at putting a target at 40%. Will I achieve it? I really don’t know, but I hope we could achieve it.

And the reason I say that the European Commission also needs to reflect the demography of Europe – men, women, all different types of backgrounds, diversity – is great in this sense. And of course, I take gender issues as horizontal to everything that I do. This is what Nordic men are all about, I guess. Call us softies, but I am happy to be a softy on that.

You are also very active on social media. How do you rate the code of practice against disinformation and fake news ahead of the elections and the fear of interference?

There is definitively going to be interference in the election and I think it is great that the current Commission is working on this with different types of units and people, trying to fend off fake news.

We get a lot of cyber-type incidents, for instance from Russia. I mean, I look at my own Twitter feed: When I put out a video – on ‘Europe is about solving problems, not making problems’, or ‘We must stop the Salvinisation of Europe’ – suddenly ‘bang!’ I get fifty to sixty comments which are completely coordinated. They come from different quoters, people who are anti-European, or anti-Western values, and so on and so forth.

We going to see a lot of this. It is the sort of new normal. And obviously, we have to work against this. We can do a few things: We have to recognise for ourselves: What is fake news, what are cyber attacks and trolls and the rest of it. Secondly, we also need to educate the young to be able to decide and see differences between fake news and real news.

And I feel also the media has an important task on that. We always talk about the media as the ‘Fourth Power’ right next to the legislative, executive and judiciary – the ‘guardian of the people’, the ‘guardian of the truth’. I think it is very important that the media also takes up trying to get the fake news out of the system. In that sense, you have a big responsibility.

You label yourself as the “Next Generation Europe”-President. Well, the next generation is currently experiencing poverty, high youth unemployment and will be one of most impacted by climate change. How you intend to tackle this?

I see myself as next generation as opposed to previous Commission presidents. But I certainly do not see myself as the next generation in comparison, for instance, to my teenage children.

First of all, I think youth unemployment obviously is one of the most serious issues we have at hand. Paradoxically, we have the biggest and highest employment rate in Europe ever, but unemployment and youth unemployment is unacceptable.

What do we need to do? We need to understand that the type of life that my generation leads in three phases – study, work, retire – won’t be the reality for the next generation. It will be more like: Study, work, study again, learn a new skill, work, study, work and retirement is probably a sometimes unrealistic prospect.

I would give three pieces of advice, when I am asked about what youngsters should do. Number one is: learn how to learn, learn how to analyse. It is not about learning simple or single facts anymore. It is about learning to understand and grasp bigger concepts.

The second thing is: learn emotional intelligence, learn empathy, how you treat other human beings. Because as we move towards a society where machines do a lot of the work that we used to do – whether it is physical or mental work – then what is left for us is empathy and the way we treat each other. It is going to be extremely important.

And then, finally, learn how to take care of themselves in another kind of way, because your careers will be very different. Your career will be basically on and off and that means that you will need to be able to cope with the pressures of constant disruption.

I know these are high fluted suggestions, but I think we need to prepare today’s youth for the digital revolution and the required digital skills, because you and I will not know what the labour market looks like in 2050.

And what about climate change then?

The two huge issues that we are grappling in the moment are: One, the technological and digital revolution and what that brings with it. And the other one is climate change. For me, both of them are no brainers in the sense that if don’t handle these, we probably are not going to have anything to handle.

I mean, we look at temperature increases and latest analysis and of course, scary scenarios of what is going to happen if and when the temperature increases 1 or 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees or even 3 degrees by the end of the century. That would be a situation where we would not need to worry about the basics, because everything is going to be crisis management when human beings cannot live where they are anymore, because of drought, because of floods, because of different types of weather related crises.

We just need to keep on working at this. At the moment it does not look optimistic. But I am an optimist. We will find solutions, that is what we humans are there for. When you look at climate change and technology, when you put the two of them together, we usually find solutions.

The voter turnout in the European elections was usually very low. How do you intend to get young people to go out and vote?

Obviously democracy doesn’t exist unless people are engaged or people vote. And obviously always in the European elections the big question is how to get people to vote. I think you have to capture people’s imagination. And that means that you have to communicate Europe better. You have to say why it matters.

You have to say that a member of the European Parliament has more power if he or she is active than a government minister. Every decision that’s taken in the European Parliament is important and if we keep these things in mind, you get people engaged.

Sometimes I think in Europe we’ve tried to be a little bit too rational instead of emotional. I know it sounds a bit strange coming from a Finn, sort of Latino Finn if you will. So what I want to say is that no you know what we need to have more emotion in Europe. We need to deal with Europe with our hearts not necessarily with our minds. We need to have more emotion in Europe. We need to deal with Europe with our hearts, not necessarily with our minds. I mean, I can sit here and talk forever about the values of the four freedoms – free movement of goods, services, people and capital. But then probably people will turn off and say ‘You know Alex, I really don’t care what you’re talking about.’

Paradoxically, I feel that with the election of Trump and Brexit a lot of people woke up to Europe in a different kind of a way. Suddenly, we feel quite emotional about it. I feel emotional about Europe when I watch the Ryder Cup and Europe beats the United States and the rest of it. This is great stuff. We see the European flag and the rest of it, but it goes beyond that.

The things people such as Bono are doing right now, waving the flag at concerts, I think it’s fantastic. I’ve never been huge for symbols, but I’ve started to understand that we need to be a little bit emotional, a little bit more engaged, show a little bit more heart rather than just head when it comes to Europe. Europe is a rational choice, but it needs to feel good.

Having a more and more inward-looking United States, an assertive Russia and an expansionist China, is Europe facing a period of threats to its economy and global position, or an opportunity to become a global leader?

I would say that, because of the voluntary marginalisation of the United States, because of an assertive Russia, and because of an expansionist China, this is actually Europe’s moment. This is the moment when we start seeing power vacuums being created around the world and someone will want to have to fill those power vacuums. And I think Europe can do that.

The only way in which you can do it is through being unified in values. We have to put our money where our mouth is. If we preach Western European values around the world in our dignified foreign policy, then we need to have our own house in order. We can’t look through our fingers, when three journalists are murdered, or when member states violate the fundamental human rights or press freedom around Europe. That needs to be rectified.

Second, on trade: we are the biggest trading power in the world. We set the rules and now we do great bilateral trade agreements – whether it’s with Canada or South Korea, or Japan, or India and perhaps in the future, also with the United States. We keep on working on that because without trade our economies are not going to grow.

And then finally we need to defend multilateralism, multilateral institutions whether it is the UN, the WTO, whether it’s the OECD, whether it’s NATO or the European Union. We need to say that without common rules, common institutions and international law, we have nothing. And if we do these things, I think Europe will survive. A final point: we need to take leadership on climate change and technological development.

There is a lot of talk these days about a Europe of different speeds – would this be opportunity or rather counterproductive?

You see, asking me about differentiated integration, or multispeed, or core Europe is very dangerous, because I wrote my PhD on this. But I’ll give you a short answer. I think we’ve always had flexibility in the European Union, whether it’s been the Schengen agreement, whether it’s been the euro, whether it’s been defence. There are hundreds of examples of directives and regulations where member states have either derogations or join at a later stage.

By definition I would argue that Europe is already flexible. MyPhD thesis, and I still stick to it, is that differentiated integration is a good way of advancing the European integration project. It’s like a nuclear weapon: You can always threaten with it, but never press the actual button, because just the threat forces all of us to join in.

I’ll take the euro as an example. I think that at the end of the day, especially now that the United Kingdom is unfortunately leaving the European Union, we will see a day when all 27 member states are in the euro. It just makes sense.

I always say this being against the European Union is a little bit like being against the Internet. It’s much better to try to impact and influence the content rather than stay outside.

What do you think about Martin Selmayr’s appointment?

Well, I would say I’ve worked and seen a lot of Secretary Generals in the European Institutions over the years. I mean, we go back to Niels Ersbøll in the 1980s and early 1990s, or Émile Noël the last secretary general the European Commission, and the work that I’ve done with Martin Selmayr. I’m very impressed. He knows his stuff. I know that in the Brussels bubble there was a lot of heated moments about his nomination.

How about German power in general in the European Institutions in general then?

I mean, I’ve heard the argument that the there has not been a German commission president since Walter Hallstein. And you know, I speak German, I’m a Germanophone, there’s no question about it.

If you look at German relative power in the institutions at the moment, they have great people. The boss of the European Stability Mechanism – German. The boss of the European Investment Bank, great person, Werner Hoyer, my boss when I’m not on a leave of absence – from Germany. The boss of the Court of Auditors – from Germany. The secretary general of the Commission – a German. The secretary general of the External Action Service – German. The secretary general of the European Parliament – also a German. Now, I could continue this list, but I think all of these people are extremely good. Whether or not they are German.

But let me turn it around and say: There has never been a Nordic Commission president. There has never been a Baltic Commission president. There’s never been a Commission president from Central Europe or Eastern Europe. Shouldn’t it be time?","European values are clearly under threat also from within the EPP.
For me, the EPP is about values – and certainly far-right is not a value that the EPP holds true.
I don’t like the flirtations with Salvini, or with PiS in Poland, or with any illiberal elements of European values.
We need to take populism seriously, but it doesn’t mean that populism has to be brought into the EPP, quite the contrary: Stay out.
If we preach Western European values around the world in our dignified foreign policy, then we need to have our own house in order."

The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Dr. Matthew Hassan Kukah, has said that no President of any country in the world can be as irresponsible in the usage of power as a Nigerian president.

He made this known in Akure, Ondo State on Friday while delivering the annual Ulefunta/Oyemekun Festival lecture entitled “Building blocks for a good society” held at the Francis Idibiye Lecture hall of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA).

According to Kukah, the structure of the Nigerian presidential office makes the holders of the office extremely powerful, so much that he can deploy power the way he wants.

“No president in the world has the kind of power the Nigerian president has and as such, no president in the world can be as irresponsible as the Nigerian president. His power is so much that he can give oil bloc to his girlfriend and many others. You thus can’t be a man of honour and live in a country like Nigeria and not be angry,” he said.

Kukah said that from the first Nigerian Prime Minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa to President Muhammadu Buhari, virtually all of them were dragged into the presidential office, maintaining that this was unlike the presidency of the United States of America where the president does not emerge by circumstance.

“What is the problem? It is the dilemma of leadership. In America, there are basic expectations of what a president should be. For instance, he must have gone through Harvard as an institution, he must have language and track records, not even wealth. You can’t surprise the system. Here in Nigeria, local government chairman wants to be governor; the governor wants to be president and the president doesn’t want to go! Many states have two governors representing them at the National Assembly. Governors have control and monopoly of resources of state and they use same resources to oppress people,” he said.

Kukah said that we have failed in developing mechanisms that will confront instability, maintaining that doing so was the hallmark of great countries.

“In Nigeria, it is not a question of looking for trouble because trouble is already here. The Nigerian state has no capacity to protect itself and there is no loyalty to Nigeria from its citizens but to those who help individuals to get to positions in the system,” he said.

Kukah however singled two former Nigerian leaders out of the leadership rot, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Alhaji Aminu Kano, who he called “architects of a good society.”

“Awolowo, for his major quintessential evidence as somebody who already figured out what he would do with power if he got it. He understood the building blocks for an egalitarian society. Aminu Kano single handedly took on the feudal class in Northern society and had a deep understanding of society, even as he textually talked about a free society in a way and manner that didn’t offend religion,” he said.

While stating that it is not enough for a people to have the building blocks of a good society alone, Kukah also maintained that Nigeria has not been able to build a good society because the country has not obeyed the rules of design.

“We have to understand the building blocks of society which are not too different from the rules of building a house. A good society is not different from the building blocks of society. When a building collapses, it didn’t collapse in a day. It began to collapse a long time ago. For us to build a good society, we have to have eyes that monitor the needs, growth and development and feelings of that society. Then you can be sure of the quality of that society,” he said.

While reviewing the lecture, Professor Kole Omotoso, lauded Kukah for what he called a very profound lecture and said that the only point of departure he had in the lecture was Kukah’s submission that education has the potential to remedy the problems of Nigeria’s existence.

Guests at the occasion included the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, the chairman of the occasion, and many others

Malacanang defended on Thursday the granting of a franchise to the Villar-owned Streamtech Systems Technologies Inc., saying there is no conflict of interest regarding its operation.

On October 18, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. (RA) 11089 granting Streamtech, a firm owned by Paolo Villar, a 25-year franchise to build and operate a telecommunications systems in the country.

Paolo is the son of businessman Manny Villar and incumbent Senator Cynthia Villar. He is also the younger brother of Public Works Secretary Mark Villar.

“First, the Streamtech is a corporation, so we do not know whether or not this cabinet member and the senator are included in the list of stockholders in that corporation,” Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo told reporters.

“Secondly, that has been granted by Congress; and, so I supposed members of Congress have considered the provision of the Constitution, as well, as the ownership of that particular corporation,” he added.

Panelo also stressed the importance of a third major player in the local telecommunications.

“To my mind, what is more important is that we have a third company that will compete with two others and that will bring some benefits to us those using this technology,” the official said.

RA 11089 provides that, Streamtech will deliver wire and/or wireless telecommunications system, international and national broadband system, mobile and cellular, including but not limited to, fiber, optics, multichannel multipoint distribution systems, switches, and value-added services and technologies.","By Prince GolezMalacanang defended on Thursday the granting of a franchise to the Villar-owned Streamtech Systems Technologies Inc., saying there is no conflict of interest regarding its operation.

The Chinese thought they had little to learn from conventional wisdom. Now it’s the West that’s taking notes.

Milton Friedman had a message for China: To get rich, it must be free.

It was 1988. The Soviet Union was tottering. Across Eastern Europe, the communist order was on the verge of collapsing. Trying to avoid its own demise, the Chinese Communist Party had taken small steps toward unshackling its economy from the state. But prices for food and other necessities were surging as a result, and the party’s reformers wanted advice.

They invited Mr. Friedman — the Nobel laureate and champion of economic freedom — to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound in Beijing where the country’s most senior leaders live and work. Sitting down with Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party’s top leader, Mr. Friedman was tactful but insistent. If Beijing wants to help its people thrive, he said, the state must let go faster.

“I hope the Chinese people can become strong and prosperous,” he told Mr. Zhao. “I wish to see China’s reform succeed so that she can contribute more to the progress of mankind.”

China made a different choice. Mr. Zhao and other reformists were ousted a year later. Tanks were sent to Tiananmen Square to teach the people a bloody lesson about challenging the party’s power.

China would instead reform on its terms. It would free entrepreneurs to seek their fortunes, while still keeping a tight grip on essential economic levers. It would set national goals, then persuade or force people and companies to meet them. It would open up to the world at its own pace — and the Communist Party would run the show.

How China became a superpower

To Mr. Friedman and other top economists, the strategy should have failed. Centrally planned economies breed waste and corruption. Big government ambitions cripple future generations with debt. Price controls lead to hunger and want. Official prognosticators invariably blow it. The Soviet Union proved that.

Those experts were wrong. China prospered.

Today it is the world’s second-largest economy. Hundreds of millions of its people have been lifted out of poverty. It is home to the world’s biggest auto industry, the second-most billionaires and the largest single group of internet users. It has some of the richest and most powerful technology companies on the planet.

China succeeded by creating its own model. It borrowed some Western ideas while rejecting others. It opened itself to the world when necessary, and put on the brakes when it chose to. It set goals and backed them with government money. It freed its people to make and spend money, but it forbade them to ask for a better deal. Entrepreneurs built modern China, and the Communist Party kept them in line.

Other potential success stories in Asia and Latin America stuck to the economic script and stumbled. They slashed budgets when international experts told them to, hurting growth. They opened up to the world before they were fully ready to compete — and were tripped up by global turbulence. China’s government, by contrast, reformed slowly and sometimes reluctantly, stepping in when external or internal forces threatened its rule. During financial crises that struck Asia in 1997 and then the world in 2008, China gained strength as other nations faltered.

China’s economy now stands as an alternate narrative to Western ideals. And yet the decisions the Communist Party made to secure its economic future have led Beijing to its biggest test since Tiananmen Square.

Its goals — a complicated mix of juicing the economy, cleaning up the country’s air and water and meeting its people’s rising expectations — have become harder to reach. Its efforts to spur growth have left the country staggering under trillions of dollars in debt, while the world is taking aim at China’s industrial ambitions.

And after three decades of balancing freedom and authoritarianism, China may be leaning too far toward state control under Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader. The Communist Party may be putting too much stock in its own abilities at the expense of the entrepreneurs who drove China’s success.

Milton Friedman might have been right after all.

Or China may still find its way.

Over and over, China has been underestimated by legions of leaders and economists who thought they knew better. “It’s not only the West,” said Justin Lin Yifu, a former chief economist at the World Bank, who was born in Taiwan but defected to China. “It’s almost every country in the world. It’s the multilateral institutions and the academics and intellectuals.”

A Booming Bird Cage

Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, was worried. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, his great Chinese experiment faced collapse.

He had led the country out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution under the idea that its people should make more money. Farmers were given greater choice to plant what they liked and sell it for a profit. Entrepreneurs flocked to special economic zones, essentially capitalist petri dishes where they paid lower taxes and made their own business decisions. The economy surged, millions of people were lifted out of poverty, and China’s growth become the envy of the world.

The boom, though, fostered inflation and corruption. When the tanks rolled through Tiananmen Square, they killed not just pro-democracy activists but also common people angry at surging prices for rice, vegetables and vinegar. The reformers were ousted, and the conservatives who took their place reasserted state control.

By 1990, foreign investors were fleeing and some Communist Party cadres were again suppressing entrepreneurs. Growth had fallen to one-third that of the boom years. Deng feared that, without a spark, the Communist Party would lose its control over China. Reform, he decided, had to be on the agenda again.

Finding the right balance would prove the economic foundation of modern China. Loosen the grip too much, and the Communist Party begins to face a real threat to its hold on power. Tighten too much, and it threatens to squelch the country’s growth.

Reform has swung in one direction or the other, but it has long fit into the model of what one of the architects of modern China, Chen Yun, called a “bird cage economy.” Entrepreneurs were free to spread their wings, as long as they stayed within the cage of government control.

In 1992, Deng embarked on his “southern tour” — a visit to Shenzhen and other emerging capitals of Chinese commerce. He laid out the case for a “socialist market economy” that would twin an embrace of markets with respect for the Communist Party.

“If China does not practice socialism, does not carry on with ‘reform and opening’ and economic development, does not improve the people’s standard of living, then no matter what direction we go,” he said, “it will be a dead end.”

He championed the lessons of people in Shenzhen like Shao Chunyou. Mr. Shao, now a successful entrepreneur who owns an electronics manufacturing company, was one of the hundreds of millions of Chinese who struck a silent pact with his country to pursue riches while staying out of the state’s business.

The crackdown in Tiananmen Square was far from Mr. Shao’s mind when he arrived that summer in Shenzhen. A penniless carpenter from a city in China’s interior, he struggled to find work among the electronics factories and garment mills. He wasn’t allowed to live in Shenzhen without a government permit, so when the police came looking for illegal workers he would hide in a cemetery. Once, he lived off discounted mooncakes after China’s Mid-Autumn festival holiday.

“I still can’t bear looking at mooncakes,” he said.

Three years later, in 1992, Mr. Shao was earning more money at a factory making hardware parts for electronics than he had ever made before. Such successes would cement the country’s path.

Conservative leaders were sidelined for reformers. Local officials loosened up, and banks started lending. China abolished ration coupons for food and drastically reduced the government’s role in setting prices for grain, oil and coal. China’s entrepreneurs responded. Growth surged into double digits.

Two years later, the International Monetary Fund and other leading economic institutions publicly worried that China’s growth was too fast and threatened to spiral out of control. But the lessons from past failures taught China’s leaders to complement their reform efforts with aggressive government action at certain moments.

The leadership forced down prices of essentials like grain, eggs, vegetables and real estate. Even as it pressured bloated state-owned companies to streamline, it often gave them breathing room. Then, when prices fell, China gave a variety of industries — everything from tractor and electronics factories to ostrich breeders — the power to form cartels to stay in business.

The approach worried free-market economists. While they widely acknowledged that China couldn’t change overnight, they argued that state control hobbled the economy by pouring money into wasteful targets.

Mr. Friedman, the Nobel laureate, gave voice to those concerns when he returned to China in 1993. China’s entrepreneurs, he noted approvingly, were thriving. But everywhere, he saw the domineering presence of the Chinese government. “Not surprisingly,” he wrote later, “the managers of state-owned enterprises are not at all willing to give up their powers.”

Mr. Friedman was shocked at the scale of a government-led project to build what was in effect a new city, Pudong, across the Huangpu River from Shanghai. “A Potemkin village built for a reigning emperor,” Mr. Friedman wrote, predicting disaster.

A decade later, Pudong was one of Asia’s hottest real estate markets.

Opening and Dragging

While China was getting richer, it wasn’t enough by the end of the 1990s. It was still home to about one in five of the world’s poorest people. Inflation ping-ponged, demanding constant government attention. Beijing pushed state-owned companies to get leaner and work smarter, leading to the layoffs of millions of workers.

China needed growth. To get there, the leadership reasoned, it had to join the World Trade Organization, the premier global commerce club. Membership would mean lower tariffs for China’s manufacturers and give foreign companies the confidence to invest more in the country. Membership would also free China from the annual scrutiny that American lawmakers gave its human rights record before extending favorable trading terms.

The rest of the world expected that China would be forced to adopt greater political and economic freedoms to compete. “The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people — their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise,” President Bill Clinton said in 2000.

Casting aside wasted years of halfhearted negotiations, China launched an all-out effort to get in. It yielded on a number of demands made by the United States and others. It agreed to slash tariffs and lower trade barriers to telecommunications, the financial sector and a host of other industries. It agreed to curb subsidies.

In the bargain, China got what it wanted, paving the way for a global trading colossus.

After China’s entry in the W.T.O. in 2001, its exports doubled in three years and nearly tripled in four. Investment poured into the country. Global manufacturers moved entire operations to China, while consumers around the world got cheaper tools, toys and phones.

Membership in the World Trade Organization was expected to force China to adopt greater political and economic freedoms. Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times Baishizhou, a village within Shenzhen, has been a source of cheap housing for immigrants. Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times

“When China joined the W.T.O., I was so excited that I cried,” said Zhu Dingding, the general manager of Hangzhou Jinyuan, which makes baby shoes and other crafts.

By 2011, orders were 10 times what they had been in 2001. He made enough money to buy a car, a Volkswagen. Three apartments followed, all purchased without mortgages.

“The W.T.O. pushed my business to develop rapidly,” Mr. Zhu said. “Without the W.T.O., it would be impossible.”

But China didn’t change that much.

Beijing has kept its iron grip on critical levers of the economy. It has been slow to meet commitments to open up key parts of its financial system, while other essential areas like telecommunications remain cut off. It has continued to nurture businesses aimed at meeting its technological and political goals, like high-speed rail and solar panels. It hasn’t fully relaxed its grip on the value of the country’s currency.

China’s entry into the W.T.O. caused a systemic shock, one underestimated particularly by the United States. Cheap Chinese goods ushered in a new era of low prices, upending industries from textile mills in South Carolina to circuit board manufacturers in Japan and fashion designers in Italy. One study suggested that, between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports eliminated one million American manufacturing jobs, plus more in other industries.

“China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in the history of our country,” Donald J. Trump said at a campaign appearance in 2016, four months before he was elected president.

‘Can China Save the World?’

As the global financial system tottered in 2008, an influential Chinese leader chastised Henry M. Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary and a former Goldman Sachs executive.

The leader, Wang Qishan, was among the first Chinese officials to soak in the lessons of the free market evangelists. But he told Mr. Paulson that China had perhaps listened to the West long enough.

“You were my teacher, but now here I am in my teacher’s domain, and look at your system, Hank,” Mr. Wang said, according to Mr. Paulson. “We aren’t sure we should be learning from you anymore.”

Nobody was unscathed by the global financial crisis. Washington bailed out Wall Street and Detroit, then its efforts slowed to a crawl as a new president, Barack Obama, clashed with Congress over the size of a stimulus package. Europe also fell into squabbling as individual countries fell into crisis, creating cracks in the union.

While China withstood the initial shock, the ripples threatened to become devastating. Exports plunged and economic growth slowed as foreign markets dried up. Factories began to lay off workers. Later, economists at the World Bank would estimate that as many as 36 million Chinese workers had lost their jobs.

What followed was perhaps the greatest show of financial firepower the world has ever seen — and it wouldn’t have been possible without government controls that would have made Milton Friedman blanch.

Beijing unleashed a nearly $600 billion spending package in an effort to rev up its economy. It called for building rail lines, highways, power lines and other big infrastructure projects across the country.

Then it began to lend. The central bank flooded the country with money, and China’s economic leaders told its government-backed banks to start giving out loans. State-run companies were told to build and invest, and local government officials were told to help them. By one estimate, the financial stimulus totaled, over three years, nearly $1.4 trillion.

Asked one headline, “Can China Save the World?”

In some ways, China was well positioned for this moment. Early in its embrace of capitalism, it recognized the treasure it had in the savings of its people. Currently, their savings rate is nearly three times that of the United States — driven in part by worries that an underdeveloped social safety net won’t help them when they retire or get sick.

Because the government controlled the banking system, it could force banks to extend mercy to troubled borrowers or simply roll over their loans at more agreeable terms. It could ignore the advice of global investors and institutions, like the International Monetary Fund, that preached open markets and austerity, sometimes to disastrous results.

China also kept money from leaving the country. It put limits on how much people could move overseas and kept a tight grip on the value of its currency, the renminbi.

The contrast between China and the rest of the world was stark. Beijing moved swiftly — and its growth was the rare bright spot in the global economy. Washington didn’t complete a $787 billion stimulus package until the next year, filled with political compromises. The American economy couldn’t avoid recession.

Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told American officials in 2009 that “China is the gold standard in terms of its response to the global economic crisis.”

Testing China’s Model

More than a quarter-century after Deng Xiaoping used his southern tour to get Chinese reform back on track, Xi Jinping followed on a mission of his own.

Mr. Xi’s trip to Guangdong Province in the south last month deliberately echoed his predecessor’s. Like Deng, he visited start-ups, inspected their work and gabbed with factory employees. He visited an appliance company and an auto parts plant, praising the role of small businesses in the Chinese economy. China, he said, hadn’t wavered from its commitment to them.

“China’s reform and opening up will never stop,” Mr. Xi told a group at an exhibition center celebrating decades of reform. “The next 40 years of China will bring new achievements that will make the world take notice.”

So far, Mr. Xi’s rhetoric hasn’t matched reality. While Deng dragged the Chinese economy further out of the clutches of state control, Mr. Xi has been pulling it back.

Despite calls to rein in debt, he has kept the money flowing. Despite a push to create global technology champions, he has put the country’s vibrant internet industry under the increasing authority of the party and the state. Despite promising to lift entrepreneurs, he has strengthened state behemoths, which now account for growing shares of the country’s profits and industrial production.

Mr. Xi has made some modest reforms. He has loosened, just a bit, Beijing’s hold on the value of its currency. He moved to allow foreign banks and automakers to directly own their Chinese operations.

But the pendulum has markedly swung toward the state at a time when the cumulative weight of four decades of choices has left the Chinese economy vulnerable. Growth is slowing — and juicing it won’t be as easy.

The lending-and-spending binge that powered its economy, and arguably the world’s, after the financial crisis has saddled the country with a huge debt load. While calculating what China owes is difficult since much is off the books, debt could total $41 trillion — or three years’ worth of the country’s economic output. That’s roughly equal to developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan. But whereas their debt built up over decades, China’s accumulated in nine years.

Moving the needle has become harder. China’s economy is roughly three times the size it was in 2008. Those airport and highway projects it still uses to spur growth are expensive and deliver less economic bang.

The world has also begun to take aim at China’s pace of opening up and its global ambitions. President Trump has started a trade war over China’s economic barriers and its state-sponsored plans to build world-beating competitors in industries like semiconductors, robotics and electric cars.

The tariffs and tensions threaten a key cog in China’s trade machine: exports of goods and services, which total about one-fifth of the country’s output. The United States has also taken more forceful action against Chinese companies that it believes break the global rules of trade, in some cases depriving them of buying or investing in the American-made technology they need to survive or innovate.

And in a fundamental change, China’s leaders appear to be losing their willingness to experiment. Amid fear over slowing economic growth and difficult social problems, the party’s talk has turned to more control. Some increasingly strident voices within the Communist Party are tapping pre-reform language to lash out against Western ideas. Even private business ownership — a bedrock of Deng’s reform and opening up — has been criticized in some quarters.

China may also have become complacent. Its four decades of success under the China model may have persuaded the country’s leaders that the Communist Party, rather than the country’s entrepreneurs, drove its success, and it has little reason to let go.

“The China model concept misleads China,” said Zhang Weiying, a prominent pro-market economist, “so we’re going backward.”

China, of course, has changed course in the past. Pragmatism has often won out.

China’s leaders received a subtle reminder of that in September — from a son of Deng, the architect of reform. In a speech to top leaders, Deng Pufang praised their work but cautioned that once China’s opening had begun, it could never go back.

“Reform and opening up is the liberation of people,” he said. “It encourages the recognition of people’s desire and pursuit of a happy life, it stimulates the wisdom and strength of the masses, and it provides opportunities and platforms for every ordinary person to improve their lives and change their destiny.”","China’s economy now stands as an alternate narrative to Western ideals.

Now MIT engineers have built and flown the first-ever plane with no moving parts. Instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an “ionic wind” — a silent but mighty flow of ions that is produced aboard the plane, and that generates enough thrust to propel the plane over a sustained, steady flight.

Unlike turbine-powered planes, the aircraft does not depend on fossil fuels to fly. And unlike propeller-driven drones, the new design is completely silent.

“This is the first-ever sustained flight of a plane with no moving parts in the propulsion system,” says Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. “This has potentially opened new and unexplored possibilities for aircraft which are quieter, mechanically simpler, and do not emit combustion emissions.”

He expects that in the near-term, such ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly less noisy drones. Further out, he envisions ion propulsion paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid passenger planes and other large aircraft.

Barrett and his team at MIT have published their results today in the journal Nature.

Hobby crafts

Barrett says the inspiration for the team’s ion plane comes partly from the movie and television series, “Star Trek,” which he watched avidly as a kid. He was particularly drawn to the futuristic shuttlecrafts that effortlessly skimmed through the air, with seemingly no moving parts and hardly any noise or exhaust.

“This made me think, in the long-term future, planes shouldn’t have propellers and turbines,” Barrett says. “They should be more like the shuttles in ‘Star Trek,’ that have just a blue glow and silently glide.”

About nine years ago, Barrett started looking for ways to design a propulsion system for planes with no moving parts. He eventually came upon “ionic wind,” also known as electroaerodynamic thrust — a physical principle that was first identified in the 1920s and describes a wind, or thrust, that can be produced when a current is passed between a thin and a thick electrode. If enough voltage is applied, the air in between the electrodes can produce enough thrust to propel a small aircraft.

For years, electroaerodynamic thrust has mostly been a hobbyist’s project, and designs have for the most part been limited to small, desktop “lifters” tethered to large voltage supplies that create just enough wind for a small craft to hover briefly in the air. It was largely assumed that it would be impossible to produce enough ionic wind to propel a larger aircraft over a sustained flight.

“It was a sleepless night in a hotel when I was jet-lagged, and I was thinking about this and started searching for ways it could be done,” he recalls. “I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and found that, yes, it might become a viable propulsion system,” Barrett says. “And it turned out it needed many years of work to get from that to a first test flight.”","Now MIT engineers have built and flown the first-ever plane with no moving parts.

The tracks date back to the 19th century and are made from wood. Alejandro Ruesga

The train in Extremadura goes at three different speeds, according to actor Chema Trujillo – slow, very slow or not at all. It’s a joke from a local, but the truth is that delays, cancellations and even fires are no laughing matter. On October 13, one of the trains heading for Madrid actually ran out of gas.

The 1,072,059 people who live in the western region in Spain are tired of hearing promises that the rail network will be fixed, just as they are sick of being at the bottom of the statistics ladder. Six of the 10 poorest municipalities in Spain are in Extremadura. More than 400,000 locals live on just €700 a month and the younger generation leave as soon as they can – 13,000 of them in the last five years. Its 388 towns are eerily quiet. So what’s going on in Extremadura?

There’s been enough waiting. We want the politicians to come up with the goods

Vale Rodríguez, citizen’s platform Milana Bonita

Zahínos is the poorest town in the whole of Spain. Situated in the province of Badajoz, it smells of coal and damp leaves. The first thing you see as you enter is El Largo, one of its main watering holes. “People are paid from day to day,” says its owner Francisco Guerrero, 49. “But we have to go elsewhere to find work.”

Guerrero charges €1 for a coffee and the same for a small beer. He has no staff and no soccer package for the TV. “I did put on the Madrid-Barça match, of course,” he says. In Zahínos, the average annual income of its 2,806 residents is €10,386, less than half the national average, which is €21,360.

Poverty has gained ground in the region in the last year. According to a report from the State of Poverty in Spain, 44.3% of its inhabitants are at risk of social exclusion. In fact, it is now 25 points higher in the report’s ranking than it was before the economic crisis. Many of the locals have work but they cannot afford at least four of the nine consumer items considered basic by European standards, such as adequate heating for their homes, the ability to meet unexpected costs or a week’s annual vacation.

Zahínos local Manuel Perera, 61, has three children. One has found work away from home, the other is unemployed and the third has a debilitating illness. “I have spent all my life working in Catalonia,” he says. “Now things are looking bad.”

Another Zahínos resident, María Ángeles Sequedo, 21, failed to graduate from high school and has only worked 15 days of her life. She has seen the beach just once. “They don’t want women, not even to pick fruit,” she says. Unemployment affects 45% of young people like Sequedo. “I have a mortgage and I manage thanks to my partner,” she says. “He is paid where he can get work – €45 a day, if he’s lucky.”

The report paints a bleak picture, but the reality is not all negative. There is a broad range of cars, new businesses are opening and fiber optic internet connections are being installed in people’s homes. Jennifer Marín, 30, says, “Maybe it’s because not everything people have is registered.”

Marín studied Work Science in Badajoz and in 2016 she returned to her hometown to open a clothes store. “It’s not bad,” she says. “You don’t need much to live on here. Although it is true that most of the young people leave.”

One of the problems is the local attitude: we limit ourselves, don’t protest much and accept what comes our way

Anthropologist Javier Marcos

Last February, the regional newspaper Hoy ran with this front page: “Every month Extremadura loses 200 young people aged between 20 and 39.” In the report, it stated that more than 12,666 had left since 2012, according to the National Statistics Institute (INE). Fernando Vaca, 29, was among them. He went to London. “There was nothing here for me,” he says. Saúl Barbero, 30, from Caceres felt the same way. Now he is about to open a Telepizza in the province of Salamanca. “There isn’t much opportunity here,” he says. “In my group of friends, there are 25 of us and 20 have left. There’s just bar and restaurant work in the summer. There’s nothing more permanent.”

The Institute of Extremadura Youth describes the situation as “complicated.” According to the institute’s director general Felipe González: “It’s not the same living in a town as living in Madrid. Next year, we are announcing our sixth youth scheme with an investment of €16 million.”

Elena Ruiz, president of the Youth Council, adds: “There are no opportunities and there is no hope.” She and her team drew up a report in 2016 on the request of the regional premier, Guillermo Fernández Vara, from the Socialist Party (PSOE). The conclusion was that Extremadura was not attractive to young people. In a bid to make it more so, the report suggested developing a framework to help set up new businesses.

Nowadays, there are 66,879 businesses in the region, 976 fewer than before the economic crisis. “We are surviving,” says Francisco Javier Peinado, secretary general of the Extremadura Employers association (Crex). “But if a local young person studies and then sees there’s nothing for them, they leave. Never mind the demand for a better rail service, Caceres and Badajoz – 92 kilometers apart – are not even linked by a highway!”

From the transport unions, there are cries for state investment, but do the people of Extremadura feel they might be in any responsible for what is happening? Anthropologist Javier Marcos is one of the 20 experts from various parts of the region who produced the book, What did the people of Extremadura do to get here?. He claims: “It’s not just the fault of Madrid. One of the problems is the local attitude: we limit ourselves, don’t protest much and accept what comes our way. Nowadays, the fat cats are not in the field, they are in the regional government, the university and the banks. There’s nepotism that’s political and geographical. For decades, it’s been noted that the councils are more like family businesses than public entities.”

During the presentation of the book at the Caceres book fair, one of its editors told the Extremadura Post shared a remark made by a customer: “All of us from Extremadura want a subsidy and nobody wants to be a businessman.”

José Manuel Álvarez moved to Extremadura from Uruguay 40 years ago. Having always worked in the power sector, he decided to set up Electromercantil in 2016, which now has 60 workers. “We have the raw material but we don’t know how to exploit the skills,” he says. “The economy is linked to the young and if they leave…”

With the exodus comes the problem of depopulation – a loss of 38,000 people since 2012. Around 11,000 of them have gone abroad and no one comes to replace them – not Spaniards from other regions nor immigrants – here only 2.9% of the population is foreign, which is the lowest figure in Spain. “It is as if you had got rid of 19 small towns in one fell swoop,” says Antonio Pérez, a lecturer of Geographical Analysis at the University of Extremadura. “The future is clear. My students tell me they don’t want to stay.”

Manuel Toro, 24, is an exception. He is a journalist working in Llerena in the south of Extremadura. “I’ve stayed because I’ve found a job doing what I want to do, but I will go to Mérida or Cáceres,” he says.

Saúl Barbero, 30, from Hervás, Cáceres. Alejandro Ruesga

In Llerena, which has a population of 6,000, there’s a train line with wooden tracks from the 19th century – the oldest in Spain – linking Cáceres with Seville. “I’ve caught it more than 50 times as a student and it’s always late,” says Saúl.

The north of the region was cut off from the north of Spain in 1984 when the national rail network Renfe closed the Plasencia-Salamanca-Astorga line. What’s left is a bad connection to Madrid. Anyone living in Extremadura with a meeting in the capital travels to Madrid the night before. In the past few weeks, there have been flights from Badajoz, thanks to a regional government subsidized deal. But the flight still costs €90 each way and politicians and businessmen believe that a better train connection is what is needed to revolutionize the region and bring it more business, trade and tourism.

Currently, the trip from Badajoz to Madrid costs €51.40 and takes six hours and 37 minutes if it is on time. The same journey is just four hours by car. The Talgo train, which is back on track after eight years, is slightly faster. It takes five hours and eight minutes. That is, of course, in theory. In practice, it always arrives late because none of the region’s 725 kilometers of rail line is electric. Moreover, there’s only one line serving two directions so at some stage one train has to park in a station en route to let the other past.

Former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar promised Extremadura a high-speed AVE train in 2002. The latest on this is that it will be ready by 2025. “They are now finally getting on with it. The train that links Madrid with Badajoz will take 30 minutes less by June 2019 due to improvements,” says the region’s Transport Minister Begoña García.

Meanwhile, Vale Rodríguez, the spokesman for the citizen’s platform Milana Bonita, says: “There’s been enough waiting. We want the politicians to come up with the goods.”

A week ago, Public Works Minister José Luis Ábalos visited the region and announced new investment plans. This is the seventh time Extremadura has been promised such investment since 1981. In a gesture of solidarity, Ábalos decided to take the train back to Madrid. Naturally, that day of all days, it was on time.","Alejandro RuesgaThe train in Extremadura goes at three different speeds, according to actor Chema Trujillo – slow, very slow or not at all.

Roughly 75 per cent of refugees from Kasai in Angola are women and children.

Women and girls displaced by conflict face extraordinary hardships. Many endure grave risks, including gender-based violence, which can escalate in humanitarian settings. Most are thrust into poverty – cut off from education and life-saving health services.

Displacement exacts another huge toll on women and girls. In exile, their most intimate – and taboo – health needs are often overlooked, to devastating effect.

“I had my first period here at the settlement,” said Marie Anny, 13, whose family now lives in the Lóvua settlement, home to over 14,000 Congolese refugees. “I had no idea what was happening. For me, that day was sad and shameful.”

Stigmas surrounding menstruation have existed across cultures and history. And it’s not uncommon for women and girls to internalize these destructive myths.

A report published by UNFPA earlier this year details the extent to which period shame and misinformation reinforce gender discrimination, rendering women and girls vulnerable to poverty, violence and harmful practices.

From shame to dignity

Around the world, the idea that menstruating women and girls are unclean contributes to their exclusion not only from family life, but from education and employment. In some places, isolation and expulsion from the home can be dangerous, exposing women and girls to extreme weather and sexual violence. In others, the onset of menstruation is associated with child marriage, which heightens the risk of adolescent pregnancy and life-threatening complications before, during and after childbirth.

Displacement magnifies these afflictions.

“When I’m menstruating, I usually use strips of absorbent cloth, but in the settlement it is difficult to get this cloth,” Marie Anny told UNFPA.

The unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health services intensify

Harmful conditions in evacuation sites can wreak havoc on women’s sexual and reproductive health, while lack of access to hygiene supplies limits their mobility and heightens their vulnerability to sexual violence. Girls who do not have the ability to manage their menstrual health are also at greater risk of missing school or dropping out entirely.

Marie Anny is the recipient of one of over 8,000 UNFPA dignity kits distributed to women and girls in the Lóvua settlement. The kits contain essential hygiene items such as sanitary pads, underclothes, soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste.

UNFPA works with partners to deliver dignity kits to women and girls around the world – in schools and in women’s and girls' safe spaces. These safe spaces provide more than sexual and reproductive health services.

UNFPA-supported safe spaces also offer culturally sensitive counselling, legal support and vocational training to women and girls displaced by conflict, including victims of gender-based violence. Safe spaces can provide opportunities for women and girls to build their knowledge about other forms of sexual and reproductive health and rights as well, like HIV prevention and gender equality.

With more than 7,000 women and girls of reproductive age in the Lóvua settlement, unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health services are mounting.

For Marie Anny, the dignity kits help to keep her healthy, safe and confident.

“I take better care of my hygiene when I get the kit,” she added.

Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea -- I have covered a lot of summits.

I have battled sleep deprivation during all-night affairs in stuffy Brussels buildings as EU leaders scrambled to salvage the euro during the Greek debt crisis.

I have hob-nobbed at swanky gatherings in the snowy mountains of Davos as presidents, prime ministers and business tycoons put the world to rights over champagne and canapes.

More recently, I watched locals struggle to hold back the tears at a summit between the leaders of North and South Korea and, just a few months after that, the historic moment Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un clasped hands in Singapore.

But none of this could have prepared me for the absolutely unique experience that was the recent APEC summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea.

Let's start with our digs.

A sizeable chunk of Port Moresby's poverty-hit population lives in ramshackle slums, scratching out whatever living they can. There's not much call for luxury hotels.

In addition, the dusty and sun-baked capital has acquired a reputation for lawlessness, with reports of the feared machete-wielding ""raskol"" street gangs mugging and beating people at random and carrying out frequent carjackings.

For these two reasons, journalists and delegates were housed not in the standard summit business hotel but on three colossal cruise ships moored in the bay.

""Like No Place On Earth"" was the company motto and the full range of cruise facilities was available onboard: from the quoits deck to blackjack and roulette at the ""Players"" casino.

After a stressful day at the summit, attendees could choose between three sauna and steam rooms or splash in the jacuzzis and plunge pools up on the sun deck.

Evenings were generally spent in one of the many restaurants -- mainly the copious buffet as it was free -- followed by a nightcap in ""Connections"" or the ""Orient"" bar, complete with live music that ranged from chilled-out jazz to a band loudly belting out ""Hotel California.""

It may sound nice but we did sometimes feel like we could check out any time we liked, but we could never leave.

This picture taken on November 13, 2018 shows people on the deck of the cruise ship Pacific Jewels, which will accommodate delegates and journalists at this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, in Port Moresby. (AFP / Saeed Khan)

We were instructed that under no circumstances should we venture out alone -- especially after dark.

One of the great joys of summitry is when the work is done and the team heads out to sample local restaurants and bars, usually under the experienced guidance of the local AFP bureau chief.

But Port Moresby is one of only a handful of capitals where AFP does not have any presence at all so the summit was an endless series of shuttling between the Pacific Jewel ship and the city's Aquatic centre which served as the press room for the international media.

'Direct bus, sir?'

That's if you could get there.

The APEC summit was Papua New Guinea's debut on the international stage and it visibly struggled with the logistics of hosting delegates from more than 21 countries plus the world's media.

Much of the talk in the run-up to the summit surrounded the purchase of 40 Maserati luxury saloons to ferry around world leaders and the resulting cost to a city where tens of thousands live hand-to-mouth.

(AFP / Saeed Khan) But despite throwing money at the situation, transport snafus seemed commonplace. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was kept in his car for more than five minutes waiting for the summit host Peter O'Neill to arrive. I'm based in Tokyo and let me tell you that the Japanese don't wait that amount of time for a metro, never mind a delay to the PM. PNG authorities were proud of their shiny new buses -- funded by China -- to transport journalists and delegates seamlessly around the city but numerous delays and problems were reported.

At one point, a shuttle bus ""direct to the press centre"" took the AFP team to the parliament building and then on to the national museum. Only by begging the driver was it prevented from then going to the airport.

We finally got on our way -- despite leaving more than two hours ahead of time to get to an interview, we were in serious danger of being late -- when we sped too quickly down a hill and obliterated the front of the bus.

The result: more than an hour and a half to travel about five kilometres.

Another ""direct bus to the press centre"" just took me next door to the neighbouring cruise ship and then back again.

It wasn't just transport. Small details that are run-of-the-mill for experienced summit hosts proved tricky for the PNG novices.

The ""family photo"" of the leaders was delayed when one delegation realised there was no lighting for the photographers and it was pitch black. Cue a mad scramble around the hotel which eventually unearthed a temporary light but the pictures were still far from perfect.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Chile's President Sebastian Pinera, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, US Vice President Mike Pence, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and others pose for a family photo during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Port Moresby on November 17, 2018.

(AFP / Saeed Khan)

Then just minutes before a signing ceremony involving US Vice President Mike Pence, one eagle-eyed PNG official noticed that their own flag was upside down.

This turns out to be the international symbol for a country in distress, which was particularly unfortunate as the ceremony was about bringing electricity to millions in PNG who live without power.

PNG Aid

But if the summit proved to be a logistic uphill battle, the frustration was eased by the people of Port Moresby who were employed in their thousands to help things run -- well, less roughly.

Summit helpers were unfailingly kind, friendly and smiling -- even when faced with furious journalists shouting at them because the internet crashed two minutes into Pence's keynote speech.

But the real gem of the summit was not found in the sterile gym hall of the international media centre.

Without a bureau in Port Moresby -- AFP covers the country from Sydney -- this was a golden opportunity to tell stories from a rarely visited dateline.

So AFP teams ventured out -- with a local driver and ""fixer"" -- in an attempt to report on the real Port Moresby, which seemed a million nautical miles from the summit.

We visited markets, settlements, and shopping malls. We spoke to minority groups, housewives and passers-by who gave us a short burst of their tribal tongue on camera for a feature on the more than 800 languages in Papua New Guinea.

Everywhere we went, we were greeted with genuine warmth. Crowds would form immediately as locals could not believe the international media could be interested in them -- little did they know they were in fact the most interesting part of the summit.

And despite the doomsday warnings, at no stage did I feel threatened or unsafe. Admittedly we didn't hit the streets after sunset but I have felt more on edge wandering around parts of Paris or my native London at night.

Instead, we encountered grinning locals, their teeth stained red from constant munching of betel nut -- an omnipresent narcotic banned in most countries -- who told us they wanted to see some of the benefits of the APEC trickle down to them in their tough lives.

We visited a rickety settlement consisting of thousands of dwellings perched on stilts far out into the sea, with precarious wooden planks serving as ""streets"" and a caged pig outside almost every hut.

You don't get that at an EU summit or G20.

When our bus broke down at the museum, who should come to our rescue but a local flower-seller, who bundled us, our copious video equipment, and a bemused Chinese journalist who was also stranded into her truck and gave us a lift. When the China Aid bus failed, PNG aid stepped up and we made our interview with minutes to spare.

And when the memories of the logistical snafus have long blended into the memories of a dozen other summits, it is the warmth from the PNG people that will endure.

I have covered a lot of summits. But none quite like the Port Moresby APEC and I doubt any of us ever will.

The conflict between pro-government forces and non-state armed groups (NSAGs) is the first and foremost driver of hunger across the country. According to reporting by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, as of May 2018, the Afghan government controls approximately 56.3% of Afghanistan’s districts (totalling 229 districts). The remaining districts – totalling 178 – are either under the control of or contested by NSAGs.9 The conflict both creates the conditions for and compounds wide-spread poverty, lack of sustainable livelihood opportunities, poor infrastructure and a lack of access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation and healthcare – ultimately driving a lack of access to and poor utilization of food as well as deepening under-development. As stated by OCHA in its Humanitarian Needs Overview, “the most severe needs are found in provinces experiencing ongoing conflict or hosting large numbers of IDPs and returnees. These areas are simultaneously affected by structural deficits predating the current crisis and include chronic food insecurity, malnutrition and limited access to safe water and healthcare.”

Across the country, approximately 9.8 million people face severe acute food insecurity (IPC phase 3 and phase 4) with an estimated 2.6 million people who are classified as facing emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 4 - Emergency). This corresponds to a 17.4% increase compared to the previous analysis in 2017. According to the last nationwide nutritional survey, approximately 10% of children suffer from wasting (low weight for height) and approximately 41% suffer from stunting (low height for age) indicative of widespread chronic malnutrition. However, recent SMART surveys conducted by ACF at a provincial level indicate that the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition is much higher.

At the heart of this current food security crisis are two main drivers: conflict and drought, both having led, and continuing to lead, to significant waves of displacement. While conflict is a significant driver of this deteriorating situation, it is increasingly recognized that natural disasters, and in particular drought, have profound impacts on the food security of the Afghan population. Due to the 2018 drought, on the 2.2 millions already chronically food insecure farming households, 1.4 million will become acutely food insecure and require emergency assistance over the coming months and into the next lean season. Despite being a chronical issue, drought-related requirements were only incorporated in the revised Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) in May 2018, increasing by 27% the financial requirements on the original appeal.

The humanitarian response system must be systematically driven by the severity of needs. However, the drivers of hunger in Afghanistan cannot be adequately addressed through emergency response alone. A collective response that prioritises the needs of the population and addresses the vulnerabilities across the Humanitarian-Development Nexus and its link to peace is urgently required. Billions of dollars are being invested in Afghanistan ($15.2 billion from 2016-2020 following Brussels conference). Whilst such long-term investments continue to be needed, Afghanistan’s progress continues to be undermined by instability, displacement and chronic unmet humanitarian needs. The aid system must direct its effort to address the gap between humanitarian and development actors to provide early recovery and resilience programmes.","As stated by OCHA in its Humanitarian Needs Overview, “the most severe needs are found in provinces experiencing ongoing conflict or hosting large numbers of IDPs and returnees.

It has also provided satellite information on what to target and “elite U.S. forces” to work with the Saudis. (Wall Street Journal, June 12) The immense humanitarian disaster this caused has brought criticism of the U.S. role. This Nov. 11, the Saudi-led coalition of Gulf monarchies — upon hearing that the U.S. would stop the refueling — has said the coalition will do it themselves.

This is just the latest sign of problems between Washington and Riyad. Others include a scandal over the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and Saudi citizen killed Oct. 2 in the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul, which has been condemned by the Turkish government. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia still collaborate on economic and military maneuvers aimed against Iran.

The article below, which first appeared in the Nov. 7 edition of the progressive German publication Junge Welt, gives more detail on the suffering Riyad continues to impose on the Yemeni people. Translation is by WW Managing Editor John Catalinotto.

Nov. 7 — This week, as before, the war in Yemen is not on the agenda of the U.N. Security Council. At the internet portal Relief Web, an information service of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the war-torn country only makes it to sixth place on the “hit list” of international crises and disasters.

According to UNICEF Regional Director Geert Cappelaere, Yemen is a “hell for children.” At a press conference of the U.N. Children’s Fund in Amman last Sunday, Cappelaere recalled the 7-year-old girl Amal Hussein, to whom the New York Times had previously dedicated a cover story. Amal died of malnutrition on Nov. 1.

In the last days before her death, the child had been fed in an infirmary, but could no longer keep down any food. To make room for other patients, Amal was discharged from the clinic and her parents were advised to take her to an aid organization 15 kilometers away. But the parents brought the child home to a straw hut in a refugee camp. They had no money for the trip.

Every year 30,000 children die because they do not get enough to eat; due to malnutrition they are also susceptible to diseases, said Cappelaere. There is not just one Amal in Yemen, “there are many thousands.”

In Yemen, 1.8 million children suffer acute malnutrition and 400,000 face death daily. Forty percent of them live in the province of Hodeida and in neighbouring regions, where the war is raging at its worst. According to the UNICEF coordinator, only one hospital is still in operation there. The Al-Thawra hospital is less than two kilometers (1.24 miles) from the front.

The city of Hodeida, in the west of the country on the Red Sea, is the only port for bringing relief supplies to Yemen. According to Cappelaere, up to 80 percent of the Yemeni population of around 25 million depend on this port. An attack on Hodeida, as planned for a long time by the Saudi-led war alliance, would stop all aid deliveries to the country’s war zones.

Not only are the children suffering. Eight million people are dependent on emergency aid, according to the U.N. emergency aid program OCHA. This figure could quickly rise to 14 million if the war is not stopped soon. But a ceasefire would not be enough — Yemen would need a comprehensive aid program for reconstruction.

People weakened by hunger also lack health care, sanitation and clean water. Since 2016, the number of cholera cases in Yemen has increased dramatically.

According to OCHA, 3 million internally displaced people live mostly in poorly equipped camps. According to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, some 900,000 people have returned to their original homes despite being damaged or destroyed and uninhabitable.

Yemen is regarded as the poorhouse of the Arab world. Hunger has been part of everyday life for decades, especially for the rural areas, which are home to around 80 percent of the population.

Since 1990, the country has been at the lower end of the Human Development Index. The HDI assesses three central achievements of human existence: a long, healthy life; access to education; and a good standard of living. In the United Nations Report on Poverty, at the botto of the list are Yemen and African states. More than 20 percent of those under 25 years of age can neither read nor write, and more than 60 percent of the population live below the poverty line.

Around 10,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the war in 2015 and around 40,000 injured. Attacks by the Saudi war alliance have repeatedly bombed civilian assemblies such as weddings, funerals, school trips and markets. Dozens of people — all civilians — were often killed on the spot.

The move is legally questionable, and civil rights groups quickly sued to stop it. On Monday night, a federal judge issued a temporary nationwide restraining order barring enforcement of the new policy, saying it likely violated federal law. The federal asylum statute specifically says that anyone who arrives in the United States “whether or not at a designated port of arrival…may apply for asylum.” The president’s proclamation attempts to use another provision of immigration law to override this requirement—the same section he used to ban most citizens of five Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The temporary restraining order will remain in effect until Dec. 19, when the court will hear arguments for and against a permanent order.

The proclamation states that the prospect of members of large caravans of migrants entering illegally between ports of entry “is contrary to the national interest,” and “puts lives of both law enforcement and aliens at risk. By contrast, entry at ports of entry at the southern border allows for orderly processing.”

But even as it tells asylum-seekers they must go to a port of entry, the Trump administration has been turning them away from these very same ports for months, claiming that they are “at capacity.” According to both immigration lawyers and a report from the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this has led some migrants to attempt crossing unlawfully.

DHS claims on its website that it is a “myth” that it has turned away asylum-seekers at ports of entry, and in fact “CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes all aliens arriving at all ports of entry without documents as expeditiously as possible…. As the number of arriving aliens determined to be inadmissible at ports of entry continues to rise, CBP must prioritize its limited resources to ensure its primary mission is being executed.”

Based on an investigation by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO)—including a review of recent court documents, government reports and statistics, and interviews—DHS’s claim is disingenuous at best. The evidence shows that the increasing wait times at ports of entry are not a function of a sudden surge of migrants, but of deliberate policy decisions by the Trump Administration to detain as many asylum seekers as possible for as long as possible.

The cumulative impact of the administration’s policies and practices is to leave migrants fleeing extreme violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador—including a large and growing number of families with young children—trapped in vulnerable situations on the Mexican side of the border, where crime and corruption are rife.

Turned Away, Prosecuted and Separated

Human rights groups and immigration lawyers began documenting cases of asylum-seekers being turned away from the San Ysidro port of entry, between San Diego and Tijuana, in 2016. In July 2017, asylum-seekers who had been turned away from the San Ysidro and Laredo, Texas ports filed a class-action lawsuit against DHS, Al Otro Lado v. Nielsen. They alleged that CBP was “violating the law by utilizing various tactics—including misrepresentations, threats and intimidation, verbal abuse and physical force, and coercion” to prevent people from seeking asylum at ports of entry.

It was in May and June of 2018, though, that turn-backs became visible across the entire U.S.-Mexico border—around the same time that the Trump administration started separating parents from their children. CBP officers began stationing themselves at the international boundary between the U.S. and Mexico and checking migrants’ travel documents. Asylum-seekers were told that the ports were “at capacity,” and they would have to wait. The lines quickly backed up. Families spent days or weeks camped outside, relying on volunteers to provide food, water, and other necessities. In some cases, they waited on bridges without toilet facilities, where temperatures sometimes reached 100 degrees.

Taylor Levy, the legal coordinator for a shelter serving migrants in El Paso, emailed POGO on June 5 that “Everything is awful. Refusing to accept Asylum Seekers at the POEs [ports of entry] funnels them to EWI [entry without inspection], which leads to the government-sanctioned kidnapping of their children.”

Levy later submitted a court declaration describing how she witnessed CBP agents turn away asylum-seekers at a pedestrian bridge in El Paso. Levy said she heard CBP agents and supervisors give the following explanations:

“We have orders not to let anybody in. As soon as we have room, yea.” “We have an order.” “This is a policy across the border.” “There is no room for them right now. You can wait in line. Once there is room they can come in.” “They can wait until we have room for them.” “It’s an order from [then-Attorney General Jeff] Sessions.”

Annunciation House, the shelter where Levy works, housed a number of separated parents after their release from government custody. She wrote in her declaration that “[m]any of these parents report that it was only when they had been turned away at the port of entry—sometimes multiple times—that they attempted to cross elsewhere and were prosecuted for unlawful entry.”

Levy described interviewing two specific parents—a Honduran father and a Guatemalan mother—who had been charged with illegal entry and separated from their three-year-old children after repeatedly trying to seek asylum at ports of entry and being turned away. She concluded, “I simply cannot believe that my government could have done this to these people.”

Michael Seifert, a strategist for the ACLU of Texas based in the Rio Grande Valley, also told POGO that the turn-backs in Brownsville started at around the same time as the “zero tolerance” prosecution policy that was used to separate families. By late May and early June, people were waiting on the bridges for up to six day. This included children. Others gave up and tried to cross the river. The “administration told them to come the right way, but they couldn’t,” Seifert said.

Seifert’s and Levy’s descriptions are consistent with a report released this October by DHS’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG). OIG inspectors found that even as officials encouraged families seeking asylum to enter through ports of entry to avoid separation, CBP agents were blocking access to the ports through a process they called “metering,” leading more people to cross illegally. A Border Patrol supervisor had acknowledged to OIG inspectors that “the Border Patrol sees an increase in illegal entries when aliens are metered at ports of entry,” and three asylum-seekers described crossing illegally only after being turned away from ports of entry.

In a written response to the OIG report, DHS acknowledged having taken “operational actions to manage the flow of asylum-seekers at Ports of Entry through the process known as ‘queue management,’” which was “undergoing pilot evaluation as directed by the Secretary of Homeland Security” in June. DHS claimed, though, that family separation and “queue management” were “separate and distinct,” and discussing them together “detracts from an accurate understanding of either issue.”

DHS’s press office did not respond to requests for details about this “queue management” pilot program, nor did DHS provide additional information about it to OIG investigators. Arlen Morales, a spokesperson for OIG’s public affairs office, wrote in an email to POGO that DHS’s written response “was the first and only time they told us” about a pilot.

She continued, “To the best of our knowledge, metering has been used on and off for a couple years. However, we do not know the details of the prior metering, such as whether it took the same form of officers standing in the middle of the bridge. Nor do we know why CBP decided to reinitiate metering when it did in 2018.”

A Dangerous Limbo at the Border

After Trump ended family separations in response to public outcry, the lines outside some ports of entry shortened or disappeared for a time, but immigration attorneys began to see disturbing new tactics to deny asylum-seekers access.

In the Rio Grande Valley, lawyers say, Mexican immigration officials began removing migrants from the bridges at CBP’s request. A petition filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in October by attorney Rochelle Garza alleges that starting in late June 2018, “for the first time ever, Mexican immigration officials…were stationed at the entryway to Mexico-Texas international bridges, demanding identification or Mexican visas from all persons seeking to cross the bridges.” Asylum-seekers who had visas to be present in Mexico were allowed to enter. Those who did not “were apprehended and detained, then either deported or warned never to return.”

An amended complaint filed last month in the Al Otro Lado case alleges that this September and October, Mexican immigration officials forced four of the plaintiffs off a pedestrian bridge at the Hidalgo-Reynosa port of entry, briefly detained them, and threatened them with deportation from Mexico. (According to one of their attorneys, Angelo Guisado of the Center for Constitutional Rights, all but one of the plaintiffs named in the case have been allowed to enter the United States since the complaint was filed.)

One of the Al Otro Lado plaintiffs, whom the complaint calls “Maria Doe,” is a Guatemalan citizen with legal permanent residence in Mexico. She and her children fled her abusive husband, who was affiliated with a drug cartel. The family was turned away from the Laredo port of entry on September 10, and then attempted to cross at the Reynosa-Hidalgo port accompanied by an American lawyer. Mexican officials forced them off the bridge twice, and threatened to destroy Maria’s identity documents and revoke her permanent residency in Mexico.

Asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico also face the threat of violence and kidnapping by gangs and cartels. The situation is particularly bad in the Rio Grande Valley. The U.S. State Department has issued a “do not travel” warning for the Mexican state of Tamaulipas—the same warning it issues for countries that are active war zones. The State Department urges U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel” to most other Mexican border states. Cartels often specifically target migrants for kidnapping, demanding ransom from family members. Migrants who cannot pay are sometimes killed. Notoriously, the Zetas cartel massacred 72 migrants in San Fernando, Tamaulipas in 2010, and at least 193 bodies were found in mass graves in the same city in 2011.

Tijuana is less dangerous than the Rio Grande Valley, but the wait at the port of entry can be even longer—up to four or five weeks. Asylum-seekers are placed on an informal waiting list that is kept in a notebook, which is managed by asylum-seekers in coordination with Mexican immigration officials. Two of the Al Otro Lado plaintiffs were handed pieces of paper with the numbers 919 and 1013 on them, and told those were their numbers on the list. Guisado, the attorney, described migrants’ situations outside the San Diego port as ranging from “tenuous to harrowing.” There are shelters, but male and female family members cannot stay together there, and “cartels monitor who go in and out of a shelter,” Guisado said.

In an interview at the end of August, Joanna Williams, the director of the Kino Border Initiative, said that since mid-July the wait times outside the port of entry in Nogales, Arizona had shortened considerably. But the lines started growing again the week of our interview, and by early October, Williams told the Arizona Republic that they had reached three weeks: “We’ve had maybe one or two families processed max a day. And almost all of last week, there was not a single family processed.” This was in contrast to early August, when CBP was processing 10 to 15 families a day.

Delays have only increased at ports all along the border this fall.

Near El Paso, approximately 100 migrants were camped out on the Paso del Norte bridge as of early November waiting to be processed. Mexican authorities recently removed them to a shelter at CBP’s request.

Kennji Kizuka, a researcher for Human Rights First, tweeted on November 8 that CBP was “allowing only 3 asylum seekers daily into Calexico port,” while over 200 waited in shelters on the Mexican side of the border. His colleague Alyssa Isidoridy said that at the San Luis port, near Yuma, Arizona, about 50 families were camped out in makeshift tents, and CBP was processing only one or two families a day.

Kizuka and Isidoridy encountered sick children at both ports: a four year old who began vomiting while researchers interviewed his mother near Calexico, and a nine-month-old infant with bronchitis at San Luis.

These delays were occurring before the president’s new proclamation went into effect, when the large, well-publicized migrant caravans were hundreds of miles from any port. The lines are likely to increase dramatically in the weeks ahead.

Lack of Capacity, or a Slow Lane for Seeking Refuge?

A CBP spokesperson emailed a statement to POGO that read:

“CBP processes undocumented persons as expeditiously as possible without negating the agency’s overall mission, or compromising the safety of individuals within our custody…. No one is being denied the opportunity to make a claim of credible fear or seek asylum.”

CBP did not respond to multiple follow-up inquiries.

Immigration advocates are extremely skeptical of DHS’s claims of lack of capacity. Taylor Levy, the attorney from El Paso, wrote in her court declaration that “it was especially infuriating to be told by the agents that there was no space to process these people when I knew personally from my work with Annunciation House that this was simply not true.”

Michael Seifert said that when he and his colleagues in the Rio Grande Valley ask DHS for an explanation for the delays in processing asylum-seekers, they generally “don’t answer the phone.” When they did speak to agents, Seifert said, the response was “ping pong,” where officials at the ports attributed the delays to policies from Washington, D.C., and officials in Washington blamed local conditions at the ports of entry on the border.

Joanna Williams said she received shifting explanations for lines at the port of entry in Nogales. Officers had said that the Nogales port was understaffed and needed to devote more resources to drug seizures. At other times, CBP attributed the delay to a lack of space in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities, but “ICE has claimed the opposite” and said the delays were due to CBP. “The two agencies are pointing fingers at each other,” Williams said. It is clear to her, though, that “they don’t see asylum-seekers as as high of a priority” as in the past.

DHS statistics do not show any sudden increase in people coming to ports of entry without documents that could explain the long lines on the bridges that started this May. In fiscal year 2018 (from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018), a total of 124,511 inadmissible individuals were processed at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. This was only a small increase from the 111,275 processed in fiscal year 2017 and the 114,727 processed in fiscal year 2015, and was lower than the 151,562 who came through the ports of entry in 2016. There was also no evidence of a surge in inadmissibles in May and June of 2018 that would explain DHS’s decision to pilot-test “metering” across the southwest border; in fact, there was a decrease from the months immediately before.

It is possible that a large group of asylum-seekers simultaneously arriving at a single port, which would not necessarily be apparent in monthly statistics, could cause temporary capacity issues. But that would not explain the sustained, border-wide delays in processing that attorneys have routinely observed.

It is also important to note that asylum seekers are, and have always been, a small fraction of total traffic at U.S. ports of entry. For example, San Ysidro, according to the General Services Administration, “is the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere,” and processes “an average of 70,000 northbound vehicle passengers and 20,000 northbound pedestrians per day.” CBP has been accepting between 40 and 100 asylum seekers daily for processing according to recent press reports.

If there is not a dramatic influx at the ports of entry, what explains increasing delays for asylum seekers? Two government reports suggest one potential issue may be that the holding cells at ports of entry are full—and they are full more often because of the Trump administration’s changes to immigration enforcement.

The Inspector General’s report on family separation said that OIG “did not observe CBP turning away asylum-seekers while there was available space,” and noted that there was “limited” detention capacity, especially for families and children, at the ports. OIG found that “[d]epending on who is being held on a given day and the configuration of the hold rooms, the facility can reach capacity relatively quickly. At one port of entry the OIG team visited, CBP staff attempted to increase their capacity by converting former offices into makeshift hold rooms.”

A Congressional delegation that visited the Brownsville-Matamoros port of entry also noted the use of offices as holding cells. CBP officers told Congressional staff that “they are processing legal asylum claims as quickly as ICE…can pick up the individuals or families,” but “[i]f the Port cannot transfer the individual or family, then the line quickly backs up.”

DHS generally detains individuals fleeing persecution at least until they pass an initial interview by an asylum officer, known as a “credible fear” screening. Asylum seekers are first detained by CBP in either holding cells located at ports of entry (if they come to a port), or border patrol stations (if they turn themselves in to or are caught by the border patrol), and then transferred to longer-term detention facilities operated by ICE.

As a result of the Trump administration’s opposition to “catch and release,” ICE is detaining more people than ever before, including an increasing number of asylum seekers. The agency reported to Congress in October that it was detaining an average of 44,631 people per day—about 10,000 more than was typical during the last fiscal year of the Obama administration. The U.S. government is also detaining a record number of unaccompanied migrant children in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) because of policy changes that have slowed releases from shelters. According to the New York Times, the number of migrant children in shelters quintupled over the last year, to over 13,000 as of September 30.

As HHS shelters and ICE detention centers have filled, CBP has held people in its custody for longer and longer periods before transferring them. CBP detention cells, whether they are located at ports of entry or at border patrol stations, are not designed to hold people overnight. Most are either concrete boxes or chain link cages, with no furniture other than concrete, metal, or wooden benches. Detainees commonly call the CBP cells “hieleras,” meaning freezers, or “perreras,” meaning dog kennels. Medical care is minimal or nonexistent, and detainees do not receive sleeping mats or bedding other than a mylar blanket.

CBP policy states that detainees should “generally not be held for longer than 72 hours in CBP hold rooms” or detention facilities. For minors, this limit is legally binding—but the OIG report found that it was repeatedly violated while family separations were in effect. OIG documented at least 564 cases in the Rio Grande Valley and 297 cases in El Paso where children were held in Border Patrol custody for longer than 72 hours, and one case where the Border Patrol detained a child for 25 days.

Immigration advocates have also observed an increase in the time their clients spend in hieleras more recently, including parents with children. Kennji Kizuka, the Human Rights First researcher, emailed POGO that he had interviewed four fathers at an ICE family detention center who had been held with their children in hieleras for five to 10 days in mid-September. Similarly, an Arizona newspaper reported that advocates in a Tucson shelter were receiving families who had been in Border Patrol detention for 10 days. Local 1929 Border Patrol Union in El Paso told a news station that their detention facilities were holding three times the number of detainees they were meant to, contributing to outbreaks of chicken pox and other diseases.

But while DHS’s hard-line detention policies are leading to real overcrowding, turning asylum-seekers away from ports of entry does not solve the problem. Based on the reports referenced above, Border Patrol detention facilities seem to be at least as crowded as CBP holding cells near ports of entry. More asylum-seekers cross the border than present themselves at ports, and are processed into the same ICE detention facilities (for adults) and shelters (for unaccompanied minors).

The Trump administration acknowledges that its new restrictions on asylum are likely to increase the backlog at ports of entry. According to regulations issued with the proclamation, “aliens would likely face increased wait times at a U.S. port of entry, meaning that they would spend more time in Mexico.” The regulations state that Central Americans “appear highly unlikely to be persecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in Mexico,” and therefore it is reasonable for them “to be subject to orderly processing at ports of entry that takes into account resource constraints at ports of entry and in U.S. detention facilities.”

The government does not acknowledge that the resource constraints on processing are, to a large extent, created by the government’s own detention policy. Nor does the Trump administration recognize the likelihood that migrants will face harsh or inhumane conditions as they wait for “orderly processing.” It cites no evidence for its claim that Hondurans, El Salvadorans and Guatemalans can safely wait in Mexico. It does not address the travel warnings the U.S. government has issued for Mexican border regions or the evidence that migrants are particular targets for cartels in those areas.

The large caravan that began in mid-October in Honduras traveled to Tijuana rather than the much closer ports in Tamaulipas to avoid being targeted by cartels. At press time, they were still arriving, to a city whose shelters were already over capacity. City officials opened an emergency shelter in a local sports complex with mattresses for 360 people, but some members of the caravan camped out on a beach near the border on the night of Wednesday, November 14. They were surrounded by Tijuana residents chanting for them to leave, including members of a vigilante group that is organizing and making violent threats on social media. Another group of anti-migrant demonstrators confronted riot police guarding the city’s emergency shelter on November 18. Meanwhile, the waiting list to apply for asylum at San Ysidro has reportedly grown to 3,000 people.

The sign is part of a campaign by a group called Citizens for Transparency to shed light on the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a hate group that has been behind several recent legal campaigns to limit protections for LGBTQ people.

The billboard directs people to NoGays.org, a website that gives information about ADF’s agenda, which includes fighting anti-discrimination laws, supporting conversion therapy, and promoting the myth that allowing transgender people to use the appropriate restroom will lead to violence against women.

Alliance Defending Freedom is perhaps best known for their work in Masterpiece Cakeshop, but they have also been involved in numerous other cases, always on the side of limiting LGBTQ protections and equality. They have even gone so far as to defend a homeless shelter that wanted a religious exemption to turn away transgender people.

“We want to remind people that there are still really insidious forces at work against our community,” said Caleb Cade, a spokesperson for Citizens for Transparency.

“ADF has been leading that war for a long time, with tens of millions of dollars to do it.”

ADF senior counsel Jeremy Tedesco said Citizens for Transparency is promoting “false claims.”

“ADF is not litigating any cases, pursuing any legislation, nor supporting the passage of any laws domestically or internationally that criminalize sodomy,” Tedesco said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, though, says that ADF has in fact supported sodomy laws, in Jamaica, Belize, and the U.S.

ADF submitted a brief in favor of sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court case that ultimately nullified the anti-gay laws in the U.S.

“There is no fundamental right ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and traditions’ to engage in same-sex sodomy,” the brief said.","A billboard that says “NO GAYS ALLOWED” was put up in Times Square in New York City.

Ninguém solta a mão de ninguém – no one let go of anyone’s hand.

This was one of the most repeated phrases after the victory of Jair Bolsonaro, the fascist candidate with a military background who ran for the Presidency of Brazil.

This is the spirit, we take care of each other, we fight, we resist.

But how did we we get here? The election of Bolsonaro was not via a democratic process where a whole country just decided one day to elect a person who defends torture and rape, who is racist and homophobic, to just name a few of his characteristics.

This is the continuation of the destruction of our democracy under a coup process that started in 2016 with the removal of Dilma Rousseff from the presidency, based on an impeachment process which lacked any real evidence of wrongdoing by her.

Another thing we need to keep in mind in relationship to Brazil’s democracy, is that it is a very young one. I am older than Brazil’s democracy. The normal in Brazil is to be under very oppressive and unequal systems.

Brazil is one of the most violent countries in the world with 62,000 homicides in 2016. Some 76 percent of these murders were committed against black and brown people. Every two hours a woman is murdered in Brazil. Every 19 hours a LGBTQ person is either murdered or commits suicide because of homophobia.

This violence has always existed, but it did grow a lot since the coup, like 30 percent growth for crimes against LGBTQ people since 2016. Violence is one of the main things Brazilians are concerned about, although there is a lot of misinformation related to what generates violence, what promotes violence and how you can stop violence.

Another important class relationship in Brazil is the slavery mentality that exists in the country. We still have many cases of exploitation of poor people, in the farm fields, in factories, construction jobs and domestic workers, just to name a few.

We are also a country that is very misogynistic, homophobic and racist.

Brazil is a country where a set of families controls big pieces of land, controls big media outlets and are also in political positions such as mayor, governor, senator, minister and so on.

Since our first elections for presidency in 1989, the election process has been manipulated and controlled by these families. The final debate before election day in 1989 was not broadcast live by Globo (the media monopoly in Brazil) because they had to show the last episode of the novela. Instead they showed an edited version the next day where they completely favored their candidate, Fernando Collor de Melo, who was very much like Bolsonaro

Since it was born, the Workers Party has always been attacked by the big media in Brazil which spreads what people now call “fake news.” At one time you had fake news in the format of print, then radio, then television, now we have the social media format. Or the WhatsApp format. Whatever format you choose, let’s make it clear, this is not new, the corporations that control the means of communication and serve the big capital interest, have always manipulated the news.

These forces has always retained power in Brazil and are very strong and present in the country. That is why in 2003 when Lula won, he wrote the “Letter to the Brazilian people” where he pretty much was “calming down the market,” saying the Workers Party would not take the radical or too much of a ‘”left” route. It would govern for all, build a coalition.

And they did, Lula’s two mandates moved over 50 million out of extreme poverty, empowered Brazilian national industry, education, healthcare, housing, economy and gave a lot of money to the rich as well. Lula left his second mandate with over 85 percent approval, there has never been any president in the world that managed to leave a second mandate with such an approval rate. This was in 2010!

So how come 85 percent of a country goes from supporting Lula and of course his party, to completely rejecting it and electing someone like Bolsonaro?

How do you change millions of opinions? The media in Brazil played a very important role in that. When Dilma became president, she was very different from Lula and very distant from the base. Not entirely her fault, this was already something the whole Workers Party was doing since they took power.

The PT made a lot of mistakes while “trying to govern for all” and trying to “please everyone.” There were also a lot of things that influenced this crisis, such as how the oil price went down starting in 2013 (something that affected other countries that the U.S. competed to control like Venezuela). There was the Economic crisis, a social crisis with the protests against the World Cup and transportation hikes. And all of these crises came with an intense attack from the media saying it was all the Workers Party’s fault. Yes, there was some fault, but their goal here was to start removing the Workers Party from the political scene, because no matter what they did, the PT kept electing presidents.

And that was what happened when Dilma got re-elected in 2014-15.

After the re-election, the corruption cases under Judge Moro’s Car Wash investigation started to be used as a mechanism to stop the Workers Party by whatever means necessary. Dilma was impeached and a right wing base start to take the streets again. Violence started to grow, hate and political violence especially.

The government institutions became weak, bending themselves to execute completely unethical actions in order to maintain the coup and therefore the power under the control of those who always had it. I am talking about those running the Judiciary, the so called “Market,” right wing forces like parties and other groups, the police and the military and religious groups mainly composed of evangelicals.

We are not in a democracy, we are under a coup process controlled by these people. And they knew that if Lula was going to be a candidate for president, he would have won in the first round. And that is why Judge Moro went out of his way to keep him in jail.

Most of the country associates Lula with prosperity. His mandates did not have the same level of crisis as Dilma’s, and the economy was indeed much better. Lula is also very different from any other leader, he is a person apart from the Workers Party. So, yes, if he was in the running he would win easily. Even if he had to do his campaign from jail.

And that is why they not only put him in jail without any evidence of corruption against him, but also denied his right to run as a candidate. A right that is guaranteed by an agreement Brazil signed with the UN . And which the UN did call to Brazil’s attention to, saying that if the judiciary didn’t let Lula run as a candidate, Brazil would be disrespecting the international agreement and therefore could face charges on international courts. The judiciary went ahead and blocked Lula anyways.

And that was when the Workers Party started the Haddad and Manuela campaign. Haddad was Lula’s vice presidential candidate. He is a teacher and used to be Sao Paulo’s mayor; he received awards from all around the world for his management of the city. He also was Lula’s minister of education and the one that built more schools and universities than any other government in Brazil’s history. Manuela comes from the student movement, she is from the Communist Party of Brazil and has been a senator for something like 15 years.

And who is Jair Bolsonaro? He is not a new politician in the Brazilian scene, he has been a house representative for 26 years. He is a parasite that did nothing for the country, not one bill, just arranged government positions for his family. But let me use his own words to describe him:

1993: “I am in favor of a dictatorship, a regime of exception.”

1999: “The pau-de-arara [a torture technique] works. I’m in favor of torture, you know that. And the people are in favor as well.”

19999: “Through the vote, you will not change anything in this country, nothing, absolutely nothing! It will only change, unfortunately, when, one day, we start a civil war here and do the work that the military regime did not do. Killing some 30,000, starting with FHC [then-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso], not kicking them out, killing! If some innocent people are going to die, fine, in any war, innocents die.”

2003: “I’m a rapist now. I would never rape you, because you do not deserve it … slut!” to another representative at the house

2010: “I would be incapable of loving a homosexual child. I’m not going to act like a hypocrite here: I’d rather have my son die in an accident than show up with some mustachioed guy. For me, he would have died.… “If your son starts acting a little gay, hit him with some leather, and he’ll change his behavior.”

2016: “I would not employ [a woman] with the same salary [of a man]. But there are many women who are competent.”

2017: “I’ll give carte blanche for the police to kill.”

2018: “This group, if they want to stay here, will have to put itself under the law of all of us. Leave or go to jail. These red marginals will be banished from our homeland.”

2018: “You will not have any more NGOs to quench your leftist hunger. It will be a cleansing never before seen in the history of Brazil.”

During the presidential campaign, Bolsonaro participated only in two debates on the first round, before Haddad’s candidacy was defined.

Then he was stabbed in a rally and didn’t join any other debate because he was following his doctor’s recommendations. Although when the second round started, his doctors said he was ok to participate in debates with Haddad and he refused. He later on even acknowledged that not debating Haddad on national television was part of his strategy.

And who is behind Bolsonaro’s campaign strategy? Steve Bannon. And what was the base of Bolsonaro campaign? Facebook and Whatsapp. They created a machine of spreading information (whatever that is, hate messages, fake news). Part of this machine was paid by rich businessmen in Brazil, they spent $12 million with mass marketing campaigns on Whatsapp. This is something that is illegal in Brazil for two reasons: 1. The private sector can’t finance political campaigns. To do what these businessmen did by not directly giving the money to Bolsonaro but directly paying the marketing companies for their services is called “caixa 2’”and is a crime. Another crime here is to use lists, contact lists, to send campaign propaganda that is not your party list. Like the same way we build our contact list when you sign up at the door, during elections, parties are supposed to only send these type of messages to the contacts on their list, not buy lists from marketing companies.

During the elections there was a wave of violence promoted by Bolsonaro supporters. Remember the rightwing base that took the streets during the impeachment process? This is a very violent base and very dangerous. A capoeirista, Mestre Moa, was killed in Bahia because he expressed his support for Haddad. A young woman was attacked and had a swastika marked on her body with a knife by Bolsonaro supporters because she had a sticker of the #EleNao campaign, a campaign lead by women against Bolsonaro.

This was actually the most violent national elections in history. In two months of electoral process, 136 violent attacks were registered, with 42 people injured and eight people killed.

The people who engaged in the “turn the vote” or vira voto campaign right after the first round were a bit afraid of approaching people and how to approach people. We here in NYC went to do outreach in Newark and we were very low key because of that.

But over time, the outreach strategies were iterated constantly through people sharing what was working, what was not, new materials to try, new arguments and so on. The strategies became more and more out there, people start to set up tables with cake and coffee inviting others to come and talk with them if they had questions about who to vote for. Even famous people joined, like novela actors were out there talking with people. The last week and a half before the second round, this grassroots work became amazing, it felt like for the first time since the coup, the mobilized people that were fighting against the coup managed to reach out to the not yet mobilized people and were capable of building a dialogue with them, engage them. The ViraVoto grassroots mobilization will for sure become part of Brazil’s history.

Then Bolsonaro wins the election. It’s important to note that from the votes cast, the actual count was: 39percent for Bolsonaro, 32 percent for Haddad, 29 percent for Abstained. So there was 61 percent who rejected Bolsonaro. The thing is that half of these people also had a very strong rejection of the Workers Party, so strong that they preferred not to vote for it, even though they didn’t really support Bolsonaro.

My personal feeling is that we do have a great potential to organize and mobilize this 61 percent. The ViraVoto showed there is a way to connect and join forces. For instance,”defend democracy” was a connection point. We need to find more connection points to rebuild the base.

Even the Workers Party used the strategy of removing itself from the message. In the second round they had slogans for their campaign that started “I am not a petista but because of x I will vote for Haddad” [Petista refers to Workers Party members or supporters-ed].

The left in Brazil needs to be able to join forces and build a strong base.

Also, now more than ever, we, the resistance, need to professionalize our organizing capacity and build as many skills as we can to meet the demand. Because we are already seeing attacks against the landless movement, which had one of their camps set on fire. We are seeing attacks against Indigenous communities all across the country; one of them had a medical center set on fire. Already there are attempts at censorship against universities and teachers. We saw people with guns out in the streets, military parades celebrating Bolsonaro’s victory. There is an idea for a law to criminalize the landless movement and the homeless movement as terrorist. Bolsonaro is announcing his government and everything will be taken over by the worst of the worst in Brazil’s politics. Remember Judge Moro who put Lula in jail, removing the biggest opponent of Bolsonaro in the race? He just accepted an offer to be Bolsonaro’s Minister of Justice. Bolsonaro plans on merging the Agriculture and Environment ministries, which will lead to more destruction of the Amazon and other forests and is already destroying our education system.

And because of all of this I will end my talk how I started. We must be organized, we must take care of each other, we must fight, we must resist.

Ghodsee. Undeterred by a flood of snarky Twitter commentary (""Before or after their husbands were sent to the Gulag?""), Ghodsee has now expanded her article into a short book with an almost identical title—it is now in the present tense, presumably for a more forward-looking approach.

She gets points for persistence, but the thesis doesn't really fare better in book form.

Make no mistake: The ""socialism"" in Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism is not the ""capitalism + welfare state"" Western European model. It's the hardcore Warsaw Pact variety that was dispatched to the proverbial ash heap of history in 1991. Indeed, the book's introduction opens with a photo of Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to fly into space in July 1963; the caption earnestly states that she later ""became a prominent politician and led the Soviet delegation to the 1975 United Nations Conference on Women."" Being a ""prominent politician"" in the USSR is a bit like being a prominent biologist in the Young Earth creationist community.

Ghodsee, a professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania, approvingly notes the rising popularity of socialism; she clearly intends her book as a contribution to ongoing debates over socialist systems. But there is no reason to think that American millennials who favor ""socialism"" are thinking of Soviet-style state socialism, as opposed to, say, Scandinavian social democracy. Surely one can advocate for the latter (wisely or not) without trying to rehabilitate the former. And yet Ghodsee, who accuses ""conservative cold warriors"" of trying to discredit alternatives to capitalism by ""screaming about Stalin's famines and purges,"" tries to do just that: ""Although it's important not to romanticize the state socialist past, the ugly realities should not make us completely oblivious to the ideals of the early socialists, to the various attempts to reform the system from within (such as the Prague Spring, glasnost, or perestroika)….Acknowledging the bad does not negate the good.""

""The good"" allegedly includes female empowerment in general and good sex for women in particular. Ghodsee's thesis is that capitalism inevitably commodifies sex, cheapens female labor (because women, thanks to childbearing and other factors, have less bargaining power in the market), and relegates women's caring tasks to unpaid drudgery while forcing them to depend on male earnings. By contrast, the socialist message included the promise of both economic and sexual liberation for women.

The operative word here is promise. Ghodsee ruefully admits that things turned out a bit differently in reality. ""Many women suffered under a double burden of mandatory formal employment and domestic work,"" she acknowledges, while ""discussions of sexual harassment, domestic violence, and rape"" were suppressed. Meanwhile, abortion was less a choice than a necessity, serving ""as a primary form of birth control"" (except where it was banned, as in Stalin's Soviet Union after 1936 and under the Ceausescu regime in Romania after 1966). Nonetheless, Ghodsee insists that women's integration into the workforce in the Soviet bloc was a trailblazing model of female employment, that institutional day care was a success, and that women's love lives benefited from not having to trade sex for material support.

The only actual evidence Ghodsee offers for the joys of socialist sex is some polls suggesting that East German women were having more and better sex than their Wessi sisters. (As the British social historian Josie McLennan demonstrates in her 2011 study, Love in a Time of Communism, the actual findings are complicated, contradictory, and often dubious. One such survey suggested that East German men were better endowed, which mostly seems to demonstrate that Communism breeds more prolific liars.) There's also some anecdotal stuff, such as a 40something Soviet-born woman who hears Ghodsee discuss her op-ed on a radio show and emails to say that she ""nailed it""—with no mention of other Soviet-born women whose reaction was ""You've got to be kidding.""

As someone who lived in the Soviet Union until emigrating as a teen in 1980, I can say that Ghodsee must have a truly enormous pair of rose-colored glasses.

Ghodsee does acknowledge that the Soviet revolutionaries' initial embrace of sexual freedom and liberation from traditional family roles—notably championed by Alexandra Kollontai, the most prominent female Bolshevik—soon gave way to a far more conservative outlook. Childbearing became a national imperative; non-procreative sex, a bourgeois frivolity. The post-Stalin thaw ushered in a less repressive environment. But as the sexual revolution swept the West, Soviet culture remained remarkably puritanical well into the 1980s. One infamous moment that came to symbolize this prudery was when a woman in the Leningrad studio audience of a 1986 U.S.–Soviet satellite TV talk show seemed to declare, ""In the Soviet Union, there is no sex."" (She actually said ""no sex on television,"" but the last two words were drowned out by laughter.)

Besides cultural attitudes, there were socialist practicalities—particularly a lack of privacy, to which Ghodsee only briefly alludes. Single young adults shared cramped apartments with parents, siblings, and often other relatives; so did most young marrieds. Many couples lacked even a private bedroom, which understandably put a damper on things; there were horror tales of conjugal moments ruined by a parent or in-law shouting ""Cut it out, I'm trying to sleep!"" from behind a curtain. Add the lack of contraceptives and the barbarity of Soviet abortion (anesthesia required a bribe), and it's a wonder any sex happened at all.

Things were not quite as bleak in some Soviet satellite countries—East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia—that had higher living standards and more cultural freedom. (They even allowed some bawdy films, a fact reflected in a Russian joke: Group sex Soviet-style is getting together with some Polish friends who tell you what they saw in a Swedish porno movie.) On the other hand, Ceausescu's Romania, where birth control was banned and fertile women's menstrual periods were monitored to combat illicit abortions, makes the USSR look like a sexual paradise.

Ghodsee's portrayal of women's public lives in Eastern Bloc countries is just as comically whitewashed. Thus, a handful of women who snagged high-level posts under regimes ruled by all-male elites are trotted out as evidence of ""state socialist countries' commitment to the ideal of women's rights,"" though Ghodsee concedes that ""actual practice did not live up to the rhetoric."" You don't say.

A particularly odd section recounts Ghodsee's own experience in a Model U.N. high school club, where she decided to become the Eastern bloc specialist because she ""knew"" the boys would nix a female United States or United Kingdom representative as too implausible. ""The lesson I learned at fifteen was that while it was implausible that my own country would allow a woman to make crucial foreign policy decision on the world stage, this was perfectly possible for the Soviet Union,"" Ghodsee writes. This was in 1986, when Jeane Kirkpatrick had just finished a four-year stint as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations—and no Warsaw Pact country had ever had a female U.N. envoy.

While Ghodsee is determined to see the best in the socialist East's Potemkin feminism, the capitalist West is judged by its anecdotal worst. A friend of Ghodsee's who becomes a full-time mother is reduced to begging her husband for a credit card for a night out and grimly resolves to accommodate his demands for more sex to earn her spending money. A male friend avoids too-intimidating ambitious women and marries a foreign gold-digger who ditches him as soon as she gets her green card. (In Ghodsee's world, apparently, no one in the socialist bloc ever traded sex for material goods such as a better living situation.) Another friend, a tech executive, swears he'll never hire another woman after a star employee has a baby and quits. There is no acknowledgment in this book that, for all our remaining problems of gender inequality, Western capitalism has done a pretty impressive job of adapting to women's changing roles, or that a flexible market offers unique opportunities to craft career paths compatible with child-rearing.

Work-family balance will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. The generous family leave policies that Ghodsee admires may make things easier for some, but they often end up pushing women onto a career-limiting mommy track, which suggests that tradeoffs are inevitable. We can certainly strive to ensure that both women and men have more opportunities to choose a life that suits them and their children best, though Ghodsee's obsession with numerical parity (such as equal numbers of male and female stay-at-home parents) seems counterproductive.

The main lesson of this volume seems to be that many left-wing critics of capitalism can't bring themselves to fully repudiate the legacy of 20th-century Marxism-Leninism. Ghodsee concludes by claiming there ""was a baby in all that bathwater."" Not in this book, there isn't.","One of the most mercilessly mocked New York Times op-eds of recent memory was ""Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism,"" a 2017 piece by Kristen R. Ghodsee.

209,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/they-see-no-shame-honour-killing-video-shows-plight-of-syrian-women,"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,'They see no shame': 'honour' killing video shows plight of Syrian women,"Kalashnikov in hand, the man looks into the camera. He stands over a terrified girl, who is pleading for her life.

“Make sure we can see both your faces,” a voice orders.

Behind the shaky camera, another one goads the gunman: “Go ahead, Bashar – cleanse your honour.”

Without another word, a flurry of bullets is fired into Rasha Bseis’s body. It takes nine agonising seconds for her to die.

Rasha had been murdered on camera by her brother, Bashar Bseis, condemned by rumours that she had committed adultery, for which the punishment – in her brother’s eyes – was death.

Even in a war as long and bloody as Syria’s, the execution, shared thousands of times on social media, shocked the Syrian community. The events unfolded after a scorned suitor had posted images of Rasha online. She was dragged from her home in a camp just 2km from Turkey’s border and shot by a soldier it trained and equipped – a fighter enlisted in the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army.

“What [Bseis] did was not an ethic of the Free Syrian Army and is contrary to the principles of our revolution,” Mustafa Sejari, a spokesman for the FSA, told the Guardian, adding that an investigation was under way and that a military court in Jarabulus had issued a warrant for Bseis.

Weeks later, however, an arrest has yet to be made, and there are fears that, as an FSA fighter, Bseis will never be held to account.

“These are people who see no shame in killing the girl, but actually believe it’s what washes away the shame she has brought on the whole family,” says exiled Syrian writer Loubna Mrie. “An innocent girl is dead because some guy posted her pictures on Facebook.”

While not unique to the Middle East, “honour” killings are a problem deeply rooted in Syrian society, “and not exclusive to one area or sect or faction”, says Mrie.

Even before the war began in 2011, women’s rights groups in Syria estimated that 300 women were killed each year by male relatives, and numbers have escalated during the crisis. Until 2009, killers were allowed to walk free if they justified the act as motivated by honour. The government repealed the law, replacing it with a mere two-year maximum sentence.

“I remember I was nine years old the first time I saw a video of a guy smashing his sister’s skull with a stone while the whole village watched and cheered,” says Mrie.

Such killings are meant to seal the matter, never to be spoken of again – perpetuating a culture of silence that functions to protect the killer.

Women on all sides of Syria’s war are targeted. When violence broke out in 2011, a campaign of mass rape by Assad’s soldiers was perniciously effective in both oppressing communities and provoking defections to the loosely formed Free Syrian Army.

Today, institutional protections for women in rebel-held territories are still severely lacking.

“It’s anarchy – the only rule is by traditions and customs, and the factions,” says Ola Marwa, head of protection at Women Now for Development, which operates in northern Syria.

A culture of shame means Syrian women rarely feel safe to report sexual violence. Even if they do, there are few avenues of support because “there’s no real authority or law to stand on,” Marwa says. “It’s difficult to raise awareness about empowering women to combat sexual violence because even discussing it is seen as incitement for people to go against their culture.”

Rasha’s killing in Jarabulus adds to a host of concerns plaguing Turkey’s allies in northern Syria, and raises questions over the future rule of law in the areas its military has intervened.

Turkey has made significant investments into rebel-held Syria – training its police force, building roads, hospitals and even branches of the Turkish postal service. By managing FSA groups, officials say they seek to bolster rebels more in line with its values, while sidelining extremist elements.

“We condemn this incident very clearly and explicitly,” says Leyla Şahin Usta, human rights chair of Turkey’s ruling AK Party.

“We are making efforts to correct mistakes made – the FSA has their own police force and their own courts. As the observer country, we advise them on the norms of human rights – but at the end of the day, the FSA is in charge.”

In June, a UN report raised concerns about sexual harassment and other human rights violations endangering the rule of law in Turkey’s newly conquered territories.

“Turkey has, at least publicly, tried to professionalise their rebel allies inside Syria – but they have not invested heavily in doing that,” says Haid Haid, research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. “That’s why you still have rebel groups committing atrocities, attacking civilians, preventing courts from arresting people, which allows some to violate the rights of others with immunity.”

A senior commander in the Turkey-backed rebel coalition adamantly denied reports of fighters committing sexual assault against local women, and vowed those who did would face a military court. “These crimes are unforgivable, and anyone who commits them will face their fair destiny,” Colonel Haitham Afisi told the Guardian.

Bashar Bseis nonetheless managed to flee to his hometown, Kastoon in Hama, outside FSA control. By the laws of the Islamic sharia courts that operate there, if he finds four witnesses to testify that Rasha committed adultery, he will be exonerated in her killing.

“Turkey definitely has a responsibility to hold its allies accountable when it comes to courts,” says Haid. “They don’t have the force yet to enforce their decisions, especially on rebel members.”

Still, “honour” killings may not be an issue the FSA is able or willing to solve, Mrie says. She questions the FSA’s motivations for starting the investigation and issuing the arrest warrant.

“I don’t know if they are doing this because they believe this guy should be held accountable, or just because it went viral on social media.”","Even in a war as long and bloody as Syria’s, the execution, shared thousands of times on social media, shocked the Syrian community.
“These are people who see no shame in killing the girl, but actually believe it’s what washes away the shame she has brought on the whole family,” says exiled Syrian writer Loubna Mrie.
Until 2009, killers were allowed to walk free if they justified the act as motivated by honour.
A culture of shame means Syrian women rarely feel safe to report sexual violence.
“We condemn this incident very clearly and explicitly,” says Leyla Şahin Usta, human rights chair of Turkey’s ruling AK Party."

A global economy where no one is left behind

Jacinda Ardern uses her time at APEC to champion inclusive trade on the world stage, which means lifting those at the bottom. Laura Walters reports.

The women sit in clear rows behind the newly-built benches, dotted with neat piles of garlic, onions, potato leaves and bananas. They wear brightly-coloured shirts and broad smiles.

Almost all of the 1500 to 2000 vendors, and their clients, who work at Port Moresby’s Gordons Market are women. And about 80 percent of Papua New Guinea’s eight million people earn their living at markets across the country.

For three generations, Papua New Guinean women have been selling and buying their wares at the Pacific’s biggest fresh produce market, contending with unsanitary conditions for them and their children, and selling from mud puddles next to piles of rubbish. The market was also notorious for theft.

While the skyline continues to climb in the nation's capital, with new infrastructure projects and the growing wealth of a few, the majority of people struggle daily. A third of the country live in poverty.

Papua New Guinea is the smallest developing economy in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group of 21 countries. But its situation is not unlike those of other Pacific countries, and across the world there is a growing divide between those who have and those who do not.

Globalisation has failed many

This year, Jacinda Ardern’s message to the world has been consistent: globalisation hasn’t worked for everyone, but it can.

In her speech to the UN General Assembly in September, Ardern said every country and its citizens had been impacted by globalisation.

“While that impact has been positive for many, for others it has not. The transitions our economies have made have often been jarring, and the consequences harsh.

“And so amongst unprecedented global economic growth, we have still seen a growing sense of isolation, dislocation, and a sense of insecurity and the erosion of hope,"" she said.

Ardern repeated this during her time in Singapore and then Papua New Guinea, last week, where she tried to shine a light on those who had not benefited from globalisation.

The theme for this year’s APEC, held in Port Moresby, was “Harnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future"".

During an interview with the BBC, while in Singapore, Ardern spoke about the fallout from globalisation, along with the risks of protectionism.

“Now it’s a global market and with that comes a little bit of fear - fear around job security, fear about whether your children will have the same opportunities that you had,” she said.

“Our response as political leaders can be twofold: we can either capitilise on that fear by blaming others and saying that the answer is to become more and more insular; to become protectionist; to build up those walls around us so that we can retreat back to yesteryear.

“The alternative is to give a message of hope.”

Ardern said New Zealand did not have the option of retreating, due to its geography and size. Instead, it would work with other countries, using regional groups like East Asia Summit (EAS) and APEC, to find solutions to current issues, so nobody was left behind.

Women's empowerment

In the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) summit family photo, Ardern stands out. She’s one of only two female leaders, along with Aung San Suu Kyi.

This was a similar theme throughout the week. At APEC, she was one of three female leaders, along with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. She was the only popularly-elected leader present.

Ardern used the trip to raise the issue of women’s representation, as well as issues that plagued women and children across the Asia-Pacific region.

Papua New Guinea has no female MPs, and since gaining independence in 1975, the country has had seven female MPs. Globally, about 5 percent of leaders are female.

At the market, the vendors burst into applause when Ardern brought up the issue of women in politics, saying she hoped the redeveloped market would lead to more successful businesses for women and their families, who would then consider a career in politics.

“If you want a community or a country to thrive, then you look after the women, because the women look after the children...

“Behind women are families, behind them will be the success of their community.”

Ardern said the market redevelopment, which New Zealand half-funded to the tune of $7 million, was a very deliberate project.

The partnership with Papua New Guinea’s National Capital District Commission, which also put in $7m, and UN Women, meant about 2000 vendors had a covered, two-storey building, with rubbish disposal, toilets, and running water.

Women in the Asia-Pacific don't have the same level of economic empowerment or independence as men, but still make up half the population. Meanwhile, many Pacific countries like Papua New Guinea struggle with high rates of domestic violence.

It was important to focus on vulnerable communities, in order to lift outcomes for the whole country, Ardern said.

The real Port Moresby

Later that day, Foreign Minister Winston Peters made his own announcement of up to $10m to help with the country’s general vaccination drive. As much as $3m of that money could be used to help boost polio vaccinations in the wake of an outbreak which has killed at least one person.

Health Secretary Pascoe Kase said exact vaccination rates were not known but in some provinces only about half of people would be covered by general vaccinations.

During the announcement at St John ambulance centre, which New Zealand put $1.3m into helping build and kit out, St John Council chair Jean Kekedo was not afraid to speak her mind.

The former senior diplomat and civil servant told Peters he had not seen the real Port Moresby during his APEC visit.

The skyscrapers and empty streets did not truly represent the country where most people struggle every day, she said.

Digital divide

An increasing theme of globalisation is the digital divide.

As the world moves online, with digital connectivity driving social and economic growth, those who do not have access to electricity, internet, and technology are being left behind.

In keeping with the theme of lifting those at the bottom, New Zealand has joined the United States, Japan, Australia and Papua New Guinea, to invest in a major electrification project in Papua New Guinea.

The US$1.7b ($2.5b) project was aimed at helping the country reach its goal of 70 percent electrification by 2030. Currently about 13 percent of the country has access to power.

New Zealand was chipping in about $20m of new money – mostly in the form of expertise – in addition to $35m worth of existing power projects in Papua New Guinea.

Again, Ardern raised the importance of electricity for women, during the announcement made alongside US Vice President Mike Pence, Papua New Guinea’s Peter O’Neill, Japan’s Shinzo Abe and Australia’s Scott Morrison.

Electricity meant less time spent on menial jobs, and more time for women to focus on education and business. Simple things like having a light at night to enable families to read, or students to study will make a marked difference.

Trade Minister David Parker said in the age of the internet it was important that economies had a strategy to harness digital potential without leaving some behind.

New Zealand, along with Chile an Canada, had specific policies focusing on inclusivity.

“For some countries, despite the rules around trading, there is a degredation because some don’t believe trade is working for them... There’s a real need to keep up to date the global rules around e-commerce and the like, and build support for trade by making sure everyone benefits from it, and not just a few,” Parker said.

Beyond trade

New Zealand International Business Forum boss Stephen Jacobi said APEC’s voluntary and non-binding nature was its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.

Countries could use APEC as a place to try new things, develop new concepts, and exchange ideas.

While it took a while for APEC to deliver tangible results, it was a good way to focus on bigger picture issues – like inclusive trade and globalisation – at a high level.

“APEC sometimes gets a bad press for never delivering but it’s an important forum to have.”

New Zealand punched above its weight when it came to regional summits, he said, adding that Ardern was well-placed to talk about women’s empowerment and inclusiveness.

The regional grouping wasn’t just about trade – that was a narrow way to look at it.

“The conversations are wider than trade and investment; it needs to look at things that impact on the lives of citizens.”

APEC was a regional incubator for figuring out how to address the big issues facing the global economy.

“Everybody realises it’s got to better than it is now,” he said.","TradeA global economy where no one is left behindJacinda Ardern uses her time at APEC to champion inclusive trade on the world stage, which means lifting those at the bottom.

By Nick Paton Walsh and Masoud Popalzai

Herat, Afghanistan (CNN)An unprecedented drought in Afghanistan has led to families selling their children just to be able to feed their households.

CNN has spoken to multiple families around the western city of Herat who have been forced from their homes because of a record dry spell that, according to the United Nations, has forced more people from their homes in 2018 than the record violence afflicting the country.

The UN estimates that over 275,000 people have been displaced by the drought, 84,000 of them in the city itself, and 182,000 in the region of Badghis.

Four years of failed rains have savaged the agriculture of the region, and even caused the opium crop to fall by a third this year, despite record output in 2017. The extreme weather conditions are causing concerns that global climate change is having a severe impact on the world's most fragile country, where decades of war have ground the economy and society to dust.

Outside Herat, in a refugee camp, a CNN cameraman met Mamareen, who has lost her husband to the war, her home to the climate and now her daughter to the urgent need to feed her other children. Akila, 6, is now, under the warped economy of this tent city, the possession of another family. Mamareen sold Akila for $3,000 to Najmuddin, who has promised her to his 10-year-old son, Sher Agha.

""I fled my village with my three children because of severe drought,"" she says. ""I came here thinking that I will receive some assistance, but I got nothing. To avoid starvation among my children, I gave my daughter to a man for about $3,000, but have only got $70 so far. I had no money, no food and no breadwinner -- my husband was also killed.""

Asked if Akila knew her fate, she said: ""She doesn't know that I have sold her. How would she know? She is a child. But I had no other choice. Whether in tears or laughter, she will have to go. Who would sell a piece of her heart unless they really have to?""

A charitable act?

Her fate lay meters away, in another, richer tent in the camp, with Najmuddin, her purchaser. Part of this transaction is cultural -- part of the mores of a society where girls have long been traded for dowries rather than being asked for consent. But to Najmuddin, this was an act of charity.

""Her family didn't have anything to eat. They were hungry,"" he said. ""I know I am also poor, but I am sure I can pay it off slowly... in two to three years.""

The Afghan cameraman asked, aren't they children? ""It doesn't matter. These things happen here. Even an old man marries a young girl. It happens.""

Najmuddin is victim of the same drought that has destroyed worlds across western Afghanistan, which was once the breadbasket of the war-torn, landlocked nation. He said: ""The wheat crop failed, we couldn't grow melons -- all the other crops failed because of drought. We lost our livestock. The sheep, cows and goats all died of hunger as there wasn't fodder for them.""

This was not an isolated case. A man who refused to give his name discussing the sale of his 4-year-old daughter said: ""I had no other choice, I had no money and no source of income. The man came here and gave me two options: either to pay back his money or to give him my daughter. I went with the latter.""

These devastating decisions come at a time when Afghanistan is reeling from a series of superlatives. Record Taliban control or influence of territory -- at 45% according to the US inspector into the war -- and record civilian casualties. And a very high, yet undisclosed number of Afghan security force deaths, the actual figure being classified by the US and Afghan governments.","Mamareen sold Akila for $3,000 to Najmuddin, who has promised her to his 10-year-old son, Sher Agha.

214,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/opposition-files-motion-of-no-confidence-in-st-lucia-gov-t_150188?profile=1,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Jamaica Observer,Opposition files motion of no confidence in St Lucia Gov't,"CASTRIES, St Lucia (CMC) — The main Opposition St Lucia Labour Party (SLP) yesterday filed a motion of no confidence against the Government of Prime Minister Allen Chastanet, calling also for his immediate resignation as the head of the two-and-a-half-year-old Administration.

“In my capacity as leader of the Parliamentary Opposition and leader of the St Lucia Labour Party, I delivered this morning to the clerk of Parliament, for onward submission to the speaker of the House, a copy of a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and minister of finance,” SLP leader, Phillip J Pierre told a news conference ahead of the start of yesterday's sitting of Parliament.

Chastanet led the United Workers Party (UWP) to an 11-6 majority in the Parliament following the June 6 General Election. The SLP won the other six seats.

Pierre said that the motion and the anticipated debate will articulate the deep concerns, anxieties, and the feeling of hopelessness among large sections of the St Lucian society about the uncaring and irresponsible manner in which the business of the country is currently managed.

He said that since the appointment and installation of Chastanet as prime minister and minister of finance, economic growth, job creation and external affairs, St Lucia has been governed in a manner that has undermined the constitution, its conventions, and practices.

“We have witnessed a growing abuse of public office, unreasonable and irrational decision-making, unsustainable fiscal deficits, squandering of the State's financial resources, and a debilitating decline in the public trust and confidence in the prime minister's ability to govern the country.”

Pierre said that Prime Minister Chastanet, while acknowledging the need for of a deputy speaker by proposing and supporting the nomination of Sarah Flood-Beaubrun as deputy speaker, caused her to resign at a subsequent meeting of Parliament without explanation, leaving the position vacant.

“This amounts to no more than an abuse and contempt for the intentions of our constitution and the people's Parliament.”

The Opposition leader said that Prime Minister Chastanet has refused to lay in Parliament, for debate, a statement on the use of the funds in the St Lucia National Economic Fund established under the Citizen by Investment Programme, despite pleas from the public and the Opposition.

“The prime minister, by his failure to do so, has acted in breach of the Act, thereby contributing to growing suspicions about the lack of transparency and trust in the Citizenship by Investment Programme.

“The prime minister has recklessly and irresponsibly allowed the economy to descend into unsustainable deficits, and has embarked on the dangerous path of having to fund those deficits by incurring more debt,” Pierre said.

He said the “misguided actions and inactions” of Prime Minister Chastanet, as it relates to the health of the nation, “have plunged the provision of health care services into a deep crisis, created rising uncertainty, undermining morale among health care practitioners, and has now encouraged an exodus of trained nurses from the health care system”.

Pierre further claimed that Prime Minister Chastanet has demonstrated little appreciation for the value of education as a major instrument for the alleviation of poverty and the general well-being of St Lucians.

“He has adopted policies inimical to the interest and benefit of teachers and students, and in so doing he is jeopardising the future of our children and our country's prospects,” Pierre said, noting that while the SLP will not predict the outcome of the motion, there are legislators who are already deciding to vote against the motion before the debate takes place and are setting themselves up as “collaborators with Prime Minister Chastanet's callous and uncaring policies”.

“The Opposition is calling on all House members, in particular, members on the Government side, to place country above self and support the vote of no confidence in the leadership of Allen Chastanet, and that he resigns immediately as prime minister of St Lucia,” Pierre told reporters.","CASTRIES, St Lucia (CMC) — The main Opposition St Lucia Labour Party (SLP) yesterday filed a motion of no confidence against the Government of Prime Minister Allen Chastanet, calling also for his immediate resignation as the head of the two-and-a-half-year-old Administration.

The statement, however, makes no mention of any 'immediate support' for Pakistan.

Prior to their departure for the visit, the Pakistani delegation had talked of seeking balance of payments support from China through this visit, and Prime Minister Khan reiterated to journalists in Beijing on Thursday that he sought support to build foreign exchange reserves and assistance to avoid a possible International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.

Instead the statement only says that both sides will ""maintain frequent exchange of visits and meetings at the leadership level"" and further bilateral meeting will be held on the sidelines of major multilateral conferences and events.

""During his visit, H.E. Imran Khan called on H.E. Xi Jinping, President of China, held talks with H.E. Li Keqiang, Premier, and met with H.E. Li Zhanshu, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and H.E. Wang Qishan, Vice President of China respectively"" the statement says, suggesting Premier Keqiang was the key point person in the talks with the Pakistani prime minister.

The PM also gave a speech at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and visited the First China International Import Expo held in Shanghai.

The statement hailed the ties between Pakistan and China, saying they had ""withstood the test of time, notwithstanding the changes in domestic, regional and international environments.""

In deepening the ties further, the statement says the two countries will build on the China-Pakistan All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership and the China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future, ""in line with the principles set forth by the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good-neighbourly Relations"" that the two countries signed 2005.

""Both sides will continue to view China-Pakistan relations from a strategic and long-term perspective"" the statement says at the outset as it starts to lay out the terms of the future cooperation both countries agreed to undertake.

The Chinese side also ""appreciated Pakistan's important role in promoting regional peace, stability and security and efforts for the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with its neighbours"" the statement says, adding that China ""supports Pakistan’s efforts for improvement of Pakistan-India relations and for settlement of outstanding disputes between the two countries.""

On the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), both sides ""expressed satisfaction that rapid progress has been made in all areas especially in the energy sector"" and underlined ""their complete consensus on the future trajectory of the CPEC"".

The language appears to be aimed at rolling back some of the PTI's commitments to 'review' CPEC projects, as well as some of the criticism it has levelled at the energy projects in the past.

The Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC), which is the steering arm of CPEC, will ""explore new areas of cooperation"" and its 8th session will be held in Beijing ""before the end of the year"". The last session was held in Islamabad in November 2017, during which the Long Term Plan was finalised.

Both sides agreed to accelerate work on Gwadar and its auxiliary projects, as well dismissing ""the growing negative propaganda against CPEC"" while underscoring their ""determination to safeguard the CPEC projects from all threats.""

""The Chinese side expressed its appreciation for the measures taken for the security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan.""

The shape and direction of CPEC is now set to change, with a growing emphasis on ""industrial capacity including through joint ventures in priority areas and relocation of labour-intensive industry and SMEs collaboration.""

The growing trade imbalance between Pakistan and China will be addressed through the second China Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, which the two sides ""agreed to conclude as early as possible"" while continuing with discussions on an agreement on trade in services as well.

In addition, both sides also agreed to boost cooperation in a wide range of areas, including tourism, maritime issues, navigation security, marine economy, resources, research and environmental protection. In addition to marine economy, emerging technologies like nanotech, biotech and ICT will also see strengthened collaboration to increase their contribution in health, agriculture, water, energy and food security.

Space cooperation will also be promoted, building on the launch of Pakistan's Remote Sensing Satellite earlier this year.

Cooperation will now be enhanced in areas like climate change, desertification control, desalination, water management, afforestation and ecological restoration, wetland protection and restoration, wildlife protection, forestry industry development, disaster management and risk reduction among others.

All these are areas of cooperation that were already agreed upon in earlier discussions with the Chinese side that ended with the finalisation of the LTP in November last year.

The Joint Statement shows that the evolution of CPEC has now come to a point where these cooperative steps are ready to be activated.

In addition, the statement points at social sector cooperation without giving many specifics, only to say areas like ""agriculture, education, health, poverty alleviation, safe drinking water and vocational training"" will be increasing parts of the policy dialogue going forward.

Disease surveillance and control, as well as vaccine production and ""traditional medicine"" will also be part of the dialogue.

Both sides agreed to enhance people-to-people contacts, pointing at the 25,000 Pakistani students already enrolled in Chinese universities. ""China will offer additional scholarships for Pakistani students"" the statements says.

Cooperation in this area will go beyond to think tanks, vocational training, fellowships as well as ""culture, arts, broadcasting, films, publication and sports"".

Both sides will discuss further collaboration in museums, and ""the possibility to organise an Ancient Pakistan and Gandhara Artifacts Exhibition in Beijing.""

Defence and Security Cooperation

One of the most important areas of cooperation will be in future defence and security arrangements, where ""[b]oth sides agreed to further enhance cooperation against 'Three Evils' of extremism, terrorism and separatism.""

""The Chinese side conveyed its support to Pakistan's commitment and efforts to counter terrorism, assured Pakistan of its support in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, and commended the tremendous sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation in fight against terrorism and for Pakistan’s immense contribution to regional and international peace and security through its achievements and successes,"" the statement says.

Perhaps reflecting on the past meetings of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where China withdrew its support for Pakistan abruptly at a time when the grey listing of Pakistan's financial system was under consideration, the statement suggests that the next meeting of FATF scheduled in November might be different.

""The Chinese side recognised Pakistan’s efforts in actively strengthening financial regulations to combat terrorism financing, and called on all relevant parties to view Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts in an objective and fair manner.""

At a later point, the statement goes a step further, adding that ""both sides underscored the need for all States to avoid politicisation of the UN Sanctions regime and the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).""

For its part, Pakistan ""reaffirmed its support to the Chinese side in safeguarding its sovereignty and security, and combating separatism, terrorism and extremism including East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM).""

On Afghanistan, both sides underlined their continued support for an ""Afghan-owned and Afghan-led"" peace and reconciliation process.

""China appreciates that Pakistan and Afghanistan are coordinating closely through the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS) to enhance cooperation between the two countries in all areas.""

Both sides also agreed on the importance of the tripartite foreign minister's level talks between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan, calling on Afghanistan to host the second round of the dialogue ""within this year"".

Foreign policy cooperation

""The two sides underlined the importance of peaceful settlement of all disputes in the Middle East on the basis of mutual respect and in accordance to the precepts of international law.""

The statement also had words of support for Iran in its growing confrontation with the United States, which recently announced that it will disengage from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that was agreed upon after 20 months of negotiations between the United States, European Union and other partners and Iran.

""The two sides agreed that JCPOA is an important outcome of multilateralism and a good model of negotiated settlement of complex issues through dialogue and diplomacy"" the joint statement says.

""They called on parties to uphold their respective commitments and to resolve all issues through dialogue. They opposed unilateral measures and long-arm jurisdiction that is inconsistent with the principles of international law.""

On nuclear proliferation, China supported Pakistan's ""engagement with the Nuclear Suppliers Group and welcomes its adherence to NSG guidelines.""

Both sides also agreed that they will ""strengthen coordination and cooperation on international and regional issues of common interest"" in all international and regional forums. The Pakistani PM invited the Chinese leadership to visit Pakistan ""at a mutually convenient time"".","The statement, however, makes no mention of any 'immediate support' for Pakistan.

Govt changes base year to 2011-12, says growth in 2010-11 was 8.5%

Recalibrating data of past years using 2011-12 as the base year instead of 2004-05, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) estimated that India's GDP grew by 8.5% in the financial year 2010-11 (April 2010 to March 2011) and not at 10.3% as previously estimated.

Similarly, 9.3% growth rate each in 2005-06 and 2006-07 was lowered to 7.9% and 8.1% respectively, while 7.7% rate was now estimated for 2007-08 instead of 9.8%.

The GDP growth rate for 2008-09 -- the year that witnessed the global financial crisis -- was lowered to 3.1% from 3.9% in the previous estimate. For the following fiscal, the same was revised to 7.9% from 8.5% and for 2011-12, the growth was lowered to 5.2% from 6.6%.

In January 2015, the government moved to a new base year of 2011-12 from the earlier 2004-05 for national accounts. The base year of national accounts had been revised earlier in January 2010.

The revised growth numbers have been released ahead of the 2019 general elections.

At a joint press conference along with Chief Statistician Pravin Srivastava, Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said variation in two sets of numbers was due to the recalibration of data in certain sectors of the economy, including mining, quarrying and telecom.

""A complex exercise has been carried out by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation to update the National Accounts Series. The new series has made significant methodological improvements,"" Kumar said.

He added that the New Series, with its supporting back series, is ""internationally comparable and is in sync with UN Standard National Account.""

When asked if it is a coincidence that GDP numbers have been revised downwards only for the UPA period, Kumar replied in the negative.

""No it was not a coincidence. It was a matter of hard work done by the CSO officials who had taken the pain to do all the recalibration of economy that they have done,"" he said, adding, the methodology adopted has been vetted by leading statisticians.

'No intention to mislead'

Kumar further said the government has no intention to ""mislead or try and do something purposefully"" which does not reflect the reality.

Back-series data in contrast with NSC report

The so-called back-series data released Wednesday is in contrast to an August 2018 report by the Committee on Real Sector Statistics appointed by the National Statistical Commission (NSC), the autonomous body that helps in collection of data by India's statistical agencies.

In the report, which the government had subsequently stated was a draft seeking comments from stakeholders, the economy grew at a faster pace under the UPA government from 2004-05 to 2013-14, compared with the average growth during the first four years of the current government.

It had put the GDP growth at 10.08% in 2006-07 under the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the highest since the liberalisation of the economy in 1991. The highest ever growth rate since Independence was stated to be at 10.2% in 1988-89 when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister.

The committee's report has not been accepted and Kumar said the methodology adopted by them was flawed.

Giving reasons for divergence in the data sets, Srivastava said in the new series the share of primary sector in total Gross Value Added (GVA) is higher than that in the earlier 2004-05 series primarily due to changes in the data sources.

In the mining and quarrying sector, regular annual returns of public sector have been used instead of the Indian Bureau of Mines data in the 2004-05 base.

As per the CSO, the share of secondary sector in total GVA has increased in the back-series compared to the 2004-05 series. The increase is largely due to use of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) data and public sector data in organised electricity and manufacturing sectors, which was earlier sourced from annual reports of private electricity companies and annual survey of industries, respectively.

The share of the tertiary sector, which mainly includes services, in overall GVA has reduced in the back-series compared to the 2004-05 series.

Giving an example, Kumar said in the communication sector, in the old series, benchmark estimates were moved with telecom subscriber growth, where the growth was over 20%.

In the new series, minutes of usage has been adopted, which better reflects the behaviour of this sector, said the Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman.

The GDP figures for fiscals 2012-13 onwards on old series are not available for comparison, Kumar said, adding that the methodology used for computing the national accounts is in line with global standards.

Congress alleges 'manipulation' of data

The Congress Wednesday accused the Modi government of ""manipulating"" GDP data of previous years and said it reflects an desperate attempt to undermine India's growth story over the last 15 years.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala termed the step a ""classic"" case where ""the operation is successful but the patient is dead"".

""The entire GDP back series data released today reflects the desperate attempt of a defeatist Modi Government to undermine India's growth story over last 15 years. Modi Government and its puppet Niti Aayog want the people to believe that 2+2=8.

""Such is the gimmickry, jugglery, trickery and chicanery being sold as 'back series data',"" he said in a statement.

There was no immediate reaction from the BJP on the Congress's claims and allegations.

The Congress leader said the economic mismanagement under the Modi government has led to economic anarchy and jugglery of GDP figures. ""Manipulated back series data' will not change Modi government's exit date'. (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji's new definition of GDP is 'Gimmickry Data Product',"" he said.

Surjewala alleged a failed ""Modinomics plus a Pakoda economic vision"" has put India's economy in complete turmoil, and the prime minister and his finance minister have caused economic ""mayhem"" by the ""ill-conceived"" decisions of demonetisation, a ""flawed"" GST coupled with ""tax terrorism"".

""Faced with utter and complete rejection of the 'voodoo economics' of the Modi-Jaitley duo, they are resorting to malicious and fraudulent jugglery of GDP figures to hide the enormous body blow caused by them to India's economy,"" he said.

Surjewala alleged that since the advent of the NDA government in May 2014, there has been a determined effort to run down the record of the two UPA governments under Manmohan Singh during 2004-2009 and 2009-2014.

A lot of confusion was sown and the Modi government added to the confusion by changing the base year from 2004-05 to 2011-12, he said. The Congress leader said his party has repeatedly pointed out that when the base year was changed, the government should follow the healthy international practice and revise the numbers for the previous years.

""We had demanded that the back series data of GVA and GDP should be calculated and released so that meaningful comparisons can be made,"" he said, adding that the back series data as released by National Statistical Commission (NSC) in August 2018 is available in public domain and numbers prove that the truth cannot be suppressed.

'UPA delivered the highest decadal growth of 8.13%'

The opposition leader claimed that UPA-1 and UPA-2 delivered the highest decadal growth of 8.13% at factor cost since Independence and during this period 140 million people were lifted out of poverty.

When the UPA demitted office, economic growth had recovered to 6.39% at market prices in 2013-14. Besides, the fiscal deficit had been reduced to 4.48% and the current account deficit contained at 1.7%, he claimed.

""The revised New Series' computed today by the Ministry of Statistics and Niti Aayog has completely undermined the NSC (National Statistical Commission), the autonomous body for deciding data transparently and in accordance with global standards of calculating GDP as per Market Price Linked Methodology.

""Today, the Modi government deceived the country by surreptitiously changing the methodology in order to manipulate GDP data. This is called Excel Sheet Management' i.e deciding the result first and filling the marks later. The new methodology is GVA based, which does not take into account tax+ subsidies and consequently is extremely flawed to sub serve the myopic interests of the Modi government,"" he said.

Surjewala alleged that under this government, there has been complete stagnation in investment and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation in the last three years has remained constant at 28.5%. ""At that level of investment (GFCF), it is not possible to achieve higher growth rates,"" he said.

218,https://spectator.us/topic/proud-boys-extremist-group/,"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Spectator USA,"No, the Proud Boys aren’t an extremist group","According to a document obtained by the transparency initiative Property of the People, the FBI now regards the Proud Boys (the self-styled ‘pro-West fraternal organization’ founded by right-wing provocateur Gavin McInnes) as an extremist group linked to white nationalism.

As someone who’s met similar groups (I’ve stayed with anti-government militias in Kansas and California), I’m not convinced. In my experience, Proud Boy-style groups aren’t racist – if I had to define them, I’d say they’re obnoxious pro-Trumpers whose politics seem less about making America great again and more about antagonizing the other side.

Sure, they tend to be strongly anti-immigration and un-PC more generally – but white nationalist? That seems like serious overreach on the part of the FBI (not least because the Proud Boys have plenty of non-white members).

I suspect the FBI’s classification might have been influenced by the Southern Poverty Law Centre which recently added the Proud Boys to its list of hate groups. But while the SPLC has historically been regarded as the go-to resource on racist groups, it has faced justified criticism for expanding its definition of ‘hate’ to cover reactionary views more broadly. Their Proud Boys briefing is a case in point.

Away from extremism per se, the leaked memo blames the Proud Boys for an ‘escalation of violence at political rallies’. In my opinion, this charge is more complicated. The upsurge in political street-fighting is real, but it can’t be blamed solely on the Proud Boys (even if the group’s founder has courted controversy with his shock-jock claims that ‘fighting solves everything)’.

One of the most depressing features of America’s current culture war is the huge explosion in antagonistic rallies (on both the right and left). For the first year of Trump’s presidency, hardly a week passed without either a pro- or anti-Trump demonstration in a major city. These demos are inevitably met by counter-protests, some of which want to shut down the first demo altogether (the leftist network Antifa is notorious for this).

Factor in the hot-headed types who are drawn to groups like Proud Boys and Antifa, and it’s not hard to see how these scenarios spill-over into violence. But this isn’t dangerous extremism: it’s mindless thuggery barging into the culture war. It’s an indictment of American political debate that either side sees itself as engaging in any kind of noble struggle, rather than merely spoiling for a fight.

In such a situation, it’s not hard to sympathize with law enforcement. Policing these angry demonstrations places a huge demand on time and resources. But to call this an issue of ‘extremism’ – or to suggest the blame lies solely with the pro-Trump Proud Boys – is way off the mark.","That seems like serious overreach on the part of the FBI (not least because the Proud Boys have plenty of non-white members).

219,https://www.dawn.com/news/1447467,"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",DAWN.com,The Punjab villages where women no longer have to wait until the night to relieve themselves,"Several villages in Punjab now have access to toilets thanks to the efforts of a non-profit.

For as long as she can remember, Ayesha Siddiqua has fought her male relatives for access to toilets — but a sanitation drive by Prime Minister Imran Khan could make life easier for women in rural Pakistan.

“I told them: 'You can go where you want, but me, my movements are restricted!',” said Siddiqua, who is in her 60s, in Basti Ameerwala, a small agricultural village in central Punjab where residents have been relieving themselves in the open for generations.

Women in the village have long been forced to hide their bodily functions from the conservative, deeply patriarchal society, Siddiqua and other female residents told AFP.

Restraining themselves over long days working in the fields, they wait for night and the cover of darkness — braving snakes, dogs, or even unpleasant encounters with strange men, Siddiqua's daughter-in-law Tahira Bibi said, her face hidden by a brown veil.

“I would limit my consumption of water and eat less just to avoid going to the bathroom in the daytime,” the 35-year-old said, describing a ploy used by all the women interviewed by AFP in the region.

For the last month-and-a-half, however, Tahira Bibi has not had to wait. A small red-brick cottage housing a pastel green squat toilet has been erected in front of her house.

The initiative has come from a Pakistani non-profit, the Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP), whose team has ventured into the remote hamlet to preach hygiene — mainly, they say, to men.

Toilets 'not a priority' for men

Providing toilets is the responsibility of men in the region, according to Altaf Hussain, a programme officer for LPP.

“When we ask them, they are ashamed that their women have to defecate outside,” he said.

“So they tell us they have never thought about toilets. They are surely lying. They can spend money on TV, smoking, other things, but latrines are not a priority.”

Added to this, he says, is a cultural issue: “People see open defecation as routine, and as fertilisers for their soil. They are not aware of the consequences.”

The United Nations children's agency says 22 million Pakistanis relieve themselves in the open. In rural areas just 48 per cent of the population has access to toilets, compared with 72 per cent in the cities.

Some 53,000 children die each year from diarrhoea in Pakistan after consuming polluted water, according to UN data.

Typhoid, cholera, dysentery and hepatitis are common. Those who do not die “tend to see reduced capacity of their body to absorb nutrients”, says Kitka Goyol, a Unicef expert on water and hygiene. That can be a factor in stunting, which afflicts 44 per cent of Pakistani children.

Tahira Bibi says one of her four children died after “stomach problems”, while another was at one point in critical condition.

“We thought it was God's will,” she said soberly.

'Pride' in toilets

The UN, which marked World Toilet Day this week, says the lack of toilets costs Pakistan up to $2.5 billion per year.

Prime Minister Khan, who came to power in August, vowed last month to “eradicate the deficit of toilets in the country by 2023”.

His counterpart in neighbouring rival India, Narendra Modi, launched his own aggressive sanitation drive in 2014.

New Delhi claims it has slashed the number of people forced to defecate in the open from 550 million that year to less than 150 million today.

Khan's government, meanwhile, has launched “Clean Green Pakistan”, a massive social and environmental initiative seeking to shift behaviour in areas including sanitation, minister of climate change Malik Amin Aslam said. He did not offer details, however.

Non-profits such as LPP, which is not part of Clean Green Pakistan, are already paving the way in places like Basti Ameerwala, where 15 out of 60 households now have latrines.

In the neighbouring hamlet of Chah Jamalianwala, where LPP also works, 35 out of 60 houses have one, six of which have been built in recent weeks.

Mohammad Nasir, a frail man of 45, is one of the last to have taken the step.

Like many other men in the area, he did not consider a toilet a priority — having relieved himself in neighbouring fields for 28 years, and spending his money instead on a satellite dish, television and solar panel.

Finally, after his doctor warned him about his wife's health, his small field is equipped with roofless latrines. The construction cost him 15,000 rupees ($110), a month's salary — but, he says, he feels “pride” at finally having a toilet.","Several villages in Punjab now have access to toilets thanks to the efforts of a non-profit.

I met him briefly and spoke to him on the phone frequently for work purposes. And only now that he is gone, I remember his self-effacing dedication having instilled in me the importance of human solidarity and how crucial the mission of social workers and trade unionists was in our lives – even for those who think they ‘will never be left behind’. I just wish I had spoken to him a bit more while not on duty.

Just a week since his passing at the age of 62, I can be thankful for having met Gosden at a time in my life when my heart had not been hardened by the cynicism of political reporting. In 2002 or thereabouts, University of Malta visiting lecturer Gary Armstrong – whose work dealt with criminology and football – introduced us to the portly Gosden, a former trade unionist and social worker at a men’s shelter, with a hangdog expression which however exuded friendliness and patience.

Gosden was an enlightened connoisseur of diversity and precarity who in 2004 started running the Marsa open centre at a time when migrant rescues prompted far-right demonstrations out in the Maltese streets. He was then one of the first people on the ground dealing with Malta’s new migration phenomenon.

“How we treat people reflects on us as humans and generations to come” was a gentle affirmation of his that I still remember to this day. Today I think of that intonation as a simple prayer rather than some lofty quote. Gosden was surely a man dedicated to those left out on the margins of life and society.

In 2004, Gosden moved from the Gzira homeless shelter Dar Leopoldo that was managed by Fondazzjoni Suret il-Bniedem, to manage the Marsa centre, also run by the same foundation.

“His management style and attitude were remarkable,” said Graffitti activist Andre Callus, who got to know Gosden at the Marsa open centre while visiting friends who were seeking asylum. “He treated everyone as equal, a humble person with no power trips.”

Callus says that even in the prevailing climate of treating migration as a national ‘problem’, Gosden struck out by taking a democratic and participatory-based approach to management. “The centre was ‘open’ in all senses, to residents, their friends and organisations working in the field,” he says, pointing to the fact that Gosden wanted migrants to contribute to the running of the centre itself.

“His management was one of constant dialogue and empowerment; not a top-down approach of ‘control’, but one that recognised the residents’ belonging to the place and their potential in creating a positive space that made their difficult lives in Malta more bearable.”

Callus mentions as an example Gosden’s encouragement for migrants to open small businesses within the centre. “These varied from restaurants and internet cafes, to bike-repair, barbers and tailors. Clearly, there were also many challenges. The centre’s structure was dilapidated and managing a small place with hundreds of people from different countries was no easy task.

“However, although the place was often reviled in the media as a hub of problems, in reality it was a vibrant hub of empowerment, solidarity and friendship. This was thanks to Terry Gosden and his genuine belief in the values of equality and human solidarity.”

He left Marsa in 2008, resigning abruptly after being subordinated by a board decision that wanted to introduce new management.

But he reappeared at the unlikeliest of places, as a specialist on third country nationals for the General Workers Union, just as the left-wing union was being accused of adopting a sceptic and at times, abrasive line on irregular immigration and asylum.

Notoriously, in 2008 GWU secretary-general Tony Zarb presented a policy document outlining principals on equal treatment for third country nationals, where he said that immigrant workers had become “a national scourge for our country”. In the same breath, Zarb pledged he would train his section secretaries on how best to handle Malta’s immigration issues. Which is where Gosden came in.

“We are now recognising that there is a new generation of people making up a new working class in Malta, who – because of their precarious position – are more in danger of being exploited and therefore require protection,” Gosden had said, underlying why the GWU had to look out for this unregulated workforce.

Gosden was a critic of the alarmist and right-wing discourse against migrants, often saying it was exaggerated to speak of a ‘crisis’ or ‘invasion’ in Malta. “I think some people are calling the current situation an invasion because they have the wrong information. I think we are failing to inform the public in a simple and logical format.”

Gosden knew that the Maltese public had a right to good information on asylum and migration, and had realised that the world had caught up with ‘welcoming and friendly’ Malta. “It’s in our generation’s hands now. What we do today will reflect on how future generations in Malta will live tomorrow.”

He embodied the values of trade unionism, by looking at asylum seekers not as a mere ‘identity’ section of society, but as part of the universal workforce itself. “It becomes automatic that a forward-thinking, progressive union protects workers regardless of their age, identity, skin colour, sexual orientation, religious belief or disability. These are the traditional pillars of the trade union movement, and I am very pleased that the GWU stands by this ideal.”

Today Gosden would walk down St Joseph High Street in Hamrun to see his own prediction having come true. “I think that integration in Malta is being led by the migrants themselves,” he had said. “They live in communities and even by purchasing everyday goods, they become consumers and get in contact with people, neighbourhoods and communities.

“They take part in community activities in churches or mosques, and therefore, create for themselves a network within the Maltese community. This way, they are judged on their abilities, honesty and integrity. This is how integration occurs.”

He saw asylum seekers as survivors of events that would have brought people like him to his knees. “The answer is not in Malta, it’s in Africa. What we do, and how we treat people, will reflect not only on us as human beings, but also on generations to come who are relying on us to make the right choices. I see no crisis, but a challenge.”

The tributes that poured in on Facebook came from former collaborators, such as the academic and former IOM liaison Maria Pisani who called Gosden a pioneer in the field of social justice. “It was a privilege to know him and work with him. You will be missed Terry.”

“I am sad and shocked,” said University pro rector Carmen Sammut. “Terry was an anchor in a sea of panic and mistrust.”

Terry Gosden died in Cornwall on 7 November, 2018.

221,http://edition.mv/features/8040,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Edition,'No More'; Taking domestic violence seriously,"Violence by any measure, or in any shape or form, is unacceptable.

By the same measure, domestic violence is no lesser form of violence - in fact, it is often the most pervasive form of violence in a society.

Take as an example the typical domestic worker, who has abusive names and xenophobic slurs casually tossed at her on a daily basis. Or the dependant wife, whose intimate photos face frequent threats of being exposed, words spoken in shaking rage, when musters courage to tell you she is filing for divorce.

It is the hands that the mother, on the brink of losing sanity, raised in her frustrations at her children - including you. The relative, who abuses the trust placed on him by advancing unwelcome attempts to touch your intimate corners, leaving you feeling unsafe and violated - for a lifetime.

These are just a few forms of domestic violence that many of us experience every day.

How could something that sounds so familiar, be considered ""abuse""?

Well, broadly speaking, domestic violence is understood to be violence or any other abuse by one person against another, that takes place in a domestic setting.

Six years ago, Maldives joined the ranks of a growing number of countries that also have specific law(s) or a form of legal provision, targetting the prevention of domestic violence.

As such, The Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (2012) is a hallmark piece of legislation that sets out special procedures for redress and safeguards to protect survivors of domestic violence.

Recognising violence

Most often than not, between the sacred layers of love and trust that exist in domestic relationships (and rightly should exist in such relationships), we fail to identify abusive or controlling behaviour that harms us.

Awareness about what constitutes domestic violence is a key step in recognising violence.

Domestic violence can take many forms and under the 2012 Act, it includes, inter alia, inflicting physical, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse, harassing, threatening or stalking, inflicting financial abuse and/or property damage, impregnating your wife against a medical doctor’s advice, impregnating a woman who wants to leave an abusive marriage, restricting free movement of a person, in fact even detaining a person, forcing someone to do something that she would not do in her own free will and subjecting a child to see or hear any of the above acts.

Sometimes, a form of violence may happen in isolation, however mostly, they are interconnected and is safe to say, a person who experiences one form of domestic violence also suffers from another, such as emotional abuse.

Your friend, sister or perhaps even your daughter

The now infamous “1 in 3” is a global figure, statistically derived to indicate that about 1 in 3 women experience some form of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in their lifetime.

Now, one may dub it ""just a figure"" and dismiss it at face value, perhaps understandably so if one has not gone through such an experience.

However if one can muster a modicum of empathy to look beyond our own circumstances, the following statistics may reveal the imminence and prevalence of such forms of violence, even in a community as small as ours.

Right here in Maldives, amongst women between the ages of 15 - 49 years old that had been in a relationship, 1 in 5 reported having experienced physical and/or sexual violence inflicted by an intimate partner.

Approximately 1 in 8 women of the same age group reported that they were sexually abused before the age of 15. In other words, they reported having suffered childhood sexual abuse.

The above data comes from the Maldives Study on Women’s Health and Life Experiences conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of Gender and Family and mirrors global statistics in the same regard. Remember? 1 in 3 women aged 15-49 reported experiencing at least one form of physical or sexual violence, or both, during their lifetime.

To put it simply, consider your immediate circle of loved ones, amongst the now significantly more real and worrisome “1 in 3”, must surely be your friend, sister or perhaps even your daughter.

You can become an agent of change

As someone who has been working with survivors for some time now, I have observed that today, even in the time of global movements like MeToo, many of us continue to suffer domestic violence in silence, for long periods of time.

When asked, survivors often respond by saying that they feel that they lack the support system of empathy and trust from their inner circle of family and friends, that would allow them to share their experiences.

This year, we celebrate the sixth anniversary since the 2012 Act came into effect. Six years, which I'm sure we can agree, barely amounts to a blink of an eye in the lifetime of a nation.

However it must be noted that, within these six years, the state and government institutions and civil society organisations of Maldives, have made remarkable progress in setting up and enhancing protection mechanisms on domestic violence.

As individuals, by merely becoming aware about the available protection mechanisms we can help someone who experiences domestic violence.

If I were to choose any one step as the first, it would be this: if anybody speaks to you about experiencing domestic violence, take them seriously.

Offer a listening ear, empathize without judgement and help them to report it to the Maldives Police Service (Family and Child Protection Department), Family Protection Authority or Ministry of Gender and Family.

If the person happens to reside in an island that is not Male’ City, do refer them to the family and children service centres based in every atoll or to the nearest local police station.

If the survivor fears for her own life, you can help them by reporting the case, even anonymously. If a person speaks of physical or sexual abuse, take them to see a doctor or at least encourage them to consult with one and have a medical check-up done.

If someone speaks about emotional abuse or trauma, try to direct them to the free counselling service available from the Society for Health Education (SHE).

Most importantly, if someone is in a life-threatening situation or at imminent risk of threat and harm, report it to police and ask her to file an emergency protection order with the Family Court or the respective Magistrate Court.

In other situations, one can always file a protection order with the court. If someone needs legal advice, there is always the free legal help provided by our Family Legal Clinic, accessible even via our toll-free helpline.

All we need is a change in perspective

In order to realise a real social change in this regard, I believe the work starts within ourselves.

A helpful beginning step is to recognise domestic violence when it happens to us, as well as when it happens to others because of us or our actions.

Take for example your domestic worker, whose one little mistake or slack costs her having to listen to abusive names and xenophobic slurs. There is an alternative course of action one could take if one is willing to take responsibility for his or her own actions and identify it as a form of domestic violence. For instance, recognize and remember that she has a name and call your domestic worker by her chosen identity.

Real change follows real actions, actions that all of us are at liberty to take. Together, we can change the fate of women and girls in our country, not just on paper but by eliminating abuse for all of us, permanently.

Editor's Note: This article was originally written for “Our Shared Stories”, a publishing column run by the Family Legal Clinic. The original article addresses domestic violence suffered by both men and women. As we mark 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence, this article has been adapted to discuss domestic violence in the context of women.","By the same measure, domestic violence is no lesser form of violence - in fact, it is often the most pervasive form of violence in a society.
Well, broadly speaking, domestic violence is understood to be violence or any other abuse by one person against another, that takes place in a domestic setting.
As such, The Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (2012) is a hallmark piece of legislation that sets out special procedures for redress and safeguards to protect survivors of domestic violence.
Awareness about what constitutes domestic violence is a key step in recognising violence.
As we mark 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence, this article has been adapted to discuss domestic violence in the context of women."

The brief recommends that States with high levels of internal displacement address the needs of IDPs in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that countries include information on IDPs in their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

Authored by Alice Debarre, Archibald Henry and Masooma Rahmaty, IPI, the brief explores links between internal displacement and the SDGs, highlights ongoing efforts to address the longer-term needs of IDPs, looks at the specific cases of Nigeria and Iraq, and provides recommendations for ways forward. The brief titled, ‘Reaching Internally Displaced Persons to Achieve the 2030 Agenda,’ notes the need to understand international displacement as a long-term challenge that requires coordinated and complementary approaches by humanitarian and development actors.

The authors define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence… and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border,” in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 1998 by the UN Special Representative on IDPs and represent an international framework that “authoritatively restates the rights” of IDPs, as enshrined in international human rights and humanitarian law. The 30 principles cover IDPs’ needs during displacement, return, resettlement and reintegration, and have gained broad international acceptance and authority, although they were never officially adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The brief recalls that the 2030 Agenda pledges to “leave no one behind” and highlights IDPs as a vulnerable group that must be empowered through efforts to implement the SDGs. While there are no SDG targets or indicators specifically related to internal displacement, the brief notes, the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity to build on existing efforts and ensure that the plight of IDPs is addressed in both the short and long terms. It states that many of the SDGs are directly related to IDPs, and including IDPs in policies to implement the SDGs could help reduce the occurrence and impact of displacement and ensure that IDPs contribute to local economies and economic growth. In this regard, the authors report that Nigeria has included IDPs in its VNR, and linked the issue particularly with SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

The authors also remark that neither the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration nor the Global Compact for Refugees address the issue of internal displacement. They explain that some States perceive international attention to IDP issues as an infringement on their sovereignty and have therefore been reluctant to address it in multilateral fora.

The brief reports that, as of May 2018, there are over 40 million IDPs due to conflict and violence in the world, which is nearly twice the number of refugees worldwide. Also, since they are displaced within national borders, IDPs do not benefit from the legal status of refugees and its associated protections, and fall outside of the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Among other challenges to addressing IDPs’ needs, the authors note that the different funding streams of humanitarian and development actors and the existing field architecture for UN agencies inhibit efforts to operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus, while being not conducive to joint action or collective outcomes. The authors also cite inadequate collection, processing, and sharing of data on IDPs, and the fact that supporting IDPs is not traditionally perceived as a development issue and is insufficiently included in development strategy and planning.

On initiatives that have been taken at the international level regarding IDPs, the authors outline: the April 2018 launch of the multistakeholder ‘GP20 Plan of Action for Advancing Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People 2018– 2020;’ the development, by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), of a framework for addressing internal displacement; and the establishment, in 2018, of a UN Joint Steering Committee in charge of advancing humanitarian and development collaboration and assessing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, following the UN Secretary-General’s proposal to reform the UN development system.

The brief also notes that 37 States sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General in July 2018 asking him to appoint a high-level panel on IDPs in order to bring attention to existing efforts and galvanize continuing action.

223,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/development-co-operation-report-proposes-framework-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Development Co-operation Report Proposes Framework to Leave No One Behind,"11 December 2018: The 2018 edition of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Co-operation Report addresses how UN Member States can deliver on the SDGs’ commitment to leave no one behind. The report identifies what such a commitment means in practice, reviews the latest evidence on reaching the most vulnerable and marginalized populations, and discusses ways in which development cooperation policies, financing and programming can be made fit for purpose to realize the ambition of the SDGs.



Leaving no one behind, the authors assert, centers on inclusion, equity and sustainability, and cannot be achieved through economic growth alone. Chapter 3 identifies eight issues requisite to leaving no one behind: ending extreme poverty; tackling rising income inequality; addressing fragility; enabling inclusive governance; taking action on climate; empowering women and achieving gender equality; including young people in sustainable development; and ensuring that persons with disabilities are no longer left behind.

Success in these areas requires an understanding of their multidimensional drivers, the acceleration of progress for poor people, and the confronting of discrimination and vulnerability. The report thus issues a call for donors to update development cooperation frameworks, noting that providers need to “make new deliberate, systematic and coordinated efforts to adapt their narratives, management practices and financing to maximize individual and collective impact.”

According to the report’s highlights document and executive summary note, such efforts manifest in three ways. They demand:

A new narrative that spells out the mutual benefits of leaving no one behind for everyone; The deliberate mainstreaming of the objective of inclusive, equitable and sustainable development through development cooperation portfolios, and harnessing agents of change, innovation and data; and Smarter use and allocation of Official Development Assistance (ODA) as an integral part of broader efforts to increase the volume of financing to achieve the SDGs for all.

Strategic challenges to address – noted in Chapter 4 – include investment, policies and data. The report emphasizes that means of overcoming them include strong institutions and policy coherence, which can help coordinate actions and create an enabling environment that fosters the raising of additional financial resources. Civil society and the private sector, covered in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively, also play a significant role, through on-the-ground, mission-driven work, the filling of data gaps, and the provision of jobs and services for the poor. On financing for development (FFD) more broadly, Chapter 10 explores actions to mobilize greater volumes and more targeted allocations of finance, with emphases on external private investment, domestic public resources and official development finance.

A final section of the report profiles all OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members individually, as well as other development cooperation providers reporting to the OECD (including the United Arab Emirates and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and provides estimates for UN Member States that provide development cooperation but do not report to the OECD, such as Brazil and China.

The report also includes a series of opinion pieces by OECD staff, civil society and government leaders. These articles, featured throughout the report, augment the main analyses and findings by highlighting the imperative to make growth more inclusive, demanding new ways of working on humanitarian issues and fulfilling aid commitments, and fostering collaborative approaches to joining forces.

A series of case studies accompanies the report, and highlights experiences from a range of projects and programmes in reaching the furthest behind. They are presented under two categories: 1) reaching and including people and places; and 2) the enabling role of international cooperation – policies, partnerships and data.

The report is also complemented by a set of data visualizations that project current trends and compare scenarios in areas of poverty, hunger and aid.

224,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/leaving-no-one-behind-conveys-a-paternalistic-approach-to-development/,"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,'Leaving no one behind' conveys a paternalistic approach to development,"The term “leaving no one behind,” now at the centre of a United Nations framework and campaign, has gained centre stage in the era of sustainable development goals (SDGs).

It does not stop there: leaving no one behind is also now prevalent among the public health academics, development agencies and organisations that aspire to realise development goals, like not-for-profit bodies and civil society organisations.

In a recent health systems global conference in Liverpool, England, the term was thrown around, presented, used and dissected throughout. That’s despite the fact that while the term purports to advocate for inclusivity and progressive universalism, it also conveys a subtle message of paternalism.

The undesirable interpretations of the term can be understood from two perspectives: a paternalistic view of the marginalised and an ecological view of our shared planet.

The United Nations Declaration on Sustainable Development refers to leaving no one behind in the preamble and then also in the fourth section:

“As we embark on this great collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. Recognising that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society. And we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first.”

Elizabeth Stuart and Emma Samman of the Overseas Development Institute argue that “leaving no one behind” captures three concepts: ending extreme poverty in all its forms, reducing inequalities and addressing discriminatory barriers.

The paternalistic perspective

We argue the term “leaving no one behind” assumes there is a direction to development. The assumption is that the high-income countries are ahead and the low-income countries are behind. Within countries, the term exacerbates the social stratification among the groups of people who are ahead (the affluent, the privileged and the elites), the groups of people who are behind (the poor and the marginalised) and the groups of people who are in between (the middle class).

One of the assumptions in “no one left behind” arguments is that no one wants to be poor. Certainly, while nobody wants to remain in a state of extreme poverty, some may choose not to over-consume. They may reject living in a state of unnecessary abundance.

But because there is an apparent movement towards a direction of affluence as total fulfilment, there is even a sense that people who are middle class will be left behind if they don’t move “up” or “forward” over time.

And it often happens that people born into poverty are systemically unable to increase their wealth or class status.

Development expert Franz von Roenne has drawn an image to illustrate the notion of leaving no one behind in this linear track of development:

Image: Franz von Roenne

The image clarifies a number of points. First, the notion of “left behind” makes sense only from the perspective of those who are, or successfully claim, to be ahead. Second, the assumption or the expectation that those with power and access to resources will follow a moral impulse and they know better how to upgrade the lives of people who are “behind” is paternalistic.

The image echoes colonialist attitudes and ways of thinking epitomised in the phrase “the white man’s burden,” based on the Rudyard Kipling poem and now also the title of a book by economist William Easterly that criticises the failures of Western development.

Third, the paternalistic ideology runs a risk of discounting the agency of the marginalised and the resiliency of the poor. Psychologically, the stigma attached to the term “behind” can further hamper the capability of the marginalised to prosper.

What’s more, the term “leaving no one behind” presents a neutral tone and obscures the mechanisms through which some are already ahead.

What about the historical, political, economic and social factors that have caused several groups of population to be “left behind?”

Ronald Labonté, a globalisation and health equity researcher, asks in his article about global social inclusion: “How can one ‘include’ people and groups into structured systems that have systematically ‘excluded’ them in the first place?”

“ If sustainability of the Earth is the measure, those ahead of the development pack are actually behind.

An ecological perspective

From an ecological perspective, sustainability is as important, if not more so, as development. We believe development could be conceived as a process towards a satisfactory and stable equilibrium of living conditions for all.

We must not forget that we are all together in our only home, planet Earth, and if it does not remain sustainable for human living, development is futile.

Our survival as humans remain dependent on the survival of the Earth. Given the direction of development is towards the high-income countries, if everyone in the world consumed as much as an average American, four Earths would be needed to sustain ourselves.

The World Bank has classified countries based on their income levels of high, middle and low. The ecological footprints of an average person living in a high-income country is much bigger, and thus worse for sustainability, than those in low-income and middle-income countries.

If sustainability of the Earth is the measure, those ahead of the development pack are actually behind.

Giving a central role to “leaving no one behind” will not on its own help sustainable development. Other measures are needed to shift the balance—measures that are explicitly part of, or supplement, the plan at the foundation of sustainable development goals.

Inclusion of everyone in the development processes, and social accountability of all of us towards the sustainability of planet Earth, are the more desirable terms.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

I am the person of Azintanaab Mercy, a form two student of Siniensi Junior High School and I am here to discuss the topic; Sustainable Developmental Goals also known as Global Goals.

Someone may ask, what are Sustainable Development Goals? They are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. There are seventeen Global Goals. These include; No poverty, Zero hunger, Good health and well-being, Quality education, Affordable and clean energy, Decent work and economic growth, Reduced Inequalities, Sustainable cities and communities, Responsible consumption and production, Climate action, Life in water, Life on land, Peace, justice and strong institutions, and Partnerships for the goals. I would like to talk on the number one and key goal, which is no poverty.

The UN have been working very hard to do away with poverty in member countries globally. Poverty is indeed the major cause of almost all the problems in our communities. Come to talk of teenage pregnancy, school dropout. Both the young and the old abuse drugs and take alcohol to get over their frustrations caused by poverty. Again, the challenge of rural-urban migration, where most of our youth from rural areas especially the North, travel to some cities like Accra and Kumasi in search of non-existing jobs for survival. And the depletion of our forest, we cut down trees for firewood and to produce charcoal for sale to get money for our basic needs. And a lot of others. It is therefore very clear that, when we do away with poverty, all our problems will be solved. And how do we do this? It is a collective effort of you and I, our government and NGOs.

According to the Ghana Poverty and Inequality Report, using the 6th Ghana living standards, it is stated that between 1992 and 2013 Ghana’s national level of poverty fell more than half (from 56.5% to 24.2%), and in the Upper East Region alone, it dropped from 72.9% in 2006 to 44.4% in 2013. This is a positive call for us to fight poverty together.

I think if we should put these measures in place, we can solve this problem in our country and the world at large.

To begin with, I as a leader, and you as leaders, have to stay in the Builsa land, take our studies seriously in order to pass our exams, achieve our ambitions and help our land. Help our parents in their economic activities like agriculture and trade rather than travelling to cities in search of jobs like chop bar attendant, which is not even decent enough to solve poverty.

In addition, governmental and non-governmental organisations together with the two District Assemblies of Buluk should help setup businesses for the people, especially for disabled persons in order to reduce unemployment in our society, which will help them to gain enough income for their basic needs. This will end poverty.

Moreover, our government should help improve our farming, through the construction of irrigation dams, gardens and the provision of agro-chemicals to farmers to cultivate food crops even in the dry season, and a source of water for our animals which will be an economic gain for the people.

To add to that, sensitizing the people on agriculture and other business methods. The two Districts of the Builsa land should send people from their Agric offices to educate farmers on agricultural benefits and improved and appropriate farming methods to increase yields.

In conclusion, government should improve the road network in our Districts so that farmers will be able to transport and sell their foodstuffs. As for the need to construct our existing roads, I Azintanaab Mercy will not tell you as we can see for ourselves whenever we go to Sandema, Siniensi, Wiaga, Fumbisi, Chuchuliga, and many other places in the Districts. Lets all come together to fight poverty. Thank you for listening.

The CCPI aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics by highlighting countries with best practice climate policies and noting those countries that have failed to take ambitious climate action.

The 2019 CCPI measures countries’ performances in three categories: GHG emissions; renewable energy; and energy use. For each category, the Index analyzes countries based on their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change to determine if they are on track to a below 2°C pathway. Each category includes four indicators on recent developments, current levels, 2°C compatibility of the current performance and an evaluation of the countries’ 2030 targets in each category.

The Index finds that “no country performed well enough to reach the ranking very good” in the 2019 Index. Sweden, Morocco, Lithuania, Latvia and the UK lead the rankings with high ratings. France, Mexico, Germany and the Czech Republic fall into the medium performing countries. Indonesia, Austria and New Zealand rank as low performers. The bottom five performers on the 2019 Index are Saudi Arabia, the US, Iran, the Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei.

No country performed well enough to reach the very good ranking.

On GHG emissions, when considering emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), Sweden leads the ranking, followed by Egypt and Malta. On renewable energy, Latvia performed the best, followed by Sweden and New Zealand. Morocco had the greatest improvement among countries in this category, moving to the medium performing countries. On energy use, Ukraine, Malta, Morocco and Romania ranked the highest, mostly due to their low current levels of energy use. The Index observes that emerging economies tend to perform well on the energy use category but some countries, such as Thailand, Turkey, Algeria, India and Indonesia, have increased their energy use over the past few years.

In addition, the 2019 Index includes a category on climate policy. This category recognizes that measures taken by governments to reduce GHG emissions can take several years to reflect on emissions, renewable energy and energy use indicators. On climate policy, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Morocco all scored high on national and international climate policy. Australia, Turkey and the US are among the worst performing countries, performing low on national climate policy as well as “hindering progress in international negotiations.” The Index further observes that some countries, including Germany, Canada and the UK, “perform relatively well on the international stage” yet fail to implement policy measures at the national level.

The CCPI website provides interactive maps and tables that display results for all 56 countries and the EU as well as country-specific scorecards. The CCPI has tracked countries efforts to combat climate change for the past 14 years. Its 2019 edition was launched during the Katowice Climate Change Conference, meeting in Poland from 2-14 December 2018.

That May Not Be All Bad,"On few issues has the Trump administration thumbed its nose at the global community more belligerently than on climate change. In November, the Trump administration released an alarming climate report compiled by federal agencies, and immediately dismissed its significance. When G-20 leaders meeting in Argentina wanted to adopt strong language on the need to address climate change, Trump demanded special language exempting the United States. This month, when 44 small island nation states rose at the global climate conference in Poland to urge similarly strong language acknowledging the most recent international climate report, almost all of the rest of the world rose in affirmation. But the Trump administration derailed their efforts. Much of the coverage of these events has derided Trump’s actions as emblematic of his disregard for climate science. “This is a new frontier of disavowance of science, of disdain for facts,” said William K. Reilly, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush. In this slow-shutter zoom effect photo, commuters backed up in traffic during the morning rush hour Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018, in Brussels, a city that regularly experiences pollution alert warnings. (Francisco Seco/AP) But to describe this as a debate over science or facts misses something crucial. This is no longer a debate about science; it is a debate about values. And the Trump administration, for all its deceit and corruption, has been ploddingly predictable in explaining why taking action on climate change is supposedly a “bad deal for the U.S.”

In Trump’s view, what is at stake is not the science of climate change, but international competitiveness, energy abundance, faith in technological innovation and American exceptionalism. This marks an under-appreciated change in the debates over climate policy. In 2001, President George W. Bush explained that he wanted a “science-based approach” to global climate change. What that meant to Bush’s allies in the fossil fuel industry was that if they wanted to advance their policy agenda, the best way to do so was to challenge climate science. That became the playbook for groups like the George C. Marshall Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute. With the support of the fossil fuel industry, they spent decades attacking climate science — dogging scientists, publishing misleading reports, and trying to sway the media with disinformation campaigns. The Bush White House was notorious for line editing government climate reports to emphasize uncertainties and downplay the need to address climate change. The Trump administration’s approach has been different. Although it has cut funding for climate science research, weakened scientific advisory committees, and cast doubt on climate science, it has also released a string of urgent climate studies that directly contradict its policy positions. Instead of undermining the science, Trump has largely ignored it. Consider Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord in June 2017. In retrospect, what is most telling about that announcement is what Trump did not say. He made almost no mention of climate science, nor did he question the reality of climate change. Instead, he based his decision to withdraw from the accord almost entirely on economic concerns and matters of international competitiveness. Trump explained that, in his view, he has to do “everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth.” For him, keeping the United States ahead of China, expanding domestic energy production, and protecting jobs for coal miners come first, not future and uncertain concerns about climate change. For those who understand the gravity of scientists’ warnings about climate change, this presents an opportunity and a challenge. Rather than more urgent science or compelling facts, the debate over climate change is increasingly one about competing values and alternative visions for the future. To win the debate over climate change means swaying the public with a vision, not with facts.

228,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/nine-jobs-george-poverty-british-workers-failing-wages,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Nine-jobs George has no idea about the poverty many British workers face | Stefan Stern,"At the risk of adding to the Christmas repeats: what about the workers? It’s a traditional question, but a good and necessary one. The official figures seem to reveal a fairly positive picture. There are high levels of employment, while unemployment remains low in spite of economic uncertainty. Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics said that pay was now growing at an above-inflation rate of 3.3%.

But then there is the nightmare before Christmas, the reality of what working people are actually experiencing. And it is this: adjusted for inflation, people are still getting paid less on average than they were 10 years ago – almost £500 a year less, according to the Resolution Foundation. And according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, wages will not return to their pre-financial crisis peak until at least 2024. New research from the TUC has found that pay is worth a third less in some parts of the country than a decade ago. The average worker has lost a total of £11,800 in real earnings since 2008, the TUC says, the worst real-wage slump among leading economies.

That is the more rounded picture of what is going on in the labour market – quite impressive job creation, but too often at very low rates of pay. This services-driven economy of ours fills warehouses with pressured fetchers and carriers, packs out our roads with delivery drivers and cycle couriers, and makes sure you get served a drink or a meal in bars and restaurants, but it does not put enough bread on the table. The 1990s belief that “any job is better than no job” has been exposed as a (perhaps well-intentioned) delusion. Still the government repeats the claim that “the best way out of poverty is to get a job”. But given the rates of pay on offer in so many parts of the country, this simply isn’t true either.

More than half a million British workers have fallen into poverty in the last five years, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, bringing the total to around four million. Feeble wage growth, in addition to reductions in tax credits, benefits cuts and the high cost of housing have combined to produce this lethal state of affairs. Some 4.5 million children are now living in poverty – nine out of 30 children in an average classroom.

It is little consolation to say that things could be worse. Without the introduction of a national minimum wage (NMW) 20 years ago there would be even more poverty pay than there is today. And this government did at least aim a bit higher when, in 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne set a target for the NMW of £9 an hour for the over-25s by 2020 (although that target is probably going to be missed).

Ah yes, Osborne. Did you know he’s just bagged his ninth job? Perhaps this is the clinching piece of evidence that times really are hard for everyone. The £650,000 a year from Blackrock and the reported £200,000 for editing the Evening Standard are apparently not quite enough. The serious point is that the failure of David Cameron and Osborne to recognise the realities of life in the economy they presided over – and they were not alone in placing too much faith in apparently reassuring aggregate data – has delivered us the fractured, unhappy country we are today.

What was the vote for Brexit if not, in large part, a rejection of the sunny economic story Dave and George were telling us all? “Project Fear” failed because so many people didn’t think things could get any worse. It was no use saying “vote remain or the country gets it”. A lot of people felt utterly got at already.

Even that positive news about a rise in the NMW was undermined by the cynical sleight of hand that accompanied it – a renaming of the NMW as a “national living wage”. There is a real living wage, calculated by social scientists at Loughborough University, and it is a good deal higher (currently £10.55 an hour in London and £9 in the rest of the country) than the fake “NLW”. This dishonest spray-job is typical of what has gone wrong with economic management in recent years. Politicians in Westminster have told the country that all is more or less fine. But the country doesn’t believe it. The queues at the food banks tell a different and more convincing story.

Most people do deserve a pay rise after years of falling real wages. But there is a lot of ground to be made up. And, sadly, 3.3% of naff all is naff all.","Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics said that pay was now growing at an above-inflation rate of 3.3%.

During a Thanksgiving Day teleconference with members of the US armed forces, US President Donald Trump took the opportunity to exult over the intensified militarisation of the nation’s southern border in response to the US-bound Central American migrant and refugee caravan:

“We have the concertina fencing and we have things that people don’t even believe. We took [the] old, broken wall and we wrapped it with barbed wire-plus … We’re fighting for our country. If we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country”.

Nevermind that the United States‘ disregard for other people’s borders is a major cause of Central American migration in the first place, as US political and economic meddling in the region continues to increase poverty and violence.

A certain ‘Nazi practice’

Now, the “barbed wire-plus” scheme has resulted in a situation in which thousands of asylum seekers are stuck on the Mexican side of the border waiting to have their cases processed, with black numbers written on their arms as part of an informal tracking system.

Even the ultra-Zionist Times of Israel – another country well known for its manic and deadly border fortification projects – felt compelled to note that the “marking of asylum seekers” recalled the “Nazi practice of tattooing prisoner numbers”.

Nor has “barbed wire-plus” worked out well for some of Trump’s fellow citizens as 32 people were recently arrested at a pro-migrant demonstration on the border, organised by a Quaker group. Time Magazine explains that the protest “was meant to launch a national week of action called Love Knows No Borders: A moral call for migrant justice, which falls between Human Rights Day on [December 10], and International Migrants’ Day on December 18″.

And as we mark this year’s International Migrants’ Day, right-wing efforts rage on to selectively criminalise not only migration but also human solidarity and empathy. After all, the prevailing capitalist system – in which the financial tyranny of the minority is predicated on the severance of interpersonal bonds – can’t really handle love.

Meanwhile in ‘fortress Europe’…

Across the Atlantic, European countries are flaunting their own borders, as xenophobia and the demonisation of the “other” are ever-handy means of detracting public attention from domestic malaise.

Take Italy, for example – a primary landing point for migrants from Africa and elsewhere and a wellspring of racist political rhetoric. During his successful campaign for president of the region of Lombardy earlier this year, Attilio Fontana warned Italian radio listeners about the perils of immigration: “We must decide whether our ethnicity, our white race, our society should continue to exist or should be erased”.

Meanwhile, far-right leader Matteo Salvini, who in 2018 acquired the posts of Italian interior minister and deputy prime minister, set about propagating the idea that Italy was “under attack” by Muslims. This apocalyptic scenario, he claimed, had been foretold by Oriana Fallaci, late Italian journalist-nutcase who had also excoriated US universities for allowing persons by the name of Mustafa and Muhammad to study biology and chemistry despite the threat of germ warfare.

Salvini pledged to deport half-a-million migrants as part of his vision of a “mass cleaning” of Italy. Upon assuming office, he declared Italian ports closed to migrant rescue vessels – the transparent murderousness of which policy was made clear by news headlines from around the same time: “Mediterranean: more than 200 migrants drown in three days”.

Eradicating ‘virtuousness’

In October, Domenico Lucano – mayor of the Italian town of Riace, which made a name for itself and flourished by welcoming migrants – was arrested, charged with abetting illegal immigration, and banned from the town.

The Guardian quoted Italian writer Gioacchino Criaco on the fundamental reasons for the arrest: “Efficiency and humanity are not welcomed in a cynical system. This is a system that only takes consensus from politics of fear. In this respect, examples of virtuousness must be eradicated”.

Elsewhere in Europe, too, eradication proceeds apace. In August, Sara Mardini – the Syrian refugee swimmer who along with her sister saved a boatload of refugees from drowning in 2015 – was thrown in prison in Athens for allegedly aiding illegal immigration. She was only recently released on bail.

This month, 15 activists in the United Kingdom were convicted for nonviolently blocking a deportation flight from London Stansted Airport in 2017. Ludicrously, they’ve been slammed with a terrorism-related charge that entails a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

So much for virtues.

Also this month, Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, announced that it and its partner SOS MEDITERRANEE had been “forced to terminate operations by the search and rescue vessel Aquarius”, credited with rescuing 30,000 people in international waters since February 2016.

Talk about toxic

MSF says that the decision came after a “sustained campaign, spearheaded by the Italian government and backed by other European states, to delegitimise, slander and obstruct aid organisations providing assistance to vulnerable people … [T]his campaign has undermined international law and humanitarian principles.”

An Al Jazeera article on the demise of the Aquarius observes that, in November, 24 people associated with the ship were “put under investigation by Italian prosecutors for ‘trafficking and illegal management of waste’ because the ship’s crew had labelled migrants’ clothing as ‘special waste’ rather than ‘toxic waste’.”

But if we want to talk about “toxic”, it seems a border-obsessed world of gross inequality is as good a place as any to start.

The pact, meant to foster cooperation on migration, was agreed in July by all 193 UN members except the United States, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting on Monday.

Ten countries, mostly in formerly Communist Eastern Europe, have pulled out. Six more, among them Israel and Bulgaria, are debating whether to quit, a UN spokesman said after the pact was adopted. He did not say whether the rest of the countries absent from the conference in Marrakesh might also pull out.

Pew reported that, “In Europe, majorities in Greece (82%), Hungary (72%), Italy (71%) and Germany (58%) say fewer immigrants or no immigrants at all should be allowed to move to their countries.”

“Large majorities in Israel (73%), Russia (67%), South Africa (65%) and Argentina (61%) say their countries should let in fewer immigrants,” the survey added. Israel at 73% had the second highest rate of respondents wanting fewer or no immigrants coming into the country - second only to Greece.

In every country surveyed, less than a third say their nation should allow more immigrants to enter.

Among the countries surveyed Israel has the second largest per-capita immigrant population. According to Pew, “Immigrants make up the largest shares of national populations in Australia (29%), Israel (24%), Canada (22%) and Sweden (18%). About 14% of the U.S. population is foreign born, a share comparable to that of Germany (15%), the UK (13%) and Spain (13%).”

231,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/06/jamaica-lgbt-rights-activists-pride-two-decades-of-progress-j-flag,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Welcome to Jamaica – no longer ‘the most homophobic place on Earth’,"Early one late summer morning, more than 200 people gathered under the lush canopy of Hope Gardens in Kingston, Jamaica, for a breakfast party.

The revellers ate – ackee, saltfish, fried plantain – and swayed to a soundtrack of dancehall and soca.

Same-sex couples danced together. A transgender woman strutted by in a flowing white dress adorned with a sash bearing the words: “Miss Supermodel Intl 2018”. The park was strung with rainbow banners for the fourth annual Pride JA celebrations. At about midday, the party wrapped up. A light rain eased the heat and the dancers went home to sleep.

It was all a far cry from the country that Time magazine called “the most homophobic place on Earth” in 2006. Yet that label has clung to Jamaica ever since, and with good reason. In a 2013 survey of 71 LGBT people conducted by Human Rights Watch, more than half said they had been victims of homophobic violence. Non-violent discrimination is even more pervasive, with bullying and exclusion faced in education, healthcare and within local communities.

The change has come through the dedication of activists, including the work of Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), the country’s largest LGBT rights organisation, which this month celebrates its 20th anniversary.

When the organisation launched on 10 December 1998, it caused outrage. A journalist in the Gleaner wrote at the time: “We are being prepared to accept seeing two men kissing, holding hands or sharing popcorn from the same bucket at the movies. Public reaction has, however, been hostile … for the next few years, at least, gay rights in our society, as far as road marches or public appearances are concerned, is a very dim possibility.”

Less than two decades later, J-Flag has made this “dim possibility” slightly brighter. Three years ago, the country held its first pride event when a flashmob of 15 LGBT people gathered in Kingston’s Emancipation Park, dressed in the colours of the rainbow. Since then, pride week has grown: a beach party last year attracted 1,200 people.

Pride celebrations have brought unprecedented visibility to the community. So has social media, which has allowed the organisation, and other groups campaigning for LGBT rights, to “humanise” gay people.

As a result, the former minister for justice and the mayor of Kingston have both spoken out publicly in support of the group. Policy change has not followed, however. Under the country’s colonial-era “buggery law”, anal sex is criminalised (sharing a legal clause with bestiality), as are acts of intimacy between two men.

But attitudes are changing. The first time J-Flag addressed parliament calling for changes to these laws, in 2001, they were not taken seriously or treated with respect. But the second time, in 2017, politicians listened courteously.

“That’s a huge step forward,” says Glenroy Murray, former associate director of programmes at the organisation. “People are willing to engage us, have us at the table and listen to our concerns.”

Jaevion Nelson, J-Flag’s executive director, says there has been a “public awakening” following two homophobic attacks in 2013 – one of them the murder of Dwayne Jones, who attended a party in women’s clothes. The 16-year-old’s death forced the discussion of LGBT rights into the public sphere.

The organisation itself has grown considerably since Nelson joined in 2010, aged 24, when there were just three employees. J-Flag now employs 14, with more than 200 volunteers recruited to help coordinate their growing number of events and activist programmes.

But, says Nelson, the lingering Time magazine headline is a hindrance. “It’s an unfair label,” he says, one that ignores the complex realities of discrimination and downplays the emergence of greater tolerance across the country. “It creates a lot of fear in people and paralyses the community. You think of yourself as the next victim of murder, rather than seeing yourself as an individual with agency.”

Before Jamaica could get to that point of tolerance, however, J-Flag activists had to learn to latch on to bigger themes. Their manifesto, the Gay Agenda, was aligned with the government’s Vision 2030 development plan. The organisation works to reduce the spread of HIV across the island, and campaigns for the environment.

“We try as best as possible to interrupt our voices in those broader discussions, and not just about LGBT issues, because we exist outside of that community, too,” says Suelle Anglin, J-Flag’s associate director of marketing, communication and engagement.

Murray echoes these sentiments. “It’s not about the trajectory of decriminalisation, anti-discrimination legislation and then marriage,” he says. “It’s about looking at the ways in which LGBT people aren’t able to live their best lives.”

This means prioritising changes to anti-discrimination laws, which don’t protect Jamaicans on the basis of sexual or gender identity, over the “largely symbolic” repeal of the “buggery” laws. It means promoting the LGBT message while presenting that community as part of wider Jamaican society, he says.

That’s why J-Flag held a breakfast party to celebrate pride in a uniquely Caribbean way. “It’s about placing queerness in Jamaican-ness,” says Murray, “and showing that the two can exist and have co-existed for years.”","Early one late summer morning, more than 200 people gathered under the lush canopy of Hope Gardens in Kingston, Jamaica, for a breakfast party.

Forty-one countries recognise only a man to be the head of the household; 27 countries still require that women obey their husbands by law; and 24 countries require women to have the permission of their husband or a legal guardian (such as a brother or father) in order to work.

One in six girls worldwide is still married before turning 18, despite the introduction of legislation increasing the legal age of marriage in more countries than ever, according to a new global gender index.

The numbers have decreased so slowly since 2012 that global advisers warn it could take a century before child marriage is eradicated for good.

In some African countries, women find it justifiable to take a good beating if they burn their meals Bathylle Missika, OECD development centre

Women still face legal restrictions over unwanted pregnancies in 119 countries, with only two countries having decriminalised abortion since 2012.

The Social Institutions and Gender Index (Sigi), published on Friday by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) development centre, shows that some progress has been made since the rankings list was last published, in 2014. Fifteen countries have delayed the legal age of marriage; 14 have enacted legislation to criminalise intimate partner violence; and three countries have criminalised female genital mutilation (FGM).

Globally, social acceptance of domestic violence has nearly halved, from 50% in 2012 to 27% today.

“The glass half full is that there’s been tremendous political will across countries to implement laws that were not there before, or to actually improve them, so that women’s rights are better protected, yet social norms remain a sticky point, and one that is very difficult to address,” said Bathylle Missika, head of the gender division at the OECD’s development centre.

“When it comes to domestic violence, one in three women in the world have been a victim of domestic violence, and 27% of the world’s female population think it’s acceptable to take a beating from their husband under certain circumstances.

“To me, this is the most shocking dimension: in some African countries, women find it justifiable to take a good beating if they burn their meals.”

The Sigi index measures how discriminatory laws, social norms and practices affect the lives of women and girls worldwide. It compares 180 countries (although only 120 of them have enough data to be included in the rankings) by evaluating four dimensions of a woman’s life: rights in the family (for instance, if she is forced into early marriage), physical integrity (her sexual and reproductive health and rights), access to productive and financial assets (such as land and workplace rights), and civil rights (political representation).

Countries in the Middle East and north Africa demonstrated the highest levels of discrimination, with Yemen the worst performer for the second time running. Cameroon is among a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa that were found to be highly discriminatory against women and girls, with the Philippines one of the worst offenders among several nations in south-east Asia.

Cameroonian women and girls face a multitude of challenges. Girls as young as 15 can be married with their parents’ permission. Abortion is illegal. Women are not protected from spousal rape, and are largely denied the chance to own land. Although FGM is criminalised, “breast ironing” – whereby a girl’s breasts are flattened using hard or heated objects, in order to delay puberty – is a popular method to stave off rape, teen pregnancy, or early marriage, the report claims.

Global figures on child marriage have failed to decline at a faster rate for various reasons, said Missika: “In some countries it is socially accepted and, while there might be a law [against it], you may not go to jail if you actually marry a minor.”

Missika pointed to Britain, where the legal age of consent is 18 but children aged 16 can be married with parental consent. “This goes against the main convention on the elimination of discrimination against women,” she said.

“What Sigi can help us do is hold these western countries to account too,” said Rachel George, a senior research officer in the gender equality and social inclusion team at the Overseas Development Institute.



“We can’t let the west – the US, the UK, Europe or even the Scandinavian countries that seem to always get all the fanfare for gender equality – think this doesn’t apply to them. Every country has some discrimination going on in some way, and some discrimination which may be pervasive, so keeping everyone on the hook is extremely important.”

Missika said a multi-agency approach was needed to address the many issues raised by the most recent index.

“This is not the world we want to leave to our children. Half the population in the world (47%) believes that men make better political leaders than women. Beyond some of the success stories and some of the setbacks [in the index], there are some global issues that advocacy still has a role to play,” she said.

“We all know that social norms are harder to make evolve, but it’s going to take work from different angles, on laws and norms, and it’s not because you have one that you have the other. This is what people have to understand: there is no final approach that works when it comes to implementing sustainable development goal five [gender equality]. It’s a whole-of-society approach and interventions have to be targeting the whole lifecycle of women.”","Progress on women’s rights has been far slower than expected across the world as a report shows underage marriage rates have barely come down this decade, while dozens of nations still legally prioritise men.

233,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/03/take-back-control-could-self-sufficiency-be-the-answer-to-a-no-deal-brexit,"Mon, 03 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Take back control – could self-sufficiency be the answer to a no-deal Brexit?,"In January 2017, my husband, Jared, and I moved our family from a semi in Ramsgate to a ramshackle house in rural Kent that came with two acres of mud. Our desire for change was born of the political, social and environmental turmoil. There was certainly a naive pursuit of the good life, but we were also reeling from the outcome of the Brexit referendum and feeling sick about Trump’s presidency. We needed a personal survival plan.

In the face of a world shifting in a direction we could no longer understand, predict or rely on (and despite having no practical skills or experience), we sought a shared vocation that was less tied to systems and structures that appeared to be wobbling. We planned to grow and raise some of our own food and – as wildfires, floods and landslides hinted at the impact of climate change – move towards a more sustainable way of life. It felt like a personal resistance that would be good for our family life and physical and mental health, as well as teaching us new skills.

Nearly two years on and we are mulching the fruit and vegetable garden as we wait to see if the Brexit plan will make it through parliament. Jared dumps wheelbarrow-loads of our own compost and leaf mould on the remnants of summer growing. I spread it out in a thick blanket over each square bed, starving the most pernicious weeds of light and making the 300-metre square look neat and ready to work again. The worms will do the work of digging it in and the roots I’ve left in the soil will hold it together and help keep the microbial life of our garden thriving. As I rake, I wonder if parliament could do with a couple of thousand tonnes of mulch about now.

Making time for these kind of jobs alongside our freelance careers is harder than we had anticipated. Balancing the care of chickens, ducks, geese and goats – not to mention two children aged five and eight – while growing and preserving food, making our house more fit for sustainable living and clinging on to threads of sanity is too much at times. Our new life is often lovely and we are very grateful for it. Yet it’s also full of hard, time-consuming work that can feel endless and that we have to shoehorn into slivers of time.

Progress is slow. We have put in a log burner and acquired a few months’ supply of seasoned logs in a neighbourly exchange of old fencing posts. That, alongside new external insulation and triple glazing, will help us need less electricity – handy should prices hike upwards in spring. The money ran out before we could install solar panels to allow us more freedom from the grid and minimise our carbon footprint. Instead we are considering all-in-one woollen underwear.

The garden has been neglected after a busy summer. I am behind in my winter growing schedule and haven’t yet bought a polytunnel. With the stability of the food supply chain in question at the time of Brexit, our new skills could come into their own if I do my gardening due diligence. November is too late for planting much outdoors, but I will get a head start on spring with garlic sets, over-wintering onions and broad beans. I might try my hand at windowsill salad growing or ask for an indoor cultivation set for Christmas.

The renewed interest in grow-your-own and self-sufficiency can be seen in the vast array of books and products for aspiring home producers. Fermentation, pickling and preserving have gone from being niche interests to fashionable pursuits. Although allotment numbers seem to have plateaued after a recent sharp rise, community growing schemes are expanding rapidly. Chris Blythe, the director of the Social Farms & Gardens network, notes a substantial increase in the number of community food-growing projects across the UK over the past decade, “clearly linked”, he says, “to a number of social- and health-related concerns including austerity, the need for better connected communities, the health and wellbeing agenda, and the growing awareness of food security as a concern for all”.

Claire Harris (not her real name) runs a food co-operative in Wales alongside a small community garden. After supplying local cooking projects with ingredients, and donating a significant amount to a nearby food bank, Harris has little left for herself, particularly as a long winter and summer drought have taken a toll on the harvest. She wishes she could be more self-sufficient, feeling that the “government and business don’t give a damn about us”. In a month when the UN’s special rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights has accused the British government of needlessly inflicting “great misery” on its people with austerity measures (as indicated by the soaring use of food banks), it is hard not to sympathise with her view.

Perhaps it’s not surprising that we’re far from the only idealists whose dreams of self-sufficiency are mingled with political concerns. Amy Walker, 33, and her partner moved to a Kentish farmhouse in July this year and are trying to become as self-reliant as possible while preparing for a worst-case Brexit scenario. Their property was chosen for its potential to provide its own heating and it has an on-site water source. Walker and her partner are busy transforming their garden from lawn to “a productive garden that we can live off if Brexit doesn’t get stopped”. They plan to grow root vegetables, which can be stored or traded, are constructing a greenhouse for more tender crops and are using a damp nook to grow mushrooms.

Our own vegetable store is emptier than I would like; slugs ravaged the squash plants, the caterpillars got my cabbages and I ran out of time to do a second sowing of carrots. I do have a lot of potatoes: desiree, arran victory and cara varieties, grown from seed potatoes I planted in the spring. I dug them up with my children this month and they shrieked with delight as they uncovered the mysterious purple and pink shapes. I’ll cure the potatoes before storing them in the basement; its high humidity and constant temperature keep the rot at bay. Hopefully, I will have a few left by 29 March, when we are scheduled to leave the EU. At present the UK imports 25% of its potatoes and the crop features regularly in Brexit “to worry about” lists.

Our family’s desire to have our own supply of vegetables, eggs, cheese and milk and to make sure our children know how to store them has felt a little less of a romantic folly as the past two years have unfolded. Every month we spot another sign that society has been busy shrugging off skills only to realise we needed them after all.

“The hungry gap” is one phrase that has fallen out of common use too quickly despite the gap between those who have enough to eat and those who don’t widening in recent years. I learned it while reading John Seymour’s 1961 self-sufficiency classic, The Fat of the Land. The gap begins at the moment each year when winter stores have run low, before spring crops are ready; its length is dependent on the success of harvests and spring weather. Our ancestors would have planned around it and sometimes suffered through it. With supermarkets and imported food (which our family still relies on), we have swiftly forgotten about it, but we might need the hungry gap in our consciousness once again as it coincides so exactly with Britain’s planned EU exit.

Emma Baylis keeps an allotment with 20 chickens in Warwickshire and works as a barber. Chatting to a broad cross-section of her community is part of her job and she is concerned that we have become too complacent and disconnected from our food supply. “I don’t think the majority of people even think of where food comes from,” she says. Baylis is considering whether to kill some of her surplus poultry for meat for the first time; our family is having similar discussions. It’s a battle between how fond we are of the animals and a growing sense that we should only eat meat that we can be certain has a high-welfare provenance. We talked with the children and came to a compromise that we won’t eat the geese or ducks, but will breed from them next year to supply our own freezer. Five young cockerels’ fates still hangs in the balance. I’m hoping this Brexit jumble is worked out before their meat starts to toughen.

In 2016 the gardening writer and broadcaster Monty Don poured scorn on the middle England pursuit of self-sufficiency, stating it is “inevitably doomed to humiliating failure” and is a path towards madness. He’s probably right. For most of us, true self-sufficiency is impossible and unnecessary. I cannot grow enough food for my family without it being a full-time job. Even then there would likely be periods of the year when we would be hungry or have only increasingly shrivelled turnips to eat. Should a Brexit disaster interrupt our national food supply or drive the electricity prices into orbit, we might have, at best, a week’s advantage on everyone else – probably less, now I have talked about our potato store in a national newspaper.

Yet I also agree with Don that seeking to provide some of your own food and energy – what he calls “self-provision” – is pleasurable and worthwhile. After all, there doesn’t have to be a survival motivation to growing. The quality of produce, the chance to eat something that has ripened on the tree, bush or vine, or to watch your children shell and gobble peas like Maltesers is enough. Being outside and feeling the impact of the change of seasons, noticing the first day you break the ice on the animals’ water buckets or seeing the shimmering haze of spring on the cobnut trees connects me to the world and acts as a shield against the anxieties of modern life.

Underneath that, though, I believe that many of us who share a love for growing our own food are undertaking a less extreme version of “prepping”. We might not have nuclear bunkers or 10 years’ worth of canned goods, but we are driven by a human need to know we can rely on our own means and pass this to our children – which is made sharper in times of crisis. I suspect and hope I will never need to radically scale up production of food from my garden and animal sheds, but I will know how to if the time comes.

More than that, in the face of uncertainty and turmoil, I feel, perhaps irrationally, more powerful when I bite into an apple, crack an egg or roast a parsnip that I planned, worked for and harvested. Sometimes we all need to feel a little powerful, just for a moment, in this very confusing world.","With the stability of the food supply chain in question at the time of Brexit, our new skills could come into their own if I do my gardening due diligence.
The renewed interest in grow-your-own and self-sufficiency can be seen in the vast array of books and products for aspiring home producers.
Perhaps it’s not surprising that we’re far from the only idealists whose dreams of self-sufficiency are mingled with political concerns.
At present the UK imports 25% of its potatoes and the crop features regularly in Brexit “to worry about” lists.

2018 ended on a disturbing note in the Azov Sea with a de facto blockade by Russia and what amounted to an act of Russian state-sanctioned piracy against Ukrainian shipping. No one can tell what this crisis means for next year. Will this aggression be confined to limited Russian objectives in and around the Azov Sea? Does it signal a new effort to destabilize Ukraine as a whole during its election year? Or does it augur something bad for Russia’s other neighbors as well? Maybe the men in the Kremlin don’t know themselves.

But it’s worth taking a step back, separating news from longer-term trends, and doing a quick audit of Russia’s capabilities and ambitions in its neighborhood vis-à-vis those of the other states. That is hard to do for Ukrainians, whose compatriots are still dying on the front line in the east of the country. Other post-Soviet states, however, should be capable of more cool reflection.

Consider the South Caucasus. While updating the new edition of my book, The Caucasus: An Introduction, with a new chapter after almost a decade, one theme stood out: the legacy of the Soviet Union is gradually leaving the region, along with the influence of Russia. Russian language use is declining (two thirds of Azerbaijanis now report only basic knowledge of the language). Russian television viewership has declined precipitately. Ethnic Russians comprise no more than two or three percent of the population of the three countries.

Russia itself is still the most powerful neighbor for Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, but increasingly it is one of many. Journalists should stop calling these countries “Russia’s neighborhood,” let alone its “backyard.” The South Caucasus is a region of its own. If it is a neighborhood, it is simultaneously many at once: not just Russia’s, but that of the European Union’s and (once again) Iran’s and Turkey’s. The United States is there—an international consortium, including two U.S. companies, has begun building a deep-water port at Anaklia on Georgia’s Black Sea coast. And China, which sees the region as a transit route for the Belt and Road Initiative, is now a major trading partner.

Russia still has a military base in Armenia. Also, in defiance of international law, it keeps around 7,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Those two places are the exception to the rule. Semi-detached by conflict in 1992-3, they were wrenched even further from Georgia by the war of 2008, which displaced a further 15,000 Georgians from their homes in South Ossetia. Their isolation from Tbilisi has grown. In the last year, most crossing points have closed on the Enguri River border with Abkhazia. The Russians and South Ossetians have provocatively moved the boundary fence in South Ossetia several times into Georgian-controlled territory, by a few meters at a time.

Russian domination of these two territories comes at a cost however. Although they tend to say so quietly, many young Georgians are less than keen at the idea of reintegration with the two breakaway regions. As they are de facto lost, the upside is that Georgia’s economic integration with the EU and military partnership with the United States can proceed more quickly. Protracted conflicts can no longer be an excuse—at home or in the West—for making domestic progress.

Armenia is an even more striking example. A close military and politically ally of Russia, financially reliant on Moscow for its energy and infrastructure, it nonetheless managed to cast off its old regime in 2018. Many Western observers were surprised that Russia did not intervene in the “Velvet Revolution” to save a friendly regime, but it actually had very few levers to do so. On December 9 the leader of the revolution, Nikol Pashinyan, completed the last stage of his spectacular victory with a landslide win in the country’s parliamentary election. The election signaled, amongst other things, a rejection of close alignment with Russia. One of the two opposition parties that made it into parliament, Bright Armenia, even calls itself pro-European.



Pashinyan is not exactly anti-Russian—or, rather, is so only by implication as he talks about European values and democracy. The point is that, aged 43, he is without the Soviet background of his predecessors. To quote one Armenian analyst, he is of a generation that is not so much Soviet, anti-Soviet, or post-Soviet, but simply un-Soviet. Georgia’s prime minister, Mamuka Bakhtadze, who is just 36, falls into the same category.

The developing “post-Russian” identity in the South Caucasus is not much consolation to Ukraine, which remains uniquely vulnerable to Russia, even as it struggles with its own new identity formation.

What it shows is that each of the three South Caucasian countries has found a way to manage its relationship with Russia. If their leaders themselves do nothing stupid to alienate their own populations and do not go to war with each other (take note, Armenia and Azerbaijan), they stand a good chance of navigating 2019 without a confrontation with Russia. Where the Kremlin stands a better chance of manipulating things, if it chooses to do so, it is by exploiting the corruption of elites to maintain influence.

These trends do not make the radar of the Russian propaganda machine. They are perfectly acceptable for the more pragmatic Russian constituencies, such as the business community, working in the region—or indeed the tens of thousands of Russian tourists who visit each year.

It is a slow process, but we see three countries which, for all their flaws, have become functioning states and more or less autonomous international actors. They are a long way from being Switzerland, but they are a million miles from the poor, conflict-torn places they all were in the 1990s. Domestic woes such as corruption, poverty, and emigration are the most serious issues. These, at least, are problems that the governments have the power to fix themselves and which the public can hold them to account for. Happy New Year!","Thomas de Waal De Waal is a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe, specializing in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region.

• The Northern Region received normal to above while the Centre and South receive below normal rainfall.

• The Centre and South experienced prolonged dry spells averaging 2-4 weeks while the North experienced minimal dry spells in isolated places.

• Fall army worms infestations were reported in all districts but unlike last year control measures were spontaneous this season thus minimising impact.

• Maize production has dropped from 3.5million MT to 2.7 million MT representing 28%.

• MVAC projects that maize prices will continue to rise from December 2018 to March 2019, but trending slightly above the fiveyear average.

• The 2018 VAA forecast projected that 3.3 people will require assistance from 2 to 4 months.

• SMART survey results of February 2018 have shown overall nutritional status of under-five children was within acceptable ranges per WHO global thresholds (prevalence <5%)

1. Context and Background

Malawi’s economic growth outlook for 2018 has been weakened mainly due to the impact of dry spells, Fall Armyworm (FAW) and intermittent power supply. Real GDP is projected to be around 4.03 % in 2018; (down from 5.1% in 2017) 4.65 % in 2019; and 4.8 % in 2020. Poverty still remains a fundamental issue: about 51.54 % of the population leave below the national poverty line and 20.1 % being ultra-poor.

The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) projects annual average inflation for 2018 at around 9.0%. Despite the recent reduction in inflation, the RBM hints that risks to inflation outlook persist largely due to rising global oil market prices. The recent increase in fuel prices is likely to have a significant impact on the pricing of goods and services in general, food prices in particular. The official exchange rate continues to be stable, trading at around K726 (middle rate) against the United States dollar since November, 2016.

After two consecutive bad production years, last year’s harvest saw a much-needed return to normalcy (3.5 million tones of maize produced). However, the 2018 maize production is estimated to drop (by 22%) to 2.7 million tones, largely due to prolonged dry spells and fall army worm infestation.

According to the FEWSNET July18 Outlook Report, national maize carryover stocks are estimated at around 200,000 MT (ADMARC, SGR). National average maize prices have remained depressed since 2017 but are likely to start increasing from July to October, 2018 but projected to trend below the five year average. From November 2018, prices will experience significant increases and trend above the five-year average.

Seasonal forecast for the 2018/2019 production season is so far pointing towards an El Nino phenomenon associated with below average rainfall for the Southern Africa Region.

Ramona Martinez’s dog, Sadie, is “more than my companion.”

“I don’t have anything else,” another woman says of her 4-month-old Doberman.

The women are homeless; they look to their pets for affection and stability. Until recently, most pet owners hoping to get under a roof had to make a choice: give up your companion or stay on the street. But the need to get a growing number of homeless into shelters has nonprofits and agencies softening their “no pets” attitude.

At the start of the decade, very few homeless shelters in the United States welcomed dogs and cats along with their human caregivers. Today, in Orange County alone, three shelters – including The Link opened by Santa Ana in November – allow clients to keep pets with them. Two emergency shelters Anaheim is opening in early 2019 also will offer pet crates and dog runs.

While there’s little hard data available, “We’re definitely hearing that it’s becoming a more widespread practice,” National Alliance to End Homelessness CEO Nan Roman said.

What changed?

It may be part of a larger shift away from a paternalistic attitude to one of compassion for homeless people, experts said.

“Rather than this kind of judgmental approach where we give you a basic option and you should be grateful for it,” Eric Tars, legal director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, said, “If we want people to come in off the streets, we actually need to make shelter an attractive and accessible option for them.”

No pets allowed

Rules forbidding pets may have arisen from concerns about animals biting people, triggering allergies or making a mess, or because of a lack of space and resources to help human clients, experts said.

But for those on the street, particularly single women, a dog can mean security. A pet may also represent an important and longstanding relationship.

“Pets are often the only companion that people carry with them from their housed life into their homeless life,” Tars said.

In recent years, some who serve the homeless have realized barring companion animals can undermine their efforts to get people off the streets. The Nevada-based nonprofit Pets of the Homeless, which distributes donated pet food and helps with veterinary care, estimates 5 percent to 10 percent of homeless people have cats or dogs.

Being forced to decide between their best friend and a warm bed puts people in a bind, said CityNet Vice President Matt Bates, who has worked in homeless services in Southern California since 1994.

In Bates’s experience, “Almost always, they chose to stay with their pets rather than surrender their pets, even if we could arrange a foster situation.”

In Riverside, City Councilman Mike Gardner decided to find a solution so people would take the offered shelter.

He helped secure donations and grants for a kennel building that houses dog and cat cages next door to the city’s emergency shelter. Pet owners sign liability waivers and are responsible for feeding and cleaning up after their animals, which must be licensed and vaccinated.

The Riverside kennel opened in 2011 – as far as Gardner knows, it was the third one in the country, which includes a shelter in Los Angeles – and it’s “still pretty heavily used,” he said. Shelter clients keep pets there overnight and when they go to jobs during the day.

Fears unfounded?

Now that they’ve tried it, some groups that help the homeless have realized including pets isn’t hard.

Other than the up-front expense of installing a dog run or kennel, there’s no significant cost difference in accommodating pets, although donations of pet food and supplies are always a help, said Paul Leon, CEO of Illumination Foundation, which operates several Orange County shelters.

A nonprofit mobile service provides pet health care.

Larry Haynes, executive director of Orange County-based shelter operator Mercy House, said he was initially worried about allowing animals at the county-owned Bridges at Kraemer Place.

“I was wrong,” he said. “It really hasn’t been that difficult an issue. In fact, what we’ve found is the pets have been a calming presence for a lot of folks.”

That’s true for Jackie Anderson, 64, who’s been homeless for three years and staying at Bridges for about six months with her 2-year-old cat.

Dodger (Anderson is a baseball fan) is a playful gray and white shorthaired male who Anderson found in a box in the trash.

“Somebody threw him away, I guess,” she said. “I fell in love with him.”

Anderson nursed Dodger back to health after a coyote attack, and now she’d never leave him, even if it meant living outdoors, she said.

In some communities, finding shelter for people with pets is still a challenge.

“We’ve had people call us weekly asking, ‘I’m going to be homeless tomorrow, where can I go,’” said Genevieve Frederick, who founded Pets of the Homeless.

All the group can do is find out where the caller is and check lists to see if there’s an accommodating shelter in the area, she said.

But Tars, of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, noted the spread of a “housing first” philosophy – get people into a stable living situation, then work on their other problems – and a recent federal court decision that cities can’t ban sleeping in public.

Those factors may lead to greater acceptance of “the three P’s” that can be barriers to the homeless accepting help: pets, partners and possessions, he said.

When it comes to companion animals, Bates, the outreach worker, said the mental health and emotional benefits to homeless people outweigh any inconvenience of allowing animals in shelters.

“Maybe our opinion has changed that this is not a luxury item for a lot of people. For many people, it’s an essential component to their well-being on the street.”","The Healthcare & Emergency Animal Rescue Team (HEART) provides animal care to pet owners that are homeless.

Saturday, December 15, 2018 (PW) — Each of us was born with nothing on hand at the time of birth. This fact needs no one to be reminded about. On equal measure some of us go on not to gain much out of this world in the way of riches.

Nature has adequately endowed my country, South Sudan with natural resources that could make everyone in the country to be adequately catered for but this is not the case. We have abundance of livestock, vegetation, fish and recently oil wealth.

Despite abundance of the above natural wealth and the low population people remained extremely poor compared to neighbouring countries. Some of the reasons why people remained poor include; war, tribal or internal conflicts and lack of general productivity by organisations and individuals alike.

War alone has the greatest potential to imposed displacement and destitution on the country. The 1983-2005 and the 2013 – 2018 upheavals are the best examples for South Sudan.

Over the recent months, South Sudan have prominently featured on the world stage for the unlikely show of riches with tradition in the mix. The marriage of Nyanlong and the Lual Malong Yor Jr. shows, both on the Facebook otherwise collectively known as social media.

Lual Malong Yor Jr. who have been on social media for years with his show of wealth went on record to deny has alleged linage to former army chief turned rebel leader, General Paul Malong Awan. He denied being his son on The Citizen TV before Jeff Koinange in Nairobi, Kenya. On the last week of November, the same Lual Malong went to Kampala Uganda and was arrested for reasons best known to authorities there. This author is not sure whether he was released or still behind bars as we speak.

One thing is certain for Lual Malong ordeals – show of wealth. A lot of wealthy people around the world won’t go on the internet to attract attention for the sake of wealth. These people allow others to report it and they have the luxury to deny those reports to the contrary. These people like Bill Gates of USA have a legitimate and verifiable source to where they obtained those riches.

When pressed to disclose the source of his wealth, Lual was not forth coming. the fact that he was alleged to be related to Paul Malong was an attempt to dig the source of his boasted riches. There is nothing wrong with being in possession of riches at any one time as long as those riches have been legitimately and legally obtained. And depending on intended use, riches can be a blessing to both the owner and the less fortunate.

In a country like South Sudan where great majority wallows in poverty there is an increased demand on those with wealth to be responsible and live to the expectations in the country and abroad.

Moving into 2019, there is reason to celebrate. Latest estimates by World Data Lab show that, for the first time in history, the world will enter the new year with the lowest level of extreme poverty, at 8%. But single digit numbers hide underlying differences, especially for African countries. 600 million people globally will start 2019 living in extreme poverty and only 20 million will come out of this situation by the end of the year.

Africa still has much of its population living in poverty or vulnerable. Projections from the ECA’s recently unveiled Africa Poverty Clock estimate that, in 2019, 70% of the world’s poor will live in Africa, up from 50% in 2015. By 2023, the share of Africa’s poor will increase to over 80% of global share. In other words, Africa will be adding more poor people to the world. The African Poverty Clock provides real-time poverty estimates for every country on the continent, with forecasts until 2030. Current projections indicate that almost all of Africa is off track for ending extreme poverty by 2030. Thirteen countries are projected to see an increase in absolute numbers. Seven out of the top ten countries in the world with the most poor people are in Africa. This is expected to rise to nine out of ten by 2030. Four main factors drive Africa’s diverging progress with the rest of the world.

The poor in Africa start further below the poverty line than those in other global regions. So even if incomes rise, it is rarely enough to push a significant proportion out of poverty. Africa’s poverty gap index, which is a measure of the intensity or depth of poverty, is nearly double the global average at 15.2 per cent in 2013 (global averages is 8.8 per cent). The average consumption of the poor across the East, Southern, West and Central regions is $1.16 a day, which is $0.74 below the international poverty line, thus posing a challenge to achieving the SDGs target of eliminating poverty by 2030.

Poverty reduction is further impacted by high inequality levels. When inequality levels are high, economic growth delivers less impact for poverty. Across many countries in Africa, the richest 20% controls up to 60% of the wealth, as a consequence, growth has not been inclusive. Africa’s inequality landscape is also characterised by high average inequality, extreme inequality (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana) and a bifurcation of inequality trends that sees substantial variations in ‘within-country’ trends.

The mismatch between sectors of growth and employment remains a challenge. Agriculture continues to be an important contributor to economic growth and the transition to industry remains slow. In Burundi, Burkina Faso, and Madagascar, more than 80 percent of the labour force works in agriculture. Africa’s manufacturing sector employed only 9% of women and 16% of men on average over the decade. However, most of Africa’s working poor are predominantly found in the informal sector characterised by low productivity and low incomes. Despite the increase in employment within the services sector, the reality is that people are moving from low productivity agriculture to similar low productivity urban informal activities thus there is little impact on rising incomes.

The economic growth recorded for the last 20 years has made minimal impact due to rapid population growth. With 2.6% population growth rate, on average, is accounted for, annual per capita growth in the last quarter century comes in at just 1.1%, which is insufficient to reduce poverty quickly. However, it is important to note that the rate of population growth witnessed over the last two decades is unlikely to repeat itself in the coming decades, thus presenting unique opportunities for countries to make significant impact on poverty reduction.

Nonetheless, 2019 may prove a significant turning point in Africa’s progress towards the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030. For the first time, in 2019, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty in Africa will be reduced. But there is no guarantee that this pace will continuein the absence of the right public policies and actions. Sustained economic growth of the magnitude of at least 8-10% is necessary for the quantum leap needed for faster poverty reduction and to achieve the SDGs.

Africa’s focus on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), digital economy and the scaled up push for gender inclusion bode well for inclusive growth over the next decade if governments adopt adequate fiscal and structural policies to crown in the private sector and improve infrastructure.

Vera Songwe is Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA","600 million people globally will start 2019 living in extreme poverty and only 20 million will come out of this situation by the end of the year.

Share this:

Congressman Gregory Meeks does not support forming a Select Committee For A Green New Deal because he doesn’t think it is the right political strategy.

The congressman said he did not support the formation of a new committee on Friday, Dec. 14 during a lengthy meeting with concerned Queens constituents and local activists, who met to discuss the proposal.

Rockaway Revolution, Rockaway Women for Progress, Rockaway Beach Civic Association and Belle Harbor Property Owners were some of the organisations represented at Meeks’ Arverne office.

The draft proposal, pioneered by Queens Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, entails moving to 100 percent renewable energy and going carbon neutral within 10 years. This would, in theory, create a myriad of renewable job training opportunities in underserved communities like Rockaway, as well as promoting economic and environmental justice and equality.

As part of the GND, a Select Committee of 15 representatives would be appointed by the House speaker (six of whom may be appointed on the recommendation of the Minority Leader) to develop a “detailed, national, industrial, economic mobilization plan.”

According to the proposal, this plan will be completed by Jan. 1, 2020 and the draft legislation will be finalized no later than March 1, 2020. This Select Committee would examine the emerging issues “that don’t fit clearly within existing standing committee jurisdictions or cut across jurisdictional boundaries.”

Although Meeks promised to keep an “open mind” next year, he said he wouldn’t support the formation of the GND committee right now because it would do “more harm than good for the purpose of drafting or advancing any legislation.”

Instead, Meeks is supporting Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s call to reinstate her committee addressing climate change through renewable energy which, he told attendees last Friday, isn’t “far off” their Green New Deal ideas.

“I support the core tenets of the Green New Deal, but not the strategy to implement it,” Meeks told The Wave on Wednesday, Dec. 19. “That is why I support the OFF Fossil Fuels Act to be on 100 percent renewable energy, and the percent infrastructure component of a Better Deal which would be the largest jobs initiative since the New Deal.”

Meeks said the aforementioned are “concrete bills” that were drafted and sent to their respective committees of jurisdiction.

“A separate legislative committee, as theorized by the GND, is not ideal for passing through legislation that will require the capacity and know-how of several committees working on all the various components of a bill of this size,” said Meeks. “The renewable energy portion should go through Energy & Commerce, the jobs component through Education & the Workforce, etc.”

Despite the Meeks’ misgivings, 40 members of Congress have already given their support as of Thursday, Dec. 19. Senator Ed Markey, who was the Co-Chair of The Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming from 2007 to 2010, has also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s Select Committee. Meeks pointed out that it takes 218 members of congress to sign on in order for the GND “to pass the floor,” however.

Nevertheless, over 300 local and state government officials from 40 states have signed an open letter supporting Ocasio-Cortez’s initiative. The letter, entitled ‘Empowering lawmakers to act boldly on climate,’ stated that “[d]ecades of denial, misinformation, and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry has delayed critical action to transition our society from its current dependence on fossil fuels.”

Kate Walls and Marva Schomburg Kerwin of Rockaway Revolution, a grassroots organization addressing racism, political transparency, and environmental sustainability, said the GND would guide the legislative process and provide a “comprehensive vision for the future.” Walls added that “reviving [Pelosi’s] committee is not sufficient for the scope of the threat that we currently face,” considering there were over 80 public hearings over 3.5 years and little action.

“We need to take huge change to our economic structure that our country really hasn’t done since WWII,” Walls told the Congressman. “We need to facilitate that change quickly so that Rockaway and the rest of NY-05 is not underwater or on fire.”

However, Walls and Schomburg Kerwin left the meeting feeling “frustrated” by the congressman’s stance.

“The old committee cannot act on these issues like ending mass poverty and creating a federal jobs guarantee—it literally is not within their scope of action,” Walls told The Wave. “Meeks is saying, ‘trust us- we will come up with something.’ But he couldn’t guarantee what parts, if any, of the GND will be in that new strategy, or what that strategy would be.

“The Free from Fossil Fuel Act is only focused on tax accreditation to polluters who switch to entirely renewable energy sources,” Walls continued, adding that democrats should have had a plan ready to go for when they regained legislative power.

“Ocasio-Cortez hasn’t been sworn in yet and she’s had this plan with measurable goals and specific guidelines for months,” she added.

“It’s unclear to us why the Congressman wouldn’t support a Select Committee for a GND if he is in support of these initiatives,” agreed Schomburg Kerwin. “The Congressman doesn’t agree on the GND strategy and that’s the only detail I walked away with. Quite frankly, I think Congressman Meeks’ lack of support for the GND speaks for itself.”

Likewise, Bright Dae-Jung Limm, a Queens constituent who attended the meeting, left feeling that Meeks was more focused on “strategizing” than implementing any concrete change.

“Right now he’s focused on acquiring leverage,” Limm told The Wave. “[W]e’re focused on increasing the chances that Congress as a body will take seriously the need to create a sustainable environment, millions of jobs, new infrastructure, and racial justice.”

Another attendee Jean Belford, the President of Rockaway Women for Progress, also urged Meeks to support the GND Select Committee because it’s an “important moment in time to be bold and look climate change in the face with a comprehensive, transformative plan.”

“[The GND] not only addresses our environment but also offers a complete job program to local communities,” Belford told The Wave. “There is a Democratic Congressional retreat [next year] and, instead of talking about the pros and cons of a Green New Deal, we believe this time would be much better served if it is used not to debate the efficacy of the Green New Deal but instead get to work on it.”

The Arverne meeting comes after the Sunrise Movement’s protest at Pelosi’s Capitol Hill office last week, where students demanded swift action for climate change. The young people involved are focused on making climate change an “urgent priority” across America.

On Dec. 16, Varshini Prakash, a spokesperson for Sunrise Movement, confirmed that Congressman Mark Takano of the CA 41st District was the 38th member of congress to sign on to the Green New Deal.

“To give our generation a livable future and save millions of lives from the devastation of climate change, we need massive government action, not just a continuation of the half-measure that got us into this crisis,” Prakash told The Wave.

“The proposals that Rep. Meeks and other Democratic leaders point to when criticizing the Green New Deal are simply not in line with what the latest science demands. The UN says we have 12 years to move off fossil fuels. New polling shows that the Green New Deal has majority support among both parties, including 92 percent of Democrats.”

Congresswoman Nydia M. Velázquez, who serves CD 7 and signed on to the GND, told The Wave that a new modus operandi was necessary at this point.

“While certainly the existing Committees of jurisdiction will continue to play a central role, climate change is such an existential threat to our planet that our new Democratic Majority should take a new approach in addressing this crisis,” Velázquez said. “What we can all agree on is that inaction simply is not an option.”","Congressman declines to sign onto Green New DealShare this:Congressman Gregory Meeks does not support forming a Select Committee For A Green New Deal because he doesn’t think it is the right political strategy.

240,https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-working-class_uk_5c00f22ce4b063e4453e9bb1,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",HuffPost UK,Why Is No One Asking How Brexit Will Help The Working Class?,"On 23 June, I wrote a Facebook post that said:

“A states sovereignty is not undermined or tarnished through its affiliation with an international organisation. It is rather enhanced because the state stands with its vetoing/decision making abilities whilst part of the organisation. Britain being, in this case, the longest standing stable sovereign nation in all of western Europe. I’m not a rocket scientist but enhancing accomplishments seems like a better option than heading into social and economic domestic uncertainty. That will be an example of a sovereign making a bad choice, no? Vote wisely.”

The post was ambiguous and void of persuasion for a particular vote. The aim of the post was to emphasis that during the campaigns discussions on the socio-economic impact of Brexit were only (and still has only been) about immigration, if not a scaremongering tactic.

The impact of Brexit on the working class have been totally disregarded in the Brexit equation. For most part this seems fair given that in the initial stages of implementations after 29th March 2019 we will see a hard hit for the middle classes. Yet as the prices of common goods and some services begin to rise we might also witness striking changes to our poverty lines. I refer to poverty in a relative sense.

Following the noise and upheavals from parliament over the past few weeks with MPs resigning, it would seem that the focus for the past two years on the Brexit matter has been largely focused on a strict middle-class dialogue, that which involved tory politicians travelling to Brussels deliberating on deals for businesses. The Prime Ministers creation of five Business Councils to provide advice for conditions of businesses after Brexit proves this. However, after last week there were little reminders of austerity and consideration of poverty.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur for Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, on his visit to the U.K. said “the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society will take the biggest hit from Brexit” this of course is because people fear that their homes, jobs and communities are at risk, and rightly so they are.

The Archbishop of Canterbury also expressed that prayers were needed for ‘the most vulnerable in our society, whose lives will be shaped for better or worse’ by the Brexit negotiations. In true British fashion nonchalance to take the drivers seat while fingers point at the Prime Minister, and now we are faced with cabinet secretaries taking and leaving roles as though cowardice is en vogue.

Today, to our detriment, it seems a light bulb has switched and pertinent domestic issues, such as austerity and poverty have now risen to the surface. All issues that have social and economic implications for the working-class. By referring to ‘the working-class’ they can be defined according to the 21st Century Seven Social classes in the U.K. classified as ‘Emergent Service Workers’ and the ‘Traditional Working Class’.

Socially, as kids in public schools in the U.K. grow up without a sense of recognition of Europe in their everyday lives. Be it the lack of motivation of learning European languages or a failure in understanding the low livelihoods of other European countries through migration, all which harmless things the E.U. has afforded to the working-class.

Economically, the disadvantages existing before may also continue to exist, if not deteriorate. The emphasis here is placed on this strict dialogue that surrounds London and Brussels where the ‘top-dogs’ speak while towns beyond the capitals of Wales and Scotland bask in destitution given their heavy reliance on the E.U. funding.

There is no doubt that conversations surrounding Brexit have been made out to seem enormously technical. This has gone to the extent that one would think leaving the E.U. was a private conversation between ministers and civil servants in Westminster and their likes in Europe. Of course, there is some truth in claiming that Brexit excludes the working class opinion.

Of course, this goes without acknowledging the fact that some working-class individuals did vote to leave. Yet, it seems in these negotiations the ‘breakthroughs’ promised to working class voters were merely tactics used to wheel in support. I do not imply that somehow working-class voters do not have a voice in Britain or are handicapped in their ability to process politics. I merely point out that the most attractive aspects of the leave campaign for working-class people was presented in an apocalyptic manner. This makes it seem like they were used as easy prey in achieving a goal, further than that they have been dumped and their needs forgotten. Today it seems conversations around Brexit completely excludes talks about money for the NHS or more jobs.

It is an established fact that many people in the U.K. live in poverty. This is not a hidden fact anymore. But it seems nobody is interested in questioning how leaving the EU will impact drug dealers in Dundee, the homeless on the streets of Yorkshire or unemployed graduates from working class homes. So I ask what will Brexit mean for the working class besides getting poorer?​","The impact of Brexit on the working class have been totally disregarded in the Brexit equation.

(Wikimedia Commons)

Clad in oversized goggles, with grotesque face coverings under otherworldly gasmasks, soldiers in the trenches of the First World War seemed fully mechanized, fully dehumanized, in their attempt to survive the world's first employment of chemical warfare on a large scale. The industrial revolution, and the technology that it ushered in, had finally been turned from their original home in industry, to the art of war itself.

You can see the fear-inspiring uniforms the soldiers wore, along with life-size images of men in them, at the National World War I Memorial and Museum, just a few miles from NCR's headquarters in Kansas City. In this year, the centennial anniversary of the war's end, that old technology serves as a ghastly reminder of the ways in which warfare evolved in the 20th century. While World War I changed what war itself could be, it also began a change in how the church, both leadership and laity, thought about war, the United States, and Catholics' role in both. In Rome, Pope Benedict XV, who reigned from September of 1914 until his death in early 1922, pled the cause of peace, issuing an encyclical decrying war in November and calling for a Christmas truce in December. As the conflict raged on, he continued calling for an end to hostilities and even presented a plan to end the war, although his pronouncements were largely disregarded by the belligerents. In the U.S., which stayed out of the European conflict until April of 1917, the bishops pledged the support of American Catholics for the war effort as soon as it was underway. ""Moved to the very depths of our hearts by the stirring appeal of the President of the United States, and by the action of our national Congress, we accept whole-heartedly and unreservedly the decree of that legislative authority proclaiming this country to be in a state of war,"" the bishops wrote to President Woodrow Wilson after the declaration of war.

Although the U.S. reaction to the war undermined the papal position at the time, it was hardly unique. ""French Catholics saw the war as a chance to unite France; German Catholics (persecuted by the state in the 19th century) participated wholeheartedly,"" historian and former dean of the University of Notre Dame College of Arts and Letters John T. McGreevy told NCR. ""And the same was true for Italian, Belgian Catholics etc. This all made it challenging for the Vatican to manage tensions, especially when Benedict XV offered his own peace plan, and was then challenged by the peace plan offered by Woodrow Wilson."" While many American Catholics shared their bishops' sentiments and served in the war wholeheartedly, some did not. One example was Denver resident Ben Salmon, who refused to go to Europe after being drafted in 1917. Despite the pronouncements of the leadership of his church, Salmon cited his religious convictions in a letter to the president, stating, ""The commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' is unconditional and inexorable … When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army."" At the time, it seemed that there may be ""no space for someone like Ben Salmon in the Catholic Church,"" Marie Dennis, co-president of Pax Christi International told NCR. ""While in other traditions … there was an agreed upon root for a conscientious objector. That simply didn't exist in the Catholic Church.""

Marie Dennis UN c_0.jpg Marie Dennis, then-co-president of Pax Christi International, speaks at an event at the United Nations in 2017 (NCR photo/Chris Herlinger)

The church had long relied on the Just War Theory to determine the morality of participation in such conflict, ""which had been useful but didn't stretch the thinking very much beyond that, which was very notable in the United States,"" Dennis added. Salmon was sentenced to death for his refusal to participate in the war, but found support for his position among some parts of the church, including Msgr. John Ryan, a moral theologian at the Catholic University of America, who rallied to his defense. Salmon's sentence was ultimately commuted, and he was released in 1920. While the bishops' letter seems to depart from the condemnation of war that might be more common among Christians today, it is worth noting that, at the time, many Catholics living the country were immigrants, and sometimes suspected of harboring their true loyalty to the pope, and not their country. ""The U.S. church was not considered part of the U.S. political mainstream,"" Dennis said, and the bishops may have viewed their letter as ""an opportunity to raise the status of Catholics in the United States."" In this sense, the war was a new beginning for Catholics in the U.S. The bishops' tone in approaching war would show clear signs of evolution in subsequent decades. In 1983, the bishops conference released a pastoral titled ""The Challenge of Peace,"" in which they acknowledged the long tradition of pacifism in Christianity, saying that ""The vision of Christian non-violence is not passive about injustice and the defense of the rights of others; it rather affirms and exemplifies what it means to resist injustice through non-violent methods.""

Vladimir Putin takes a dip in freezing temperatures

Russian President Vladimir Putin stripped off to his bathing trunks and immersed himself in the freezing waters of a lake in January, observing an Orthodox Christian ritual to mark the feast of Epiphany.

Russian state television showed Putin marching onto the ice of frozen Lake Seliger, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of Moscow, dressed in a sheepskin coat and felt boots.

With his coat and boots removed, he then walked down a set of wooden steps into a hole in the ice, crossed himself, and dipped his head under the water before surfacing.

Air temperatures at the time were around -6°C.

Each year at Epiphany, Orthodox believers immerse themselves in rivers and lakes to commemorate the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan.

As president, he has become a frequent attendee of Russian Orthodox ceremonies and has given the church a major voice in society.

Tuna tossing in Australia

In Australia, spectacular tosses were on display at the Tuna Tossing World Championships.

Tourists and locals launched rubber fish over long distances to compete for a 1,000 AUD cash (€628) prize.

The horrors of the war in Syria

Earlier this year, people in the Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta were bombarded for days in attacks that left many observers speechless.

Rather than describing the scene, we want you to be able to see it for yourself. The video shows the reality of modern war. The scenes are violent and disturbing.

'US Embassy' road signs in Jerusalem

At least three road signs reading ""US Embassy"" went up in Jerusalem after US President Donald Trump controversially recognised the city as Israel's capital.

Trump announced the move in December 2017, saying he was making good on US legislation and presidential pledges, dating back decades, to support Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital.

Legoland in the UK unveils miniature royal wedding scene

Legoland Windsor unveiled a new miniature creation of Windsor Castle, complete with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in wedding attire, to celebrate the couple's marriage.

Built especially for the occasion, the replica Windsor Castle is made up of 39,960 Lego bricks.

Despite being situated just three miles (five kilometres) from the real castle, it's the first time Windsor Castle has been added to the resort's Miniland attraction.

The whole scene took 11 model makers 752 hours to build and is made up of almost 60,000 Lego bricks.

Achilles the World Cup predicting cat

Achilles, a white-haired, deaf cat was designated as the official World Cup 2018 forecaster.

Like Paul the Octopus before the 2010 World Cup, Achilles 'predicted' the winners of matches by choosing between two boxes containing food.

""We chose Achilles because he is handsome, but also because he is deaf like all blue-eyed white cats,"" said Anna Kondratieva, a veterinarian at the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.

""He sees with his heart,"" she added.

Colachos jump over Spanish babies to bring them good luck

Men representing the devil, known as Colachos, leapt over young babies in an ancient Spanish religious festival designed to chase out bad spirits. El Salto del Colacho or The Jump of the Colacho, takes place every year in the village of Castrillo de Murcia, near Burgos, in northern Spain.

The babies are all under one year of age and the festival is meant to represent the triumph of Christianity over evil.

It has taken place on the feast of Corpus Christi every year since the 1600s.

Trump and Kim impersonators thrill crowd

Donald Trump and Kim Jung Un impersonators became popular after they impersonated the two leaders during the Pyeongchang Olympics. They resurfaced again in Singapore during the US-North Korea Summit, walking around holding hands.

Lion climbs into car full of tourists in Crimea

The footage shows the lion, known as Filya, climbing over tourists and cuddling and licking them in a car at Taigan Safari Park, Crimea.

The incident happened weeks after a woman was hurt by a different lion in the same park.

President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping demonstrated their cooking skills on Tuesday, September 11, after their talks in Russia's eastern city of Vladivostok.

With kitchen aprons on, Putin and Xi fried traditional Russian pancakes — also known as bliny — and tried them with seafood delicacies including red and black caviar.

The leaders were also offered vodka shots which they drank after toasting each other.

Istanbul: A car, motorcycle and plane race against each other

In Turkey, a motorcycle overtook a fighter plane, a commercial plane, an electric car and three sports cars during a test run on the runways of Istanbul's new airport.

On the starting line there was a 605 challenger plane, a Turkish F16, a Tesla PL 1000DL, an Aston Martin, a Lotus Evora, a Redbull Formula 1 and a Kawasaki H2R.

Japanese skipping star breaks another world record

Japanese professional rope skipper Hijiki Ikuyama broke a new Guinness World Record joining others around the globe to celebrate the annual World Records Day.

Egged on by loud cheers from primary school children, Ikuyama, who holds seven Guinness World Records in rope skipping, managed 24 skips in 30 seconds in the more challenging mamba rope release style, beating his previous record of 22 skips.

Ikuyama said the children's support contributed to his success, on a day when the Guinness World Records celebrates the spirit of attempting to break new records with activities across the world.

British artist unveils thousands of shrouded figures for WWI cemetery

A British artist has unveiled an installation composed of more than 70,000 shrouded figures to mark the centenary of the end of World War One.

The ""Shrouds of the Somme"" installation is a collection of 72,396 small figurines laid out in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

Each one represents a British Commonwealth serviceman who was killed at the Somme and has no known grave.

The Battle of the Somme is one of the bloodiest battles in history. The devastating World War One clash began on July 1, 1916, along a 24-kilometre front near the River Somme in northern France, where British and French forces hoped to win a decisive victory against Germany. Around 20,000 British soldiers died on the first day alone. By the end of the battle in November more than one million men had perished and the allies had advanced just 11 kilometres.

Migrants scramble onto a trailer in Mexico en route to Northern border

In November, migrants left Queretaro in central Mexico en masse and headed toward the US after President Donald Trump signed a 90-day ban on migrants crossing through the US southern border.

The order, taken together with a regulation issued by the Trump administration, would effectively prevent migrants who crossed the US border with Mexico illegally from receiving asylum in the United States.

Preferring the uncertainty at the border over the certainty of poverty and crime back home, the migrants continued to head north to take their chances.

Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, was praised for taking the time to clear up his own coffee spill. He was filmed knocking the hot drink over as he went through security barriers at the Dutch parliament.

Or, rather several Gatluaks — the name is common in South Sudan and “all know a Gatluak [who behaves this way]”, Nyaruach says.

With fierce feminist messaging, Nyaruach's playful song reclaims a woman's dignity after getting burned in love. It also reminds the world that vibrant music and art emerge out of Kakuma Refugee Camp in northern Kenya, one of the largest refugee camps in the region.

Nyaruach, a single mother of two who lives in Kakuma, told Global Voices during a Skype interview:

South Sudanese men fail women with the wrong kind of love. So, my message is to the young girls of the new generation … Love is killing the new generation.

The catchy song and music video, which features some of Nyaruach's Kakuma co-residents, released in November 2018, caught the world's attention for its hypnotic Afro-beats and bold lyrics.

“Gatluak” is the second release on the album NAATH (“humans” in Nuer) produced by Nyaruach and her brother Emmanuel Jal, a hip-hop artist who gained notoriety after his autobiography, “War Child: A Child Soldier's Story”, was published in 2009. As children, the siblings were forced apart through extreme circumstances.

The two draw on Nuer traditional folk and love songs and interlace them with addictive dance beats. “We can’t forget our culture”, Nyaruach said. “We have to remind the new generation about the past — and music makes people happy.”

Nyaruach and Jal named the album NAATH after the “glorious Kingdom of Kush” of the Nile as an antidote to images of war and poverty that have characterized South Sudan.

A long road to music

Nyaruach was born in 1983 in Tonj, Sudan and separated from her family at the age of four when her mother died. Her brother Jal was taken as a child by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army and forced to fight. He was then taken to Kenya at the age of 11 with the help of a British aid worker who was married to then-senior SPLA commander Riek Machar. There he discovered hip-hop, which he used to encourage peace.

Nyaruach's life took a different turn. She spent several tumultuous years with relatives and ran away from an abusive father at the age of 10, surviving several arduous escapes from Sudan, first to Ethiopia and later, to Kenya.

South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011, after a 22-year long civil war (1983-2005). The peace did not last long despite major investments in South Sudan's development. In 2013, armed conflict broke out in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. This spread to other areas of the country, gradually turning into an inter-ethnic conflict between the country’s two largest ethnic groups: the Dinka, represented by President Salva Kiir Mayardit, and the Nuer, represented by then-Vice President Riek Machar.

Nyaruach did not reunite with Jal until they met in Nairobi. They collaborated on a song called Gua, or “peace” in the Nuer language. She was 22. The song was a hit in Kenya in 2005 and a breakthrough song for Jal, who went on to become an award-winning musician and peace activist.

Jal also faced criticism for contradicting his role model status with using social media to air divisive views that stoked ethnic tensions when conflict erupted in South Sudan in 2013.

In 2015, Nyaruach traveled to South Sudan for a short visit. Upon her return, she spoke out against the violence she witnessed. Pregnant with her second child, she decided to shift to Kakuma, seeking security.

Kakuma Refugee Camp was originally established by the UNHCR in 1992 to host 20,000 Sudanese children and youth known later as the “Lost Boys of Sudan” fleeing violence during the Second Sudanese Civil War.

Today, over 56 percent of the population of Kakuma and neighboring Kalobeyei settlement are from South Sudan. At the end of January 2018, the camps hosted a total of 185,449 registered refugees and asylum-seekers.

Nyaruach said that living in a refugee camp is especially hard on women with children.

They give us firewood for a month, it finishes after seven days. We need to eat our meal, we wake up at 4 a.m. to steal. Yes, we have to steal it — and it's very dangerous. They rape us, they can even shoot and kill us. But we can't report. Who is going to report? We have no voice or authority.

Enduring years of hardship has taken at toll on Nyaruach's spirit. Reuniting and making music with Jal has felt like salvation. “I have a heart of singing”, says Nyaruach. “Jal taught me how to rhyme.”

‘Woman have no rights’

Nyaruach's song uplifts women and girls in South Sudan who she says have “no rights, no matter how young you are” in a recent interview with Kenya's The Star.

South Sudanese women are among the most marginalized, and the conflict has made conditions untenable. More than 80 percent of those who have fled the violence in South Sudan are women and children.

South Sudan has gone through several rounds of failed and fragile peace negotiations, but data shows that women have been far less involved than men in the peace process, despite research that suggests including women at higher levels would improve stability.

Machar returned to South Sudan in October 2018 after two years in exile in South Africa to work with Kiir, but many are wary of the peace deal after five years of protracted conflict.

“Women in South Sudan have been treated by government soldiers and armed actors, including local militias, as spoils of the conflict”, UN investigators said in September 2018. “The plight of South Sudan’s women and girls should no longer be ignored”, they said — referring to disturbing testimonies of rape victims.

According to a 2017 survey issued by the International Rescue Committee and Global Women’s Institute, 65 percent of South Sudanese women interviewed had experienced physical or sexual violence.

Nyaruach has her own testimony.

[South Sudanese] men's ideas are changing about love. They get married to many wives and then destroy our lives. They fail to take care of their children properly. They rape us, use young girls, get us pregnant and leave us.”

Nyaruach says music is her calling. “If I hide what is killing me in my heart, what can I do to make a change?” she asks.

No wonder “Gatluak” is a hit. This is Nyaruach's chance to demand the men in her life to do better, not just in love but war — and peace.","A man named Gatluak is probably feeling a bit embarrassed as South Sudanese singer Nyaruach calls him out for being a “boring man with no plan” in a hit song shared widely since its release in June 2018.
Or, rather several Gatluaks — the name is common in South Sudan and “all know a Gatluak [who behaves this way]”, Nyaruach says.

Oxfam has warned Australia is at risk of falling even further behind in the climate change battle, isolating it from its neighbours in the region.

Oxfam Australia Climate Change Adviser Dr. Simon Bradshaw, who is in Poland for the United Nations’ annual climate change conference, said emissions had been rising since the current Federal Government took office and the government had persistently refused to strengthen Australia’s emissions reduction target.

“Australia has failed to heed the insurmountable evidence of what is needed to limit global warming – no more new coal, a shift to 100 per cent renewable energy as soon as possible and achieving zero emissions well before mid century,” stated Dr. Bradshaw.

Emissions Continue To Rise

The latest Quarterly Update of Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory showed Australia’s emissions for the June quarter 2018 increased 1.3 per cent over the previous on a seasonally adjusted and weather normalised basis.

Emissions for the year to June 2018 increased 0.6 per cent or 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, mainly driven by LNG production for export. Trend emissions increased by 1.2 per cent, largely due to a 15 per cent jump in coal production after a downturn in the March 2018 quarter.

There was some good news, with electricity sector emissions continuing to fall – a decrease of 2.8 per cent since June 2017. The reduction was primarily a result of increased renewable generation (14 per cent) in the National Electricity Market replacing a drop (13 per cent) in brown coal-fired electricity generation.

However, the overall picture for Australia remains grim. While the Morrison Government states otherwise, a recent UN report says Australia is not on track to achieve its Paris agreement target of reducing emissions by 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030.

Dr. Bradshaw states Oxfam has already seen first-hand the impacts of climate change in the Pacific, including the loss of land and livelihoods to rising sea levels and the effects of increasingly destructive storms.

“The time is now for the Australian Government – it must listen to its neighbours, it must listen to the stark warnings of the world’s leading scientists, it must listen to the concerns of its own residents, to our school children protesting in the streets,” said Dr. Bradshaw.

Oxfam, which called for a ban on the Adani project last year, has previously stated the pursuit of coal will reinforce poverty as a result of climate change impacts, and increase deaths and disease caused by pollution.

Adani Protesters Take To The Streets

In related news, thousands of Australians marched in the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns on the weekend, protesting against Adani’s Carmichael coal mine project in Queensland. Among the protesters were school students, some of whom had taken part in the School Strike For Climate Action – an event that earned the criticism of Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

School Strike For Climate Action organisers have further action planned, including another mass strike on 15th March 2019 in the lead-up to the federal election.","byOxfam has warned Australia is at risk of falling even further behind in the climate change battle, isolating it from its neighbours in the region.

There has also been no sanction of the Rwandan pro-government website allegedly run by the country’s military intelligence, which posted an article this week with a headline that contained unacceptable insults against Sisulu following her meeting with a former Rwandan General. The article remained up on the site for six hours before being taken down. Such insults levied against Rwanda's First Lady would be considered equally unacceptable.

“If prominent people in Rwanda can insult a foreign minister in South Africa, who else can they insult?” Sisulu said in reaction to Rwanda’s shocking personal attack on her. “If I was a man, they would not insult me like that.”

Minister Sisulu’s spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya has shot back saying: “Rwanda’s Deputy Minister is a male and tends to shoot from the hip. What is unacceptable is that he shoots from the hip about the foreign minister of South Africa who is a woman, and no-one stopped him.”

“Given we are in the process of normalising relations with Rwanda, one would have expected Rwanda’s foreign minister to have complained to President Kagame about the deputy minister’s behaviour on Sisulu’s behalf,” Mabaya told Independent Media.

In the wake of this week's fallout, other tweets have emerged on Twitter accounts supportive of the Rwandan government accusing Sisulu of not being objective on Rwanda given that she was married to the late Professor Rok Ajulu who had written papers challenging Rwanda's model of democracy.

Sisulu's spokesperson has quoted her in response to these attacks, ""I have been a minister for more than 20 years, and have never expressed myself on Rwanda, I have actually been a defender of Rwanda in cabinet."" According to Mabaya, when Sisulu became Minister for International Relations earlier this year, she had asked her Director General Kgabo Mahoai, ""When are we normalising relations with Rwanda?""

What gave rise to the sudden Rwandan vitriol against Sisulu was the fact that she had met with Rwandan dissidents based in South Africa in order to hear their views. Responding to a question at a press briefing on November 12 about progress made in normalising South Africa's relations with Rwanda, Sisulu had said that she had met with Nyamwasa in Johannesburg and was ""pleasantly surprised"" to hear that Nyamwasa, who had established an opposition party in South Africa, was willing to negotiate a reconciliation deal with the Rwandan authorities.

The remark unleashed unprecedented attacks on Sisulu in Rwanda. Rwanda's Deputy Foreign Minister Nduhungirehe had criticised the meeting on his Twitter account saying ""If any SA official wishes to negotiate with a convicted criminal in SA who is leading a subversive movement operating in our region, they are free to do so, but should never think of involving Rwanda into this negotiation.""

Rwanda's President Paul Kagame has become increasingly hostile towards critics of his government, cracking down on political opponents and journalists, many of whom have been arrested, disappeared and handed down draconian jail sentences. This week Kagame warned at a Rwandan Defence Forces Drill that ""Enemies of Rwanda will be dealt with decisively."" Kagame was specifically referring to Rwandan dissidents based in Burundi, which includes the Rwandan National Congress, which is linked to Nyamwasa.

Rwandan agents believed to have been operating from the Rwandan embassy in South Africa had attempted to assassinate Nyamwasa in his Johannesburg home in 2014, which led to South Africa expelling three Rwandan diplomats, and in retaliation Rwanda expelled six South African diplomats from Kigali. Since then Nyamwasa has survived a further two assassination attempts.

Nyamwasa, who had been part of the inner circle of the RPF since the time of the genocide, has been targeted by Kagame since his accusation that it was Kagame and not Hutu extremists who ordered the rocket attack on the plane carrying Rwanda's former President Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, that triggered the genocide. This is an accusation that Kagame has vehemently denied. In the aftermath of the genocide, Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Army was accused of carrying out mass killings of Hutu civilians.

The 2014 attempted assassination of Nyamwasa came on the heels of the assassination allegedly by Rwandan agents in 2013 of Patrick Karegeya, the former Rwandan Intelligence Head who was assassinated in a Sandton hotel.

Karegeya was once one of the most powerful figures in Rwanda, and had fled to South Africa in 2008 after falling out with Kagame. He had helped establish the opposition movement the Rwandan National Congress. Prior to his assassination, Karegeya had held a series of meetings with South African and Tanzanian intelligence officials at a time when both countries were sending troops to the DRC as part of a UN force to neutralise the M23 rebel group, largely considered a Rwanda proxy rebel force.

In the context of very limited free speech or open political space, Kagame won a third term in August last year with a reported 98.8 percent of the vote, after a 2015 referendum allowed him to run for a seven-year term and two additional five-year terms thereafter.

According to Human Rights Watch, before and after the election the Rwandan government continued to limit the ability of civil society groups, the media, international human rights organisations and political opponents to function freely and independently, or to criticise the government's policies and practices. Rwandan authorities continue to arrest and detain people in unofficial military detention centers, where scores of detainees have been tortured in recent years, according to Human Rights Watch reports.","“If prominent people in Rwanda can insult a foreign minister in South Africa, who else can they insult?” Sisulu said in reaction to Rwanda’s shocking personal attack on her.

247,https://www.thenational.com.pg/like-no-summit-on-earth/,"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The National,Like no summit on earth,"By RICHARD CARTER

I have covered a lot of summits.

I have battled sleep deprivation during all-night affairs in stuffy Brussels buildings as EU leaders scrambled to salvage the euro during the Greek debt crisis.

I have hob-nobbed at swanky gatherings in the snowy mountains of Davos as presidents, prime ministers and business tycoons put the world to rights over champagne and canapes.

More recently, I watched locals struggle to hold back the tears at a summit between the leaders of North and South Korea and, just a few months after that, the historic moment Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un clasped hands in Singapore.

But none of this could have prepared me for the absolutely unique experience that was the recent Apec summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea.

Let’s start with our digs.

A sizeable chunk of Port Moresby’s poverty-hit population lives in ramshackle slums, scratching out whatever living they can. There’s not much call for luxury hotels.

In addition, the dusty and sun-baked capital has acquired a reputation for lawlessness, with reports of the feared machete-wielding “raskol” street gangs mugging and beating people at random and carrying out frequent carjackings.

For these two reasons, journalists and delegates were housed not in the standard summit business hotel but on three colossal cruise ships moored in the bay.

“Like No Place On Earth” was the company motto and the full range of cruise facilities was available onboard: from the quoits deck to blackjack and roulette at the “Players” casino.

After a stressful day at the summit, attendees could choose between three sauna and steam rooms or splash in the jacuzzis and plunge pools up on the sun deck.

Evenings were generally spent in one of the many restaurants — mainly the copious buffet as it was free — followed by a nightcap in “Connections” or the “Orient” bar, complete with live music that ranged from chilled-out jazz to a band loudly belting out “Hotel California.”

It may sound nice but we did sometimes feel like we could check out any time we liked, but we could never leave.

We were instructed that under no circumstances should we venture out alone — especially after dark.

One of the great joys of summitry is when the work is done and the team heads out to sample local restaurants and bars, usually under the experienced guidance of the local AFP bureau chief.

But Port Moresby is one of only a handful of capitals where AFP does not have any presence at all so the summit was an endless series of shuttling between the Pacific Jewel ship and the city’s Aquatic centre which served as the press room for the international media.

That’s if you could get there.

The APEC summit was Papua New Guinea’s debut on the international stage and it visibly struggled with the logistics of hosting delegates from more than 21 countries plus the world’s media.

Much of the talk in the run-up to the summit surrounded the purchase of 40 Maserati luxury saloons to ferry around world leaders and the resulting cost to a city where tens of thousands live hand-to-mouth.

But despite throwing money at the situation, transport snafus seemed commonplace. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was kept in his car for more than five minutes waiting for the summit host Peter O’Neill to arrive.

I’m based in Tokyo and let me tell you that the Japanese don’t wait that amount of time for a metro, never mind a delay to the PM.

PNG authorities were proud of their shiny new buses — funded by China — to transport journalists and delegates seamlessly around the city but numerous delays and problems were reported.

At one point, a shuttle bus “direct to the press centre” took the AFP team to the parliament building and then on to the national museum. Only by begging the driver was it prevented from then going to the airport.

We finally got on our way — despite leaving more than two hours ahead of time to get to an interview, we were in serious danger of being late — when we sped too quickly down a hill and obliterated the front of the bus.

The result: more than an hour and a half to travel about five kilometres.

Another “direct bus to the press centre” just took me next door to the neighbouring cruise ship and then back again.

It wasn’t just transport. Small details that are run-of-the-mill for experienced summit hosts proved tricky for the PNG novices.

The “family photo” of the leaders was delayed when one delegation realised there was no lighting for the photographers and it was pitch black. Cue a mad scramble around the hotel which eventually unearthed a temporary light but the pictures were still far from perfect.

Then just minutes before a signing ceremony involving US Vice President Mike Pence, one eagle-eyed PNG official noticed that their own flag was upside down.

This turns out to be the international symbol for a country in distress, which was particularly unfortunate as the ceremony was about bringing electricity to millions in PNG who live without power.

But if the summit proved to be a logistic uphill battle, the frustration was eased by the people of Port Moresby who were employed in their thousands to help things run — well, less roughly.

Summit helpers were unfailingly kind, friendly and smiling — even when faced with furious journalists shouting at them because the internet crashed two minutes into Pence’s keynote speech.

But the real gem of the summit was not found in the sterile gym hall of the international media centre.

Without a bureau in Port Moresby — AFP covers the country from Sydney — this was a golden opportunity to tell stories from a rarely visited dateline.

So AFP teams ventured out — with a local driver and “fixer” — in an attempt to report on the real Port Moresby, which seemed a million nautical miles from the summit.

We visited markets, settlements, and shopping malls. We spoke to minority groups, housewives and passers-by who gave us a short burst of their tribal tongue on camera for a feature on the more than 800 languages in Papua New Guinea.

Everywhere we went, we were greeted with genuine warmth. Crowds would form immediately as locals could not believe the international media could be interested in them — little did they know they were in fact the most interesting part of the summit.

And despite the doomsday warnings, at no stage did I feel threatened or unsafe. Admittedly we didn’t hit the streets after sunset but I have felt more on edge wandering around parts of Paris or my native London at night.

Instead, we encountered grinning locals, their teeth stained red from constant munching of betel nut — an omnipresent narcotic banned in most countries — who told us they wanted to see some of the benefits of the Apec trickle down to them in their tough lives.

We visited a rickety settlement consisting of thousands of dwellings perched on stilts far out into the sea, with precarious wooden planks serving as “streets” and a caged pig outside almost every hut.

You don’t get that at an EU summit or G20.

When our bus broke down at the museum, who should come to our rescue but a local flower-seller, who bundled us, our copious video equipment, and a bemused Chinese journalist who was also stranded into her truck and gave us a lift. When the China Aid bus failed, PNG aid stepped up and we made our interview with minutes to spare.

And when the memories of the logistical snafus have long blended into the memories of a dozen other summits, it is the warmth from the PNG people that will endure.

I have covered a lot of summits. But none quite like the Port Moresby Apec and I doubt any of us ever will.

248,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/tijuana-migrant-numbers-down-by-3000/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Mexico News Daily,"Tijuana migrant numbers down by 3,000 but no one knows where they are","The whereabouts of around 3,000 Central American migrants is unknown after fewer than half of those in a Tijuana shelter were transferred to a new location.

More than 6,200 mainly Honduran migrants have arrived in the northern border city since mid-November and most had been staying in a sports complex that was converted into a temporary shelter.

However, government authorities announced last week that the migrants would be transferred from the Benito Juárez sports complex, whose grounds had become a quagmire after heavy rain, to a 9,000-square-meter-piece of land known as El Barretal, which is located in Tijuana’s eastern outskirts.

However, Rodolfo Hernández, president of the Baja California State Migrant Council, said that between last Thursday and yesterday only around 2,500 migrants had arrived at the new shelter while 300 remained in and around the previous one.

“. . . the rest, around 3,000 [migrants], nobody knows where they are,” he said.

“We’re asking other shelters to supply us with lists in order to know how many of them are in those places, others crossed the wall and went into the United States . . . We’re trying to carry out a census,” Hernández added.

Those who have moved to the new shelter, located in the notoriously violent neighborhood of Mariano Matamoros, say that conditions there are much-improved.

The El Barretal shelter has the capacity to house 2,500 people indoors and another 3,500 in an outdoor area, according to Tijuana Civil Protection authorities.

David Alejandro, a 23-year-old Honduran man, told the newspaper El Universal that there was a downpour on the last day he spent in the Benito Juárez sports complex, which ruined his few possessions.

“. . . We’re better off here . . . because there is hard ground here and there it was dirt that turned into pure mud . . . they say it’s going to rain again and we don’t have a roof here either but at least there is no mud,” he said.

Another migrant identified only as Alicia, who is accompanied by her three small children, said that living in the previous shelter in crowded conditions with no privacy and poor hygiene was difficult but that the rain made it impossible.

“. . . Here the children can play a little bit more because it’s not so dirty. They told us that women and the little ones are going to sleep indoors, that’s fine by me,” she said.

Some other migrants agreed to move to the new shelter but quickly began planning their departure.

Honduran Claudia Lorely, her husband Bryan José and two of their friends were among those who decided to leave, according to a report published by the news website Univision Noticias.

On Sunday, the four Hondurans, who left San Pedro Sula on October 13 as part of the first and largest migrant caravan, ate a Chinese meal outside the El Barretal shelter and stocked up on sports drinks before setting off for Playas de Tijuana, a neighborhood in the west of the city where the border fence separating Mexico from the United States meets the Pacific Ocean.

Once there, they planned to try to jump the fence to turn themselves into United States border patrol agents and request asylum.

“We’re going to hand ourselves in because we no longer see any other option,” Claudia said.

The Hondurans took the decision to try to cross the border illegally after coming to the realization that they wouldn’t be able to enter the United States as a group as they originally thought would be possible.

A daily “metering” system adopted by United States border authorities limits the number of migrants who are granted appointments at which they can begin the process to request asylum.

That system, coupled with an existing backlog of would-be asylum seekers who were already in Tijuana when the caravan arrived, means that most new arrivals will be forced to wait months or even years to plead their case to U.S. authorities with no certainty that they will be successful.

“It’s not as we thought it would be. We’re tired, desperate, it’s already been a long time since we left home and we want to see something clear,” Bryan said.

The United States border patrol said that 24 people were intercepted on the U.S. side of the border Saturday while more migrants have crossed or attempted to cross the border over the past two days.

Some migrants have decided to remain in Tijuana – at least for the time being – while others have sought assistance to return to their countries of origin.

Mario Madrazo, a director at the National Immigration Institute (INM), said that 453 migrants had voluntarily requested assistance to return home, adding that around 150 others would be deported after being arrested for committing misdemeanors or other crimes.

Around 100 migrants were arrested and deported after participating in a rush on the border on November 25 to which U.S. border agents responded with the use of tear gas.

Honduran migrant Yoselin Martínez told Univision that the number of people making snap decisions about their plans had spiked since Thursday when rumors began circulating that those transferred to the new shelter would be detained by immigration authorities and immediately deported.

Another migrant at the new shelter, 23-year-old Honduran Milson Martínez, who traveled more than 4,000 kilometers to the border with his partner, cousin and five-year-old nephew, said it was necessary to remain “level-headed” when planning any future move because “one could lose everything” with a poor decision.

“The truth is that they’re filling our heads with a lot of ideas, a lot of people think that those of us who are here are going to be deported . . . and others are enticing people to leave and cross the wall but I believe that we have to be calm and patient . . . We saw that we can’t enter as a group like we entered Guatemala, we have to wait,” he said.

“We know that Donald Trump’s heart won’t be touched by us, we know that it’s going to be difficult but for now we’re going to wait and see if they speed up the process to request asylum . . .”

Barnes, however, disagrees.

“Some members of the Jamaican Diaspora are convinced that they should be allowed to vote in elections in Jamaica. I disagree for a number of reasons,"" Barnes said.

""Most countries which indulge in this practice allow for overseas nationals to vote for a president, not individual members of parliament etc. In addition, I believe that the consequences of any vote is borne primarily by those living where the vote decision is executed, not those living in the Diaspora,"" he continued. ""While I totally agree that remittances not only help the financial viability of the country, this money is never sent directly to say the Bank of Jamaica or the finance ministry, but to individual members of families.”

Should Jamaicans in the Diaspora be allowed to vote? Yes 30% No 70%

Barnes also called on Jamaicans who live abroad and return to the island for vacation to curb their tendency to give the impression that they have loads of cash to spread around and that life in the US is a bed of roses.

“In a recent published interview, I asked Jamaicans in South Florida to not be fooled. Most of the people living in the US, whether native or immigrant, live what can be described as a lower middle class existence. Too many are deluded about the middle class and the suggestion there is no poor,"" Barnes said.

""Jamaicans are no exception. There are hard times to be endured in the US, hence when people return on visits, they need to cease and desist from 'popping style' when their vacation and gifting are possible only because of the facility of 'plastic', credit cards,"" he added, noting that ""Jamaicans are fooled by this behaviour pattern only if they allow themselves. There is enough U.S. produced cable television fare to convince one and all that the show is just that.""

In recent times, the murders of returning residents has come under the glare of the Diaspora, with many Jamaicans living abroad expressing fear to return to their native land to resettle due to a threat against their lives. Despite police blotters indicating that murders and other major crimes are decreasing, the fear lingers and crime is seen as a major turn off to many in the Diaspora.

Barnes agrees.

“Crime and violence is the main fear of Jamaicans. There is anecdotal evidence shared by persons who personally experience crime and violence during visits to Jamaica. Corruption is till noticed but not as a deterrent, like violence has been for the last decade or more,” he said.","Veteran Jamaican broadcaster and City Commissioner for the South Florida community of Miramar, Winston Barnes says Jamaicans who reside outside the country have no right to vote in the elections of the country of their birth.
“Some members of the Jamaican Diaspora are convinced that they should be allowed to vote in elections in Jamaica.

A government report, leaked to the Times of London, has indicated that there could be food shortages in Ireland in a no-deal Brexit scenario, and the economic impact on Ireland would be worse than in the UK.

This is based on the large number of food exports from the UK to Ireland (more than half of the total food imported to Ireland comes from the UK). In the event of a no-deal, trade rules would revert to those used by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but the UK would have to apply to become a member of the WTO to implement them.

At a Brexit event for local authorities held in Dublin this week, economist Dan O’Brien echoed those sentiments, adding that the threat of food shortages and supplies in a no-deal scenario shouldn’t be underestimated.

According to today’s article, the UK government report has indicated that there would be a 7% drop in GDP for Ireland, while the equivalent for the UK would be a drop of 5%.

Tory MP Priti Patel has told the paper that these warnings should have been used as leverage against Ireland to encourage them to drop the backstop.

“This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during negotiations? There is still time to go back to Brussels and get a better deal.”

Patel resigned as International Development Secretary last November after holding 12 meetings with Israeli groups and officials outside the proper protocol.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reacted to the story, saying that “The sheer moral bankruptcy of the Tory Brexiteers is on full display today.”

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

Ex-Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who is of Irish heritage, also reacted to the story, saying:

“…It amazes me that these expensively educated Brexiteers have literally learned nowt about the history of these very isles”.

The backstop, a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland, is seen as being unnecessary and restrictive by Brexiteers, as it could lock the UK into a customs arrangement that would stop them striking new trade deals with other countries.

This would mean Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the customs union if there is no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.

If there are different regulations or tariffs between the two jurisdictions, which would have to occur if the UK want to become more competitive than they are currently in the EU, then that would suggest products need to be checked as they go across the border.

Prominent British politicians, including the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg, have indicated that they would scrap the backstop if it were up to them (important to note if there is a Tory party leadership challenge).

DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also indicated that the provision to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland should be scrapped, chanting “bin the backstop” to applause at his party’s conference.

Meanwhile, as May’s deal looks set to be rejected by the House of Commons in next week, there are reports in the UK media that she is looking at the possibility of a second referendum if the deal does fail.","AS UK PRIME Minister Theresa May has just five days to try to rally support for her Brexit deal, a Tory MP has suggested using the possibility of food shortages in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit to encourage the EU to drop the backstop.

—Elena Ferrante

In “A Room of One’s Own,” Virginia Woolf says that for a woman to write fiction, she must have money and a room of her own. She highlights the limited opportunities for women during her time, as well as the historical invisibility of women’s voice in literature. (I could almost see her arteries bursting in anger when she went to the British Museum and found volumes of books about women—written by men!)

I started to develop a liking for writing in sixth grade. But my family had little money and I had no room of my own.

When you have no room of your own, you ache to know where your skin begins and ends. When you have no room of your own, you try to find a calm spot within yourself amid the sonic boom of shared living.

In being deprived of privacy, where everything in my life seemed to be communal — the bed, blanket, slippers, towels, utensils — I discovered how to build a room of my own without using cement and bricks.

Our family used to collectively sleep on a “papag,” a wooden bed. We’d rationalize the hardness of our bed by saying it improved our postures, that it made our spines as stiff as a bamboo pole.

When it rained, we placed plastic buckets over our heads and let the burble of water serve as a lullaby. I remember doing assignments with a pail of rainwater beside me. Even when I started menstruating, when I was already a “dalaga,” a young woman, I was crammed in between my brothers every night.

I made my “own room” in notebooks. As a high school student, I was a prolific diarist. And the main driving force behind my writing was the change in my body and consciousness: I was having crushes on boys.

Ultimately, I wrote a love letter to a boy when I was in first year. Delicate cursive on delicate stationery. I wrote it in English, and I might have used phrases like “chaos of my heart” or “melancholy in your eyes” to impress him.

Puppy love — a deep aspect of the young person’s emotional life where privacy is in its urgency. I made my love special by writing about it on notebooks and hiding it away from others. It was the only thing no one in the house could lay their hands on.

My parents were proud of my achievements at school. However, after high school, I stopped schooling because they couldn’t afford to send me to college. I wasn’t used to spending the whole day in the house. I would walk my way to the nearest mall in slippers and spend all my afternoon at a secondhand bookstore.

Booksale became “my room.” I was very happy that I could buy a book for as low as P5. I placed high sentimental value on my copy of Henry David Thoreau’s journal which I bought for P10 for my birthday in 2006.

I was lucky to have read him during the hungriest time of my youth. He gave dignity to my situation.

“Again and again, I congratulate myself on my so-called poverty,” he wrote in one of his entries. I dreamed of not only having a room of my own, but also a house in Walden Pond.

I wonder how many Filipino girls and boys have to grow up with no space they can call their own. I wonder how the claustrophobic layout of the house of the poor affects the sense of self of its young inhabitants.

Anyway, young people create their room elsewhere: under a big tree, on the streets, at online games. Or, sometimes, the skull is enough.

Having a simple room of my own is one of the most treasured aspects of my life right now. It has given me new life. I can spread my whole person on the bed, dance around with nothing on, invite people for sleepovers, make an altar to my inner life. This is Woolf’s ideal.

Would the days of sweet aloneness in my room end? I can’t imagine myself in bed sandwiched between some children and a man who, having shed the veneer of poise of the early stages of dating, now snores and farts unabashedly.

Is a woman born into the world so that generations could lean on her earthly tenderness during the innocent hours of repose? If so, it’s like a life cycle that can be expressed in a biblical parody: To crowded bed you were born, to crowded bed you shall return.

252,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/91653/republic_day_malta_president_coleiro_preca_speech_2018,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",MaltaToday,[WATCH] President’s final Republic Day speech: ‘No full democracy if we do not respect human dignity',"Malta’s ninth President of the Republic gave her final Republic Day speech today, in an address that sealed her legacy as the head of state who placed social justice and workers – be they Maltese or not – at the heart of the Maltese presidency.

A former Labour social policy minister who was appointed to her role in 2014, made her imploration to citizens, workers and business owners to leave nobody behind, and stay united in a country in which “nobody is made to suffer or to feel excluded.”

She will leave the presidency in April, with her speech today already representative of a legacy that delighted Maltese citizens with her attention to people and readiness to be close to the emarginated of Maltese society; in some cases she was criticised, for having knowingly ignored the ceremonial hauteur of the Presidency, something she was keen to remark on: “My gratitude also goes to those among us who have criticised me, perhaps at times in haste and with lack of forethought, because I have learnt from the experience.”

Her speech just days away from the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Coleiro Preca set much store by the historic treaty of 1948 in an appeal to Maltese citizens to welcome migrant workers with dignity.

“I believe that the Universal Declaration, alongside our Constitution, must always be the cornerstone of the ways in which we live together, and how we treat one another…

“For this reason, we must insist that the rights of visitors and newcomers to our islands, including migrants, must be upheld in their fullness, without complacency or favouritism.”

She was categorical about Malta not being ready to achieve the fullness of democracy if it tolerated the injustices that so many different members of society could be likely to endure: from early school-leavers, to victims of trafficking, to those living in poverty, to discriminated women, to the weak representation of women MPs, and even where clientelism triumphs over meritocracy.

“If these injustices persist then we will not be enjoying the fullness of our democracy and the safeguarding of our human dignity... Furthermore, no economy can celebrate human dignity, unless the needs of the most vulnerable are kept at the heart of its operations,” Coleiro Preca said in an undeniable statement on the breakneck speed of Malta’s economy.

In a rejoinder to Malta’s post-war history and the setting up of its national health service and welfare system, Coleiro Preca reminded leaders of the protection this had endowed so many thousands of Maltese and Gozitan citizens from the threat of poverty and social exclusion.

“I appeal for this social welfare system to remain a priority, above and beyond the pursuit of economic advances. The past has shown us that, even in the absence of economic abundance, it is possible to protect those of us who are most in need, because this is the right thing to do.”

And then she turned to Labour’s leaders, but also those who support its economic policy, by urging them to develop “a culture of permanent social solidarity” during this time of unprecedented growth.

The warning against worshipping at the altar of economic growth seemed to be also present in her warning on the forthcoming European elections.

“When governments abandon the social contract in favour of excessive private accumulation of profit… People not only lose hope in the established political class, but also, they seek reassurance in populist ideologies.”

Placing her finger on the source of discontentedness across Europe, she said leaders would be powerless to urge people to disregard populist forces when millions were living in deprivation or feeling irrelevant. “When ‘social Europe’ is becoming more of an ‘economic Europe’, it is unacceptable that 1 in 4 Europeans is living in poverty, and is thereby excluded from the services that used to make Europe so proud.

Again, she punctured the establishment’s abandon to the great white hope of Artificial Intelligence and digital technology by warning its effects on democracy – a reminder of the Cambridge Analytica scandal: “It is essential for us to ensure that our democracy is not manipulated, from behind the scenes, by corporations that transform the intimate details of our lives into a commercial product. A manipulated democracy is false and dangerous, because it distinguishes between a superior class with knowledge at its disposal, and a sub-class that carries on a lower quality of life, because it lacks the necessary knowledge.”

While welcoming a steering committee on constitutional reform and the appointment of a parliamentary standards czar, Coleiro Preca made an important statement on the abuse of freedom of expression and social media.

“Today, anyone can presume to be some kind of journalist, by passing on his or her views through modern means of communication. Unfortunately, some individuals abuse these means of communication, without taking into account the consequences of their actions. The media, therefore, shoulders a higher responsibility to report the truth.

“Fake news has become the order of the day, with the risk that people will believe it and be alienated from the truth. I therefore urge those who use social media, to be respectful in the way they communicate their diverse views.”

She also called on those in public life to be measured and respectful and set a good example when communicating, while encouraging journalists to maintain the highest levels of journalistic ethics and “overcome the challenges being posed by sensationalism, prejudice, half-truths, and outright lies.”

Coleiro Preca ran the gamut of subjects that have characterised 2018 in Malta: children, migrants, housing, poverty, property prices, the environment, the elderly, as well as teachers, where she implored leaders to ensure that educators receive the best resources.

She also spoke of her serious concern that the more education a woman acquires, the greater the gender pay gap and the disparity in income. “It is my hope that in the years to come, through affirmative action, this gap will not only close in terms of pay, but we will also see a greater presence of women in positions of leadership in our country.”","“If these injustices persist then we will not be enjoying the fullness of our democracy and the safeguarding of our human dignity...

Yesterday, BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Rizvi Ahmed claimed that around 150 party candidates so far came under attack from AL men across the country.

Such attacks are being carried out in all the constituencies right under the nose of law enforcers, he said at the party's Nayapaltan central office in the capital.

BNP candidates in Bogura, Sirajganj, Gazipur, Jamalpur, Manikganj and Patuakhali alleged that a level playing field was absent in the districts and law enforcers were working in favour of the ruling party.

In Chattogram, at least 10 people, including a son of Liberal Democratic Party President Oli Ahmed, were injured in an attack in Satkania upazila's Keuchia yesterday.

Conservative Party MPs backed the embattled leader 200-117 on Wednesday (UK time).

It leaves Ms May weakened but immune from a further internal challenge for a year.

Speaking after the vote, Ms May said ""we need to get on with the job of delivering a Brexit that delivers on the vote"".

But she also acknowledged ""a significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me"".

Count official MP Graham Brady said ""the result of the ballot held this evening is that the parliamentary party does have confidence in Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party"".

But leading Brexit rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg, who helped trigger the vote by writing a letter of no confidence in Ms May, said it was a ""terrible result"".

""She ought to go and see the queen and resign urgently,"" he told the BBC.

And Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage tweeted that Ms May ""limps on to her next failure, the deal won't pass and the real crisis is close.""

MPs Margot James and Sarah Wollaston tweeted that they were supporting Ms May.

Before the vote, Ms May reportedly told MPs she plans to quit before the 2022 election.

There was some doubt about whether Ms May had unequivocally ruled out leading the party into any snap general election should her government fall before 2022.

But MP Nick Boles said she had been ""crystal clear"" that she would not lead the party into the next general election.

""She now deserves the support of all Conservative MPs so she can get on with the job of delivering a Brexit compromise that can win a Commons majority,"" Mr Boles tweeted.

Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg was not convinced by her promise, saying ""intention is one of those politicians' dangerous words that one should never rely on.""

'Fight with everything I've got'

Ms May on Wednesday vowed to fight ""with everything I've got"" a bid by her own party to oust her over her unpopular Brexit deal.

The vote was sparked by anti-EU lawmakers in her Conservative Party who want a cleaner break from the other 27 nations when Britain leaves on March 29.

The challenge plunged Britain into its biggest political crisis since Ms May took office after a 2016 referendum triggered the island nation's departure from the European project after 46 years.

Many of her cabinet ministers and senior MPs quickly rallied around her and the pound rose on British media reports that enough had already declared their backing for her to win.

Yet a victory may do little to resolve Ms May's ultimate problem: she is desperately short of the votes needed to get her draft withdrawal deal through parliament and time is quickly running out.

Ms May issued a defiant statement in Downing Street promising to ""contest (Wednesday's) vote with everything I've got"".

She warned that her ouster would spark a leadership contest that leaves the terms on which Britain pulls away from its main trading partner uncertain for weeks - ""delaying or stopping Brexit"".

""I stand ready to finish the job,"" she said.

'Flush out extremists'

Brexit supporters have for months threatened to submit the 48 letters from MPs needed to trigger a confidence vote designed to get a more devout eurosceptic to head the government.

The last batch came in after Ms May - facing a heavy defeat - sparked fury among MPs by delaying a parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday on the deal she agreed with the EU last month.

A clutch of senior ministers rallied round in support - including many who might succeed her - within minutes of the vote's announcement.

""The last thing our country needs right now is a Conservative Party leadership election,"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said in a tweet designed to play down his own leadership aspirations.

AAP

Finance minister Philip Hammond said Ms May's victory would unite the party and ""flush out the extremists who are trying to advance a particular agenda which would really not be in the interests of the British people"".

Seeking concessions

Ms May was informed of the challenge after returning late Tuesday from a tour of European capitals in an attempt to salvage her Brexit deal.

She had promised MPs when she delayed the vote that she would seek ""assurances"" about their concerns on a so-called ""backstop"" plan to keep open the border with Ireland after Brexit.

Some Conservative MPs and Ms May's Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) fear a plan for a temporary customs arrangement with the EU will become permanent.

Ms May received sympathy from EU partners on her trip but firm rejections of any attempt to reopen a Brexit deal that was only secured after 17 months of talks.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday - the day after meeting Ms May in Berlin - that she still ""has hope for an orderly exit"" but ""no intention to change the exit agreement"".

""We have little time, but we still have time,"" the German leader said.

Ms May cancelled a trip to Dublin on Wednesday for talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. She is still expected to attend an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.

Down to the wire

Ms May has said the parliamentary vote on Brexit will be held by January 21.

Lawmakers fear it might be delayed even further and a furious opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused May of being ""contemptuous of parliament"".

University of Westminster policy professor Pippa Catterall said it would be in Ms May's interest to delay the vote until the process was ""down to the wire... so in the end parliament is faced with the choice: my deal or no deal"".

“I don't have any desire to go to power by any means...if we can get elected by people's vote, then it's Alhamdullillah. If we can't retain power, there is no problem. Let peace prevail in the country,” she said.

Hasina was addressing the Businessmen Conference 2018 in the capital's Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The programme titled “Bangladesh towards peace and prosperity” was organised by Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).

The PM said her party wanted to see a peaceful election in the country as many political parties would contest the December 30 parliamentary polls.

The AL president said a peaceful situation was prevailing in the country. “Let the election be held maintaining this peaceful atmosphere. The party which will win the people's mandate will be in power.”

The country would advance further if the peaceful situation prevailed, she added.

The PM sought support from the businesses community for “boat”, the AL's electoral symbol, to maintain the pace of development and finish the incomplete development projects to make the country a developed one.

“We've taken up so many projects including some mega projects that we need more time to complete those.”

Describing the private sector as the driving force of the country's economy, the PM said the sector would be the key player and the government would act as its facilitator.

Hasina said the drives against militancy, terrorism and drugs would continue and the government would show “zero tolerance” against corruption.

Terming Hasina the “symbol of hope” for the business community and common people, top business leaders said they wanted to see her as the country's PM for next term again.

They extended their full support to the “zero tolerance” policy against corruption.

“The business community wants a leader who have vision, courage, cooperation and whose doors are always open for them,” FBCCI President Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin said.

The PM was the last resort to resolve any problem of industries, owners and workers and she stood as the “guardian for development”, he added.

By Dirisu Yakubu

Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, in the 2019 general elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has pledged to form a government of national unity if elected into power.

Trump names ex-Bush official William Barr as new attorney general

The former Vice President stated this yesterday at a meeting in Abuja with leaders of the Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, who earlier in the week, endorsed him as their sole Presidential candidate.

A visibly elated Atiku told the opposition leaders to dismiss any fear of a cabal in his government stressing that since same would be broad-based, no room would exist for a cabal to operate in the corridors of power.

He said: “I want to commit myself to the continuation of the doctrine a government of national unity.

“We believe as a political party in a government of national unity and there must be stability before you can do anything, whether to implement your economic programme or implement your healthcare programme. Right from the beginning, I have been a member of the PDP and I know we have always believed in a government of national unity. It takes a long time for a country as diverse as Nigeria to be united and stable even before we start talking about which ethnic group we come from or which religion we practice.

“I want to assure you that as long as we are having a government of national unity, there will not be a cabal”, he said

He called on the coalition to do a public presentation of its decision to work together “so that Nigerians will be further enlightened, so that every nook and cranny of this country can be informed.”

On the clamour for the participation of young people in partisan politics, Atiku said what is paramount is the involvement of all and sundry, adding that democracy as a process does not pitch the old against the young.

“Democracy is not a process where one group replaces the other but it is a process where all groups participate. It is not a process where one group, young or old, rich or poor exclude the other but a process where everybody participate,” he noted.

Amidst a thunderous applause from the crowd, Atiku narrated his journey into politics, stressing that were it not for the effort of democracy advocates like him, President Muhammadu Buhari would not be seeking participation in the polity today.

“In the 1980s when some of us joined politics, the reason was to drive the military out of power and restore democracy. That was what late General Yar ‘ Adua told me. He said, come and join me. I was in my late 30s and in the public service. I abandoned it and followed him. That was the beginning of my political career.

“If we did not drive the military, he won’t be here today talking about political parties and wanting to be President,” he stated.

Nigerians are hungry— Saraki

Also speaking, Senate President, Bukola Saraki said President Buhari since his election in 2015 has demonstrated a lack of capacity to find solution to the question of hunger and poverty in the land.

He called on the coalition to work hard to ensure victory for Atiku whom he described as a man “who understands the issues.”

He said: “The message everywhere we go is that this country must move forward and we have agreed that the existing President must give way because he is not leading us in the right direction.

“We have met with Nigerians all over the country, the old, the not-too-old and the message is that the President cannot lead us the right way.

“We must be part of the process to usher in a new direction. The most important thing is that we want a change, a new direction. We want a man that understand the issues.

“We have been to three zones and there is a common message and that message is one of insecurity and hunger. Everywhere in this country, hunger and poverty are the issues. So the challenge before us is how to bring back prosperity to this country. Unfortunately, our President today cannot do it. He cannot do it because he does not have the ability to do so.

“Government alone cannot bring prosperity to this country because close to 80% of the revenue of government are going into personnel and servicing of debts. The remaining percentage cannot bring about development.

“To bring development to this country today, you need an environment that encourages people to bring in investment. Nigerians are even afraid to bring out their monies and so they need somebody that they have confidence will bring about the right environment for their business.

“At the moment, the verdict is that this government and this President do not give that confidence and without that investment, we are going no where,” he said.

The meeting which held at the Kano Hall of Transcorp Hilton was attended by prominent opposition leaders including Olagunsoye Oyinlola (national chairman, African Democratic Congress, ADC) Peter Ameh (national chairman, Progressive Peoples Alliance, PPA), Gershom Benson (national chairman, Democratic Peoples Party, DPP) among others.

All Barotzis should take comfort in this entire truth. It is the normal and legal route to attain though anomalous to some, while the unjustified coerced Zambian-ship has been absurd and illegal. No matter and no amount of Zambian tactics of divide and rule fueled through ethnic infighting and the like will help to the contrary, Barotseland is a country as ever before, since medieval ages. This resonates well with Tiger Woods’ famous quote that “The only reason why I enter an event is to win. There’s no sense in going into a tournament if you don’t believe you can win it.”

Imagine this statement from a sports point of view! What more with Barotse Change involving our very fabric in being Barotzis, I ask? Certainly, the procrastinated Barexit Phase 2 cannot be construed as a failure but simply deferment! This premises our reflections in this message which could not come at a better time than this – a reflective season and transitional time from one year, 2018, to another chronicled 2019. While it is true that each year that passes by gets us closer to the realization of the ultimate Barexit Phase 2 (true for progressive people counting time forward) some of our people (counting time backwards in retrogress) get despondent that it is taking too long! Well, perhaps it is time to remember that victory belongs to the most persevering and that the harder the battle the sweeter the victory. We have achieved a lot thus far together and now ultimate victory is in sight. Thumbs up, cheer up Malozi and continue working at your Barotse Change until it is done. The South African Freedom icon Nelson Mandela once said: “it is never done until it is done”! That must be our constraining response and argument into the ensuing New Year 2019.

THE 2012 BNC UDI MANDATE IS PROCLAIMED VICTORY PART 1 FOR BAROTSELAND.

The essence of real victory in Barotseland’s case is not finally winning our political argument against Zambia but rather overcoming the besetting Barotzish traits in our individual characters that make us dissidents, cowards, betrayers, diffidents and so on against the express command of our famous 2012 BNC Resolutions and UDI Mandate. That is the apex of our ultimate liberation we seek – more human than it is political. That is, while we still have Zambia to vacate our independent territory we individually need to overcome our Zambian-ship mindset and replace it with a patriotic and nationalistic proudly Barotzish mindset. The truth some of our people and Zambians refuse to understand is that the 2012 BNC is not negotiable and was very legal with no other substitute than complete independence.

Contrary to views advanced by some folks the declared UDI Mandate simply demands complete independence because providentially, by the action of the 2012 BNC UDI Mandate Barotseland legally accepted Zambia’s desire to completely disengage with Barotseland. In effect, the BA ’64 became defunct perpetually and the case considered settled, at least in the minds of civilized international communities and law-abiding global citizens! IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL TERMS THE 2012 BNC ACTION SERVED TO APPROVE THE GULF OF SEPARATION INITIATED BY ZAMBIA ON BAROTSELAND – NORTHERN RHODESIA UNION TREATY, such that it NOW REMAINS AN IRREFUTABLE AND IRREPARABLE BREACH! The 2012 BNC seating unequivocally proclaimed Victory Part 1 over Zambia’s subjugation of our country and marked Barexit Phase 1 towards the complete independence herein referred to as Barexit Phase 2.

THE IMPENDING GENUINE POLITICAL DIALOGUE A MARK OF VICTORY PART 2 FOR BAROTSELAND

1. Barexit Phase 2 of the Victory will be marked by what Barotseland is seeking now as the complete settlement of separation marked by complete departure and disinterested or unconditional withdrawal of all Zambian administration offices and personnel from Barotseland. Yes, this too has no substitute and it is coming! First and foremost, we need to remember that the long-awaited dialogue between Barotseland and Zambia is political in nature. Barotse Change defines the Political Dialogue as a discussion of POLITICAL BELIEFS and POLITICAL POSITIONS between Barotseland and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), over Barotseland’s sovereign statehood status quo, to resolve the impasse, with a view to reaching an amicable, complete and satiated settlement of the long-drawn-out disagreement and overdue disengagement.

2. We welcome all efforts aimed at the logical and amicable resolution of the political stalemate between Zambia and Barotseland, for this has been our ardent call ever since 2012 BNC. The key reasons advanced for this cause are:

a. That since negotiations in founding the failed unitary statehood of Zambia begun with the tripartite political dialogue (externally in London) it is only very logical now to conclude the reverse process with another tripartite political dialogue (externally also, not Lusaka) for the resounding resolution of the expired or defunct Barotseland agreement(BA ’64) TREATY.

b. Without the political dialogue, there can only be FORCED SETTLEMENT, as an eleventh-hour effort, with dire consequences on both Barotseland and especially, Zambia with more infrastructures compared to the politically and economically 'desertified' Barotseland.

c. Apart from being a means to amicable resolution of negative conflicts political dialogue, when well-intended, becomes a powerful tool in STATE BUILDING, in this case, both state of Barotseland and Zambia, owing to a number of benefits inherent in the process. Remember that Barotseland is in spite of everything erroneously called “Western Province” and Northern Rhodesia roguery called “unitary Zambia”.

d. Genuine Political dialogue is one powerful technique available for PEACE BUILDING between warring parties. There has been a war by Northern Rhodesia on Barotseland since 1969 resulting in killings, arrests, forced annexation and other forms of human rights violations of Barotzis by “Zambia”. Today many Barotzis have been fired or retired on “national interest” –meaning that we are not Zambians indeed but Barotzis; hence urgent need for the separation.

e. Lastly, without the meaningful and conclusive political dialogue both Barotseland and Zambia may not really grow and mature as individual states and nations among others! Inevitably animosity and war will be the order of the day between the two countries mostly due to Barotzis’ heightened National Consciousness on one hand and Zambia’s dissidence, impunity and vainglory on the other side.

To have a glimpse of expectations from Barotseland we need to glance over some key elements comprising a genuine political dialogue:

ELEMENTS OF GENUINE POLITICAL DIALOGUE

The reader may wish to know that Political Dialogue itself is not a mere discussion but a complex conversational process with considerations including, but not limited to, the following:

1. PRINCIPLES:

The respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights like Barotseland’s self-determination, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as for the Principle of the Rule of Law, should underpin the internal and international policies of the Parties and constitute an essential element of any agreement resulting from Political Dialogue like the long-awaited Barotseland – Zambia dialogue. Parties must ready themselves for commitment and compliance accordingly, to the principles. Zambia the offending state party should show all readiness?

2. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

This element of political dialogue requires that all parties confirm their joint objective of strengthening their relations, as new neighbours, by developing their political dialogue and reinforcing their cooperation for instance on trade, on investments, and on economic relations and others working towards creating conditions under which, for instance, Southern Africa regionalization becomes more feasible and mutually beneficent especially to member states; both new and old. In my view, this way Zambia will best honour the peace protocols and conventions it has ratified as a member of UN, AU, SADC and others. The scope of the dialogue in 1964 was unitary statehood of Zambia. Therefore, POST 2012 THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE CANNOT BE LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY CORRECT TO HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE TODAY IN LIGHT OF OUR ACTUAL POLITICAL TRUISM. There is no room for Federalism or Restoration of the defunct BA ’64 that was not ratified in the first place BUT COMPLETE SEPARATION of the states parties to the defunct BA ’64 as the only valid restoration agenda.

3. MECHANISMS:

With this element, the Parties are required to agree that their political dialogue shall be conducted at certain appropriate levels and facilitated by appropriate arbiters. Key on the list is top government officials, workers, citizens, civil societies and making maximum use of diplomatic channels and external arbitrators. Therefore, Zambia will show its readiness for genuine dialogue by unconditionally releasing our jailed RBG leaders with Britain also being ready to come to the party once again or finding a proxy arbiter, because our way in on 18th May 1964 is our way out Post 27th March 2012 BNC!

4. METHODOLOGY:

The Tripartite Parties agree on the implementation strategy by specified means, striving for political and social stability to deepen the regional integration process and reducing poverty within a sustainable development framework in Southern Africa. This can take the form of technical, financial, training assistance, or any other means agreed upon by the Parties in the context of the principle, objectives, mechanisms and areas of cooperation; all aimed at effecting a transparent and accountable management of process resources in the effective settlement of the disagreement and disengagement.

5. COOPERATION:

If this element was highly considered in the pre-1964 process side it is more imperative now in the globalizing world we are part of. Since Political dialogue can be an endogenous process to enhance capacity, institutions and legitimacy of the state driven by state-society relations in the fields of conflict prevention, trade, human rights, governance, regional integration, trade, custom, human resource relocation, etc. it becomes inclusively and expediently important to consider the element for the sake of the political and economic health of the new states in making; Barotseland and Zambia.

6. PERIODIC REVIEWS

This political dialogue process element requires a periodic appraisal of the implementation progress, regarding disengagement settlement, every after a specified period to be agreed upon by the Tripartite Political Dialogue Team. Unfortunately, this aspect was lacking in the beginning, giving Zambia a leeway to behave as history has aptly recorded. This latitude should be sealed off this time around, for “once beaten twice shy”.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT MATTER

Since there is no substitute for victory in our Peaceful War against Zambia Barotse Change, therefore, welcomes GENUINE POLITICAL DIALOGUE that can finally settle amicably the political stalemate between the once unitary statehood partners of Zambia, provided such lobbying and importunate calls are based on the following CONDITIONS, considered herein:

1. Foremost, that “Zambia” should stop further deceitful assertions but openly acknowledge the separation that already exists, instead of advancing frantic fears against complete disengagement with Barotseland. Both countries openly acknowledged and educated their masses over the attempted and purported unitary statehood, prior to BA ’64 signing. Barotseland has done her part already and still continues updating Barotzis on the imminent complete separation.

2. Premising the political dialogue on finalizing the complete separation or disengagement of Barotseland and Zambia AND NOT the opposite; forced integration or annexation.

3. Assurance that the GRZ does not plan to use the political dialogue as a tool to procrastinate any longer the valid meaning and significance of the whole separation process.

4. Establishing the context of the political dialogue as Peace-building and State-building of both Barotseland and “Zambia” that have been dormant and fiction or rogue respectively, for years.

5. Pledging commitment and compliance to the endogenous process meant to enhance states capacities and legitimacy of the states, driven by societies - states - global relations.

Then, in conclusion, BAREXIT PART 3 for Barotseland will set in purely for the Celebration of the Victory, Reconciliation and Healing of the Barotse nation. Merry festive season and prosperous New Year 2019 compatriots and fellow citizens, remembering that in Barotseland’s fight against Zambia’s colonialism there is no substitute for victory poised as complete independence.

However, his two co-accused, his former staff Richard Cambe and businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles, were not lucky and were sentenced to reclusion perpetua after being convicted of plunder.

They are also ordered to return to the National Treasury P124 million.

Apart from the testimony of a handwriting expert and Revilla’s denial that he signed the documents used as evidence against him, the anti-graft court said the testimonies of whistleblowers showed that their fellow whistleblower Benhur Luy was the one who forged the signatures.

“Marina Sula, Merlina Sunas and Mary Arlene Baltazar even categorically revealed when they testified for the defense that Benhur Luy was the sole author thereof,” the court cited.

Because of this, the court said it is “highly improbable if said signatures in those documents could ever constitute smoking guns at all against accused Revilla regarding the charge against him.”

“The consequence of this factual finding that the purported signature of accused Revilla is a forgery constitutes a great blow to the prosecution,” ruled the anti-graft court.

Under the case, Revilla is accused of having amassed P224 million in kickbacks from Napoles, in exchange for choosing her non-government organizations (NGO) to implement ghost projects funded by his PDAF.

In its decision, the anti-graft court said that the testimonies of whislteblowers Benhur Luy and Merlina Sunas was “able to establish that monies totaling Php 238,447,500.00 were given to and received by accused Cambe but could not establish the fact that the said sums were received by Revilla.”

“For the testimony to establish the fact of receipt of the kickback by Revilla would be considered as hearsay,” it stressed.

“The fact that the lawmaker, in this case Revilla, requested for the release of his PDAF and then endorsed the NGO to the Implementing Agency to be the latter’s partner in the implementation of the project funded by the PDAF, if indeed he made such endorsement considering that his signature found on the endorsement letters are forged does not lead a logical persons to assume that he knows that Napoles and Cambe are ‘making money’ from the project and he is part of the scheme,” it added.","Former Senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. has been acquitted on Friday (Dec. 7) of plunder by the Sandiganbayan 1st Division after having proved his signatures were forged concerning his alleged involvement in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam.
However, his two co-accused, his former staff Richard Cambe and businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles, were not lucky and were sentenced to reclusion perpetua after being convicted of plunder.
“Marina Sula, Merlina Sunas and Mary Arlene Baltazar even categorically revealed when they testified for the defense that Benhur Luy was the sole author thereof,” the court cited.
Because of this, the court said it is “highly improbable if said signatures in those documents could ever constitute smoking guns at all against accused Revilla regarding the charge against him.”“The consequence of this factual finding that the purported signature of accused Revilla is a forgery constitutes a great blow to the prosecution,” ruled the anti-graft court.
