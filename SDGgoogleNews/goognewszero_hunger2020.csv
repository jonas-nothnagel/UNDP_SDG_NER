India has performed dismally on UN’s Sustainable Development Goals with only seven Indian states successfully addressing “hunger and malnutrition”. The worst performers in the zero hunger goal were Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Overall, India performed worse than last year with its score falling from 2018’s 48 to 38 in 2019, according to NITI Aayog’s report on Sustainable Development Goals 2019. The same is in line with the findings of Global Hunger Index 2019 which was released in October 2019. The SDG 2019 report also highlights special attention is needed towards achieving zero hunger goal. “Two goals — 2 (zero hunger) and 5 (gender equality) demand special attention, as the overall country score is below 50,” the report said.

Despite India’s agricultural produce going up by six times in the last 70 years, food loss and wastage keep millions hungry. More than one in every three children aged below five is stunted in India and 40% of children aged between 6-59 months are anaemic. “It is important to emphasise that hunger is a problem not because there is not enough food for everyone… Food wastage and loss remain a major concern… Globally nearly 40% of the fruits and vegetables, and 30% of cereals that are produced are lost,” the report said.

However, some states and Union Territories have performed well in achieving the goal. “Goa and Chandigarh are the top-performing among States and UTs, respectively. Seven states and two UTs bagged a position in the category of Front Runners (with Index score higher than/equal to 65),” the report said. Besides Goa and Kerala, these states include mostly north-eastern states — Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.

Talking about India’s hunger issue, Chanchalapathi Dasa, Vice-chairman, Akshaya Patra, had earlier told Financial Express Online that the government needs to infuse more money in child nutrition to combat hunger. Akshaya Patra Foundation works with the government for Poshan Abhiyan or Child Nutrition program.","More than one in every three children aged below five is stunted in India and 40% of children aged between 6-59 months are anaemic.

INTRODUCTION

Achieving Zero Hunger is central to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, to which Zambia is a signatory.

Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) calls on the Member States of the United Nations to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. In particular, SDG 2 aims to end hunger and ensure all people have access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round; end all forms of malnutrition; double the agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders; maintain the genetic diversity of seeds; increase investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, and technology development; correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in agricultural markets; and promote functional food markets in order to control food price volatility.1

The Zero Hunger Challenge is a mechanism that allows countries to systematically articulate how they plan to achieve SDG 2 by 2030. It identifies five key areas or pillars, which countries must achieve in order to effectively end hunger and malnutrition. These pillars include ensuring 100% access to adequate food all year round; zero stunted children under the age of two; all food systems are sustainable; 100% increase in smallholder productivity and income, and zero loss or waste of food.

The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) is committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to reporting on progress towards the SDG 2 goals and targets. These global goals and targets are consistent with the African Union’s commitment to eliminate hunger and food insecurity by 2063, and Zambia’s priorities in the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP). The 7NDP lays out national strategies to address food and nutrition challenges in the first development outcomes under economic diversification and human development. These strategies are consistent with the five pillars of the Zero Hunger Challenge and are pertinent to ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030. The Zambia Zero Hunger Challenge is thus effectively anchored at the highest political level in the Country.

The GRZ commissioned the Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR) to lay out in a comprehensive manner the status, trends, responses and gaps in the five pillars of the Zero Hunger Challenge. The review recommends actions needed to achieve SDG 2 by 2030.

OBJECTIVES

The review provides a situational analysis of food and nutrition security in Zambia to contextualise the challenges and opportunities of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030. Based on this overview, a number of priority actions and milestones are recommended as the basis of a Road Map to Zero Hunger. This provides clarity on the specific roles that the private sector, civil society, and other non-governmental stakeholders would play in helping Zambia achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. The proposed strategic objectives and initiatives will strengthen Government efforts in ensuring the country achieves the food and nutrition security outcomes of the Seventh National Development Plan. The specific objectives of the review are as follows:","Executive SummaryINTRODUCTIONAchieving Zero Hunger is central to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, to which Zambia is a signatory.

MANILA -- To free more Filipinos from hunger and achieve food security, President Rodrigo Duterte has created an inter-agency task force on zero hunger.

Duterte signed Executive Order 101 on January 10 creating an inter-agency task force on zero hunger which will be chaired by Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.

Serving as his vice-chairperson is Social Welfare Secretary Joselito Bautista.

Members of the task force include the Agriculture Secretary, Agrarian Reform Secretary, Budget Secretary, Education Secretary, Environment Secretary, Health Secretary, Labor Secretary, Interior Secretary, Trade Secretary, Science Secretary, Communications Secretary, National Economic and Development Authority Director-General, and the Commission on Higher Education Chairperson.

In the EO, Duterte recognized that involuntary hunger, food security, undernutrition, and child wasting, stunting and mortality, continue to be serious concerns in the country.

“There is a need to carefully coordinate, rationalize, monitor and assess the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities to ensure a whole-of-government approach to eradicating hunger and achieving food security,” Duterte said.

The task force will be assigned to formulate a National Food Policy (NFP), which will outline national priorities based on a comprehensive understanding of the problem of hunger and related issues, and will provide a roadmap for achieving zero hunger, taking into consideration existing laws and issuances, as well as international law and treaty obligations.

Under the NFP, initiatives for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture will be identified.

It will coordinate and rationalize the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities to ensure a “whole-of-government” approach to attaining zero hunger and at the same time evaluate, through the identification of key performance indicators, the government's progress in ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

Technical working groups from among its member-agencies will also be formed to address particular concerns relative to the implementation of this Order.

Finally, the task force will also prepare and submit to the President annual reports on the state of hunger, food security, nutrition and agricultural production in the country, as well as the task force's initiatives and recommendations.

Support and assistance of other government agencies and instrumentalities may also be sought by the task force. Meanwhile, local government units are enjoined to render necessary assistance to the task force.

Initial funding requirements for the implementation of this order will be charged against the current appropriations of the member-agencies of the task force.

However, budgetary requirements for the succeeding years will be included in the annual budget proposals of the concerned agencies.

The order takes effect immediately.

Based on the third quarter of 2019 Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey results fielded from Sept. 27 to 30, 2019, 9.1 percent or an estimated 2.3 million families experienced involuntary hunger at least once in the past three months.

The figure is lower than the 10 percent or an estimated 2.5 million in June 2019 and 9.5 percent or about 2.3 million families in March 2019.

Nograles expressed hope that fewer Filipinos will suffer from hunger with programs like the Enhanced Partnership Against Hunger and Poverty (EPAHP), an initiative to help mitigate hunger, ensure food and nutrition security, and reduce poverty in urban and rural communities, including marginalized communities.

Agencies which are a part of EPAHP are the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Education, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Trade and Industry, National Anti-Poverty Commission, National Irrigation Administration, and Landbank.

He tweeted that it was a “disgrace” that the historic street lacked greenery “crucial for the environment – carbon, air quality – but also for mental health and wellbeing”.

Leaving aside the debate on whether trees would spoil Regent Street’s aesthetic, or the fact that Regent’s Park is only a stroll away, Stewart is largely correct.

Placemaking, architecture and design, including biophilic design, can play crucial roles in tackling the contribution to the climate crisis of the built environment, which accounts for 40% of UK carbon emissions, according to the UKGBC.

As an industry, we must work together to cut this contribution as fast as we can. It has to feel different and difficult if we want to make a real change. Otherwise, as well as contributing to climate change, we risk assets being stranded as environmental considerations become more critical for investors, operators, developers and consumers.

Architects and designers are in a privileged position to influence investment decisions through our design advocacy. And as many of our clients hold and operate the buildings we design, there is an alignment between prioritising sustainability by designing for better building performance and using circular strategies once the buildings are in use, with an operator’s objective to reduce operational costs. Sustainability pays for itself over the long term.

One obvious way to set about this is to choose materials that ensure we’re not creating places with a short lifespan. Interiors should utilise sustainable design to reduce wear and tear. The University of New South Wales claims commercial interiors are ‘churned’ on average every five to seven years. Its research argues that materials such as bamboo, cotton and wool are known for their long-lasting qualities and can be used for designing sustainable interiors. Timber is also a popular choice, as the only truly sustainable construction material due to its ability to be regrown and its role as a carbon sink, according to University of Cambridge research.

Of course, no building should be designed in isolation from its surroundings. A holistic approach needs to be considered to create places that foster greenery and improve air quality and wellbeing.

Another way to create cleaner, more eco-friendly places to live is by making towns and cities car-free: a third of all UK carbon emissions come from transport (mainly road transport), according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Car emissions are also detrimental to health. Shockingly, according to the World Health Organization, more than 40 UK towns and cities are above safe air pollution limits. Local authorities are starting to recognise this. At the end of last year, York City Council announced it was planning to make the city centre car-free by 2023. Brighton has recently made a similar commitment.

Designers and architects must strive to create cleaner places through effective masterplanning and use of sustainable infrastructure. They have the tools to advocate for forward-thinking solutions to the climate crisis. As an industry, we have to recognise the physical impact of what we do and start pushing for that net-zero future.

By Trisha Hoy

Special to the Reporter

Microsoft Corp. leaders are calling the company’s new plan to address climate change, a “Moonshot,” comparable to humanity’s achievements after John F. Kennedy’s announcement that the United States would send the first man to the moon.

On Jan. 16, CEO Satya Nadella, president Brad Smith, CFO Amy Hood, and chief environmental officer Lucas Joppa announced the Redmond-based tech company’s new carbon neutral plan to reduce and eventually remove 100 percent of its carbon footprint.

“Today, we are making a commitment that by 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative. By 2050, Microsoft plans to remove the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975,” Smith said.

Microsoft’s plan to not only become carbon neutral but also carbon negative is “thrilling,” according to Lisa Graumlich, a University of Washington (UW) expert on climate change. Graumlich, dean of UW’s College of the Environment, specializes in climate change research and most recently testified before the U.S. House of Representative Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.

“Carbon neutral means that Microsoft will balance their carbon output and removal, which is great but continues to put us on the trajectory of further climate change,” Graumlich explained. “But carbon negative means that Microsoft will remove all of its historical emissions, which can really mitigate the impacts of climate change.”

Microsoft committed to a $1 billion climate innovation fund for developing new sustainable technologies for carbon reduction and removal. The company plans to reduce its emissions from 16 million metric tons to net zero across its entire business and supply chain.

Smith also announced that Microsoft signed the U.N. “Business Ambition for 1.5°C — Our Only Future,” a pledge that aims to promote sustainable science-based practices that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Three scopes

Photo courtesy of Trisha Hoy Microsoft president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith presents the tech company’s immediate plan to enact climate change initiatives by 2020 and 2021 on Jan. 16 for the climate change announcement on the company’s Redmond campus.

To help explain the scope of the company’s carbon footprint, Smith presented the statistics, which he called “carbon math.” Microsoft plans to address three different scopes of its carbon impact. Smith defined the first scope as Microsoft’s direct emissions — the trucks, commuter buses and energy used for production. The second scope refers to the carbon emitted to create the electricity that Microsoft and its data centers consume. This is the electricity that powers consumer products and carbon emitted by millions of plugged in Xboxes and Surface Pro laptops.

“I’m absolutely convinced that it’s going to take all of us empowered with technology to achieve the stable climate that we, our children and generations to come will ultimately depend upon,” said Joppa.

Microsoft plans to take necessary steps within the next five years to be a 100 percent green company starting with the first and second scopes. In July, the tech giant will start phasing in an internal carbon tax of $15 per metric ton to cover the third scope of emissions. The tax will charge the company’s own business divisions. All taxes will go toward the sustainability efforts. By July 2021, Microsoft plans to have new processes and tools both to enable their suppliers to accurately report on their emissions and incentivize them to make a difference to be more energy efficient.

Graumlich feels optimistic about Microsoft’s plan for the future because of the company’s history with establishing their internal carbon tax in 2012.

“Microsoft had a culture of managing their carbon output before other companies even thought of it,” Graumlich said. “Their internal carbon tax has held them accountable to reduce carbon use.”

Smith said, “We will ensure that by the year 2025, we will have power purchase agreements in place for 100 percent of the renewable energy we need for all of Microsoft’s data centers, our buildings, and our campuses worldwide.”

To address the third scope, Joppa also announced the creation of the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator, which provides customers using Azure, Microsoft’s public cloud services for storage and virtual networking, with more transparency. The calculator will measure and report the carbon emissions associated with the use of customers’ workloads to incentivize them toward greener solutions. Smith likened Microsoft’s customer transparency regarding its carbon footprint to nutrition labels in grocery stores.

“Shouldn’t people around the world be able to do the same thing when they’re making purchasing decisions based on an understanding of how much carbon was emitted to produce that product? Just think about what that would do to empower consumers and incentivize businesses,” said Smith.

Ongoing and future efforts

In the long-term, Microsoft has many approaches to begin the carbon removal process, including nature-based approaches, like planting more trees and new green technology. Hood explained that the $1 billion climate change fund will go toward project-based financing to accelerate technologies that Microsoft is currently developing.

“We’ll create direct air-capture technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere, for example, where air is literally run through a machine and removed from it,” Smith said.

The new pledge is just an addition to the company’s current large-scale sustainability efforts through its AI for Earth, which addresses climate equity using cloud computing services, according to Hood. AI for Earth has provided nearly 500 grants to fund sustainability projects all over the world.

Projects like SunCulture, for example, use Azure to collect information on the environment to create detailed forecasts to help smallholder farmers in Africa to maximize yields and earnings.

Graumlich explained that Microsoft’s energy saving plan benefits both communities worldwide from a farming standpoint and the company itself from a business standpoint.

“In offsetting carbon emissions, there is an increased capacity of fertile soil that can be used to create tastier crops and eventually help address hunger in communities worldwide,” she said. “Reducing their energy use also saves Microsoft a lot of money.”

As climate change continues to affect communities all over the world, Graumlich hopes Microsoft’s efforts will inspire both the government and other companies to follow suit and make larger investments in sustainability.

“It’s easy to articulate a ‘Moonshot,’” she said. “But you have to ask, ‘Does this firm have the intellectual capacity and resources to achieve it?’ I’m willing to bet on Microsoft.”

WFP aims to fight food insecurity, restore livelihoods of rural populations, eliminate isolation and inequity in South Sudan by constructing and rehabilitating trunk and feeder roads.

Road projects aim to enhance farm-to-market access in areas with agricultural potential and Improve rural connectivity to social services such as heath, education and other basic services.

How many projects are ongoing or completed?

Some 13 trunk road rehabilitation works have been completed totaling around 1,000 km of roads across the country. The Kuacjok Bridge (120m) was completed in 2019. Emergency road repairs were conducted in Maban on the Kaya - Banketa road. Currently, WFP is constructing 13.2 km of the Saura-Li Rangu road and a 14.8 km stretch of the Li Rangu- Nzara road both in Western Equatoria. The project for construction of the 48 km Torit-Magwi road in Eastern Equatoria commenced in early 2020 whilst works are ongoing on the Bor - Ayod road.

Are any other activities implemented under this programme?

WFP also repairs and constructs complementary feeder roads with community participation and conducts community sensitization, monitoring and evaluation as part of the operation. These are important to ensure that communities and authorities are informed about ongoing activities. It also allows WFP to monitor and evaluate the impact projects have in their areas of operation.

Why does WFP build roads at all?

In the past, WFP had difficulty reaching people in need of food assistance. A project started in 2004 to create access to those in need (2,600 km of trunk roads, as well as bridges and structures were repaired or maintained between 2004 and 2018).

Improved access to markets and social, health and education services increase the overall wellbeing of people. This is one way to fight food insecurity and assist the people of South Sudan to meet their own food and nutrition needs.

Improved infrastructure complements other activities such Food For Assets (FFA) and Smallholder Agriculture Market Support (SAMS).

FFA assists food-insecure communities through community-based asset creation activities including the restoration of productive capacity, community infrastructure development, natural resource management, climate change adaptation, and skills development (such as creating community access roads, vegetable gardening, tree planning, and training).

SAMS strives to connect smallholders to markets and enhance their livelihoods. Proper and reliable roads ensure that farmers have this opportunity by facilitating access.

How do you ensure road maintenance?

WFP is cooperating closely with authorities at national and state levels. This cooperation includes capacity building of national and state government staff as well as local community members, especially for maintenance works. Each feeder road project includes a maintenance programme of a duration of six months to one year after construction works have been completed.

Stakeholders (including donors, the Government and implementing partners) are consulting on a country-wide maintenance strategy to ensure roads are maintained after they have been handed over to the Government.","WFP aims to fight food insecurity, restore livelihoods of rural populations, eliminate isolation and inequity in South Sudan by constructing and rehabilitating trunk and feeder roads.

It sounds like an ambitious goal, but the term may hide loopholes that can delay real climate action and drive land grabs and hunger

Launching the 2020 UN climate summit (COP26) this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for international action to achieve global net zero emissions by 2050. A coalition of British air travel companies, Sustainable Aviation, swiftly announced plans to go net-zero carbon by mid-century.

Real action to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions is crucial if we’re to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C and avert catastrophic climate change. This means polluting economies must undergo a total transformation within ten years.

Companies stepping up to take climate action is a positive first move, but it’s important to be mindful of the approach being taken. “Net zero emissions” may sound like an ambitious goal, but the term can hide a multitude of loopholes that can delay real climate action and drive devastating land grabs and hunger in the Global South.

While the intent may seem positive, there is a deeply concerning reason the UK aviation industry can pledge a net zero target while still planning to expand Heathrow and increase overall flight numbers.

“Net zero” refers to achieving an overall balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere.

But instead of actually cutting emissions, fossil fuel companies and governments, joined by increasing numbers of multinational corporations, can use the term “net zero emissions” to evade their responsibilities and continue polluting, business as usual.

By relying on trees and unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to compensate, they can continue to pump out greenhouse gases – for decades.

Distant 2050 goals allow governments to delay real climate action for another 30 years.

It will take political bravery to really respond to the climate emergency, and ensure we can meet the goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5°C.

But this is not the only problem with net zero targets.

Most net zero goals assume that an untested technology called Bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) will be implemented and scaled up so as to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

The concept is based on burning biomass from tree plantations in power plants, then using technology to capture the resulting CO2 emissions and store carbon, most likely underground.

This amounts to crossing our fingers that as-yet-unproven technologies will somehow come good and can solve the climate problem without the need for any real system change.

But there are major technical challenges with BECCS. It is incredibly risky for governments to put the fate of the planet in the hands of a technology that might never work.

And even if BECCS does end up working effectively on a large scale, it would require vast areas of land for tree plantations, fuelling huge land grabs and hunger in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Some estimates suggest that using BECCS to stabilise global temperatures at under 2°C of warming, would require nearly 1 billion hectares of land. To put this into context, global crop production currently covers 1.5 billion hectares.

If implemented on a large enough scale to address the climate crisis, removing CO2 from the atmosphere with BECCS would end up harming poor and marginalised communities in the Global South – those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis but who are already suffering the most.

'REAL ZERO' NEEDED

ActionAid’s report Caught in the Net raised real concerns about net zero targets being used to delay climate action back in 2015.

If the term “net zero” had been defined early on to mean rapid greenhouse gas reduction to near zero, with the remainder of emissions balanced out through restoration of biodiverse ecosystems, it might have served as a useful goal to drive real transformation.

But now the term is so vague that companies and politicians can use it to disguise their lack of real action while we head towards a disastrous 3-5°C warmer world.

Already millions of people across southern and eastern Africa are facing a hunger crisis that has been exacerbated by climate change, with the worst drought the region has seen in 35 years, flooding, cyclones and a locust invasion – in which poor women and girls are among those most affected. Communities in Australia continue to be devasted by unprecedented bushfires.

As climate activist Greta Thunberg recently pointed out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, we need “real zero”, not “net zero” emissions.

The COP26 Glasgow climate talks in November this year are a crucial opportunity for leaders to convert the energy and outrage of ordinary citizens, led by young people, into bold government responses that match the scale of the climate crisis, and support those most affected.

9,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/why-net-zero-is-not-good-enough/,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Why 'net zero' is not good enough,"Launching the 2020 UN climate summit (COP26) this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for international action to achieve global net zero emissions by 2050. A coalition of British air travel companies, Sustainable Aviation, swiftly announced plans to go net-zero carbon by mid-century.

Real action to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions is crucial if we’re to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C and avert catastrophic climate change. This means polluting economies must undergo a total transformation within ten years.

Companies stepping up to take climate action is a positive first move, but it’s important to be mindful of the approach being taken. “Net zero emissions” may sound like an ambitious goal, but the term can hide a multitude of loopholes that can delay real climate action and drive devastating land grabs and hunger in the Global South.

While the intent may seem positive, there is a deeply concerning reason the UK aviation industry can pledge a net zero target while still planning to expand Heathrow and increase overall flight numbers.

“Net zero” refers to achieving an overall balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere.

But instead of actually cutting emissions, fossil fuel companies and governments, joined by increasing numbers of multinational corporations, can use the term “net zero emissions” to evade their responsibilities and continue polluting, business as usual.

By relying on trees and unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to compensate, they can continue to pump out greenhouse gases — for decades.

Distant 2050 goals allow governments to delay real climate action for another 30 years.

It will take political bravery to really respond to the climate emergency, and ensure we can meet the goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5°C.

But this is not the only problem with net zero targets.

“ By relying on trees and unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to compensate, they can continue to pump out greenhouse gases — for decades.

Most net zero goals assume that an untested technology called Bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) will be implemented and scaled up so as to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

The concept is based on burning biomass from tree plantations in power plants, then using technology to capture the resulting CO2 emissions and store carbon, most likely underground.

This amounts to crossing our fingers that as-yet-unproven technologies will somehow come good and can solve the climate problem without the need for any real system change.

But there are major technical challenges with BECCS. It is incredibly risky for governments to put the fate of the planet in the hands of a technology that might never work.

And even if BECCS does end up working effectively on a large scale, it would require vast areas of land for tree plantations, fuelling huge land grabs and hunger in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

That followed a report by BuzzFeed that Zero Hedge had shared the identity and personal information — including the email and phone number — of a Chinese researcher it claimed might know about the source of the virus.

The article, posted under the pseudonym ""Tyler Durden"" (the fictional character played by Brad Pitt in the movie ""Fight Club""), was titled ""Is This Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?"" It included a photograph of a scientist at Wuhan's Institute of Virology and suggested that anyone curious about the epidemic might want to pay him ""a visit.""

11,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deported-parents-separated-children-return-us-advocates/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",CBS News,More parents deported without their kids may be able to return to the U.S. — if advocates can find them,"Los Angeles — Cleivi's youngest daughter, Alison, would not let go of her or the blue welcome poster she made for her father, Fernando Arredondo. Her eldest girls, Keyli and Andrea, scoured the arrivals area for the best vantage point to catch the first glimpse of their father. Cleivi herself was visibly nervous.

Shortly before midnight, Fernando's group of migrant parents, lawyers and faith leaders emerged. Andrea, 14, was the first to see him, but it was 7-year-old Alison who rushed towards Fernando, yelling, ""Daddy!"" One by one, Fernando hugged his daughters before kissing a teary Cleivi and lifting Alison in the air.

""Thank you, God. Thank you, God,"" Fernando said in Spanish, raising his hands and looking upward as he embraced his family for the first time in nearly two years.

The Guatemalan family's three-year quest to live together in the safety of the U.S. finally seemed to be within reach with Fernando's arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on January 22, made possible by a court mandate and advocacy groups like Al Otro Lado. While overjoyed to be back with his family, his thoughts immediately went to the other Central American families who had suffered the same plight.

""We all deserve an opportunity in life,"" he told CBS News. ""And to all the parents who are watching us, who are separated from their children, have patience, have faith and pray a lot because miracles exist.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, believes a precedent has been established following the court decision that allowed Fernando and eight other migrant parents to make a historic return to the U.S. last month.

In his ruling last September, Judge Dana Sabraw of the U.S. District Court in San Diego said Fernando and 10 other parents could come back to the U.S. to reunite with their children and pursue their asylum cases because he found they had been unlawfully deported after being provided false information by U.S. officials or coerced into waiving their rights.

If it can prove the parents were unlawfully deported, the ACLU believes Sabraw could order the return of some of the hundreds of parents the group estimates were expelled to Mexico and Central America after being separated from their children by U.S. officials.

""If we find out they were misled or coerced into giving up their asylum rights, we will ask the judge to have them be brought back as well,"" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU's top immigration litigator, told CBS News. ""I think these nine are a test case for what may happen going forward.""

""Unreachable"" parents

In the summer of 2018, the ACLU formed a ""steering committee"" to locate and interview parents the Trump administration had deported after splitting them up from their kids. Since then, the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and the non-profit organizations Justice in Motion and Kids in Need of Defense have undertaken what Sabraw has called ""Herculean efforts"" to locate these families.

Through phone calls and on-the-ground searches, the committee located Fernando and nearly 500 other parents who were deported after being separated from their children in the spring of 2018 under Trump administration' systematic practice of separating families. Most either chose to have their children sent to them in Central America or waived their right to reunification to allow their kids to continue their asylum cases in the U.S.

In October 2019, the U.S. government revealed it had separated an additional 1,556 children from their parents between the summer of 2017 and the height of the ""zero tolerance"" policy in June 2018. Since Sabraw said these families could potentially be eligible for reunification, the steering committee has spent months tracking them down.

The committee has reached 346 parents or their attorneys. But it has been unable to reach the rest — nearly 700 — since the phone numbers provided by the administration are often stale or outdated.

The committee continues to call 386 of these parents, but it has deemed the rest ""unreachable."" Justice in Motion has led the campaign to find them, dispatching 22 team members to conduct on-the-ground searches in cities and remote villages across Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

The group has tracked down at least 113 parents, and continues to scour the region for the rest, sending 1,100 letters to addresses provided by the government and establishing hotlines for separated parents. When U.S. immigration files don't include a home address, advocates have turned to local public records.

""Defenders are using all manner of transport. Some use motorcycles, motorbikes and scooters. Some need to rent four-wheel drive vehicles, and others are going on foot or bike,"" Nan Schivone, Justice in Motion's legal director, told CBS News. ""There's a lot of effort to actually reach the community of origin, whether it is listed by the government or listed on public record documents.""

Out of the families it has reached and interviewed in their home countries, Justice in Motion said it has identified parents who are still without their children and could be eligible for the same relief Fernando and 10 other parents were granted last September. The non-profit has been referring such cases to the ACLU for future litigation.

""We're finding similar situations, for sure: Families who are still in need of protection, who suffered a due process violation at the moment of separation and in the process of seeking asylum in the U.S.,"" Schivone said.

Fernando said he wants the same opportunity for other parents because he's sure some families have endured ordeals similar to the one experienced by his family before last month's reunification.

""Mommy, they're going to kill us""

After hearing more than a dozen loud, piercing bangs that sounded like explosions, Cleivi immediately worried about her children.

""When I went outside, my son was lying on the ground,"" Cleivi told CBS News in Spanish, breaking down into tears while recounting a tragic episode from April 2017 that has become etched in her memory.

Her 17-year-old son, Marco, was gunned down outside his grandmother's home in a working-class neighborhood in the outskirts of Guatemala City. Standing next to Marco as his body was pierced by bullets was his sister, Keyli, who was getting ready to celebrate her quinceañera, a traditional Latin American rite of passage for girls commemorating their 15th birthday.

""Keyli was next to him. They were together,"" Cleivi said. ""And Keyli witnessed that.""

Cleivi's husband Fernando, then a taxi driver, raced to see his family. ""The scene was horrific when I got to my mother-in-law's house,"" Fernando later wrote in a court filing. ""Everyone was still screaming, and I saw Cleivi holding Marco in her lap. Marco was already dead.""

Two young men had shot Marco multiple times in his head and abdomen, according to a report by Guatemalan police. A photo shows Cleivi on the ground, clinging to her son's body with onlookers and police surrounding her.

""That day changed my life,"" Cleivi said. ""Drastically.""

The family is certain Marco was killed because he and his father were part of a neighborhood watch created to protect their community from gangs.

The day after Marco's burial, Fernando said two armed men warned him that they would kill the rest of his family if he continued talking to the police. ""They knew all our names, where we lived, and how to find us,"" he wrote in a court declaration.

The family said Guatemalan authorities were unable or unwilling to fully probe Marco's murder and could not ensure they would not be harmed. They left their home of 12 years and moved from place to place, but never felt safe.

Cleivi said she realized they had to leave Guatemala when a neighbor was having a birthday celebration. ""They started to set off fireworks. This girl was traumatized,"" she said, referring to Alison. ""She yelled, 'Mommy, they are going to kill us. Mommy, let's get out of here.'""

In February 2018, the family set out for the U.S. through Mexico. But two hours away from reaching the U.S. southern border, Mexican officials escorted Fernando and Andrea off the bus they were traveling in.

Cleivi said she had promised Fernando she would push forward in the event they were separated. So she continued the journey with Keyli and Alison, telling U.S. officials at a Texas border crossing in May 2018 they feared returning to Guatemala.

The family was detained together in a hielera, or icebox, what many migrants call Border Patrol holding cells where they are issued Mylar blankets and sleep on concrete floors. The conditions were particularly difficult for 5-year-old Alison. ""I grabbed a roll of toilet paper and wrapped her from head to toe, like a mummy,"" Cleivi said, remembering one sleepless night inside the cell.

Cleivi, Keyli and Alison spent three days in Border Patrol custody before being released to a local shelter. Fernando and Andrea had reached the same U.S. border crossing less than a week after the rest of the family. But the two met a different fate.

""We all pounded on the cell door""

The father and daughter were separated during the administration's ""zero tolerance"" border crackdown. ""They separated us out of nowhere,"" Andrea told CBS News, adding later, ""They took me to a place with other children. The younger kids were crying and that scared me even more.""

Border officials separated more than 2,800 migrant families before a court ruling in June 2018 brought an end to the practice. Some families, like Fernando's, were separated even after asking for asylum at an official border crossing.

Fernando said his pleas to find out why he had been separated from Andrea went unanswered. ""Around 3:00 am on the day that Andrea was taken from me, all the children who were in detention were lined up outside,"" he wrote in a court filing. ""We could see them through the window of our cell. We all pounded on the cell door, to ask what was happening. None of the officials responded to our questions.""

Andrea spent about two weeks in a government shelter in San Antonio before reuniting with her mother and sister in Los Angeles. Fernando, however, remained detained for three months and was shipped between four different detention centers in Texas and Georgia.

In Georgia, according to court filings, Fernando suffered symptoms of dengue fever and from a urinary tract infection. He lost eight pounds. Growing increasingly desperate, Fernando tried to find solace reading the Bible. ""I prayed a lot to avoid thinking about suicide,"" he wrote.

After weeks in detention, Fernando was told he had failed his ""credible fear"" interview, the first step migrants need to pass to request asylum. ""I was feeling desperately sick, psychologically and physically, and the ICE official made it very clear that there was nothing I could do to get asylum in the U.S.,"" Fernando wrote in a legal declaration. ""I did not know how long they were going to keep me in that dreadful place.""

Fearing prolonged detention, Fernando signed a document reviewed by CBS News in which he declined to request that an immigration judge review the credible fear assessment. He was deported to Guatemala in August 2018 and immediately went into hiding.

Fernando's deportation occurred roughly a month after Sabraw, the judge overseeing the main family separation case, ordered officials to reunite families and to halt the deportation of separated parents. ""Fernando was deported in violation of Judge Sabraw's own order,"" Linda Dakin-Grimm, the family's attorney, told CBS News.

""We're safe here""

While Fernando hid from the gang members who killed his son, Cleivi and her daughters found some stability. She rented a home in the predominantly Latino Florence neighborhood of Los Angeles, where the girls enrolled in local public schools.

Still, Cleivi never stopped worrying about Fernando's safety: ""A part was missing to complete our happiness."" With his return last month, Cleivi said the family's ""puzzle"" is now complete.

The family's lawyer has merged their different asylum cases into one, and their next hearing in immigration court is scheduled for July. Though there is still some uncertainty regarding the fate of their asylum petition, 7-year-old Alison is happy her family is finally living together on American soil.

""We're safe here,"" she said.","""And to all the parents who are watching us, who are separated from their children, have patience, have faith and pray a lot because miracles exist.""

Steps within the objective include installing solar panels at Kroger Co., BB #:100073 Cincinnati, OH, locations, increasing food donations, partnering with the World Wildlife Fund on wastewater education, investing $10 million in environmental innovation, updating pesticide policies to protect pollinators, launching the Peculiar Picks “ugly produce” line, piloting a mobile market to bring fresh food to underserved communities, and reducing availability of single-use plastic bags.

Kroger also standardized all of its private label food brands for simplicity’s sake and to reduce waste. Other initiatives include a redesigned milk jug to reduce plastic use and partnering with likeminded businesses to promote sustainability.

Once such venture is working with Goleta, CA- based Apeel Sciences for improving the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by adding a plant-based protective layer. Kroger began by carrying Apeel’s naturally-enhanced avocados and was testing Apeel limes and asparagus in its Cincinnati stores.

Another partnership was with TerraCycle, a waste management firm in Trenton, NJ, to use its Loop ecommerce platform. Kroger began piloting the program’s reusable packaging platform, offering consumers more than 100 products in reusable metal or glass containers.

Kroger also jumped into the hyper local fray for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The grocer paired with indoor grower, 80 Acres Farms, in the Midwest to provide fresh produce for its On the Rhine food court.

Similarly, Kroger joined forces in late 2019 with German grower Infarm to launch mini-hydroponic produce farms to produce greens and herbs within its stores, starting with two Quality Food Center (QFC) locations in Washington State.

Getting results

Kroger announced last August that it had reduced food waste by 9 percent in the first full year of its Zero Hunger/Zero Waste initiative. Among the other accomplishments was diverting 13 percent of waste from landfills; exceeding 40 percent in electric savings; and reducing the plastic resin used in its private labels by 9.1 million pounds. All represented substantial progress toward 2020 goals.

Despite all of this activity, however, some observers believe Kroger is playing catch-up with its key rivals on sustainability.

“Every retailer of consequence wants to tout how ‘sustainable’ they are, and Kroger is no exception,” says Bruce Peterson, president and founder of Peterson Insights Inc., in Bentonville, AR.

Nothing the company is doing sets it apart; instead, Peterson says, these moves keep Kroger in a position to manage potential negative publicity.

“To be perceived as ‘un-sustainable’ can have significant social consequences.”

Why Global Citizens Should Care

The UN’s Global Goals include Goal 12 for responsible consumption and production, and Goal 13 for climate action. Setting ambitious targets for countries around the world to hit net-zero emissions is a vital part of achieving these goals and tackling the climate crisis. But those targets must be twinned with the present urgency to decrease carbon emissions. Join the movement by taking environmental action action here

While Greta Thunberg watched on, the European Union (EU) has passed its long-awaited climate law that officially enshrines its 2050 net zero emissions target into law.

The “European Green Deal” passed on Wednesday, and is being celebrated by some as having unified 27 member states towards climate action.

“We are turning words into action today, to show our European citizens that we are serious about reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” Timmermans said in a press statement released on Wednesday.

“The European climate law is also a message to our international partners that this is the year to raise global ambition together, in the pursuit of our shared Paris Agreement goals,” he added. “The climate law will ensure we stay focused and disciplined, remain on the right track and are accountable for delivery.”

But activists including Thunberg have voiced exasperation that plans for the future will be akin to “surrender” unless there’s a strategy to lower emissions in the here and now.

One of the key criticisms of the new law is that, while it legislates for a long term commitment to achieve net zero by 2050, it doesn’t currently include a target to lower its carbon emissions by 2030.

That’s despite a letter sent this week from 12 EU countries to Frans Timmermans — the executive vice president-designate of the European Commission, leading the European Green Deal — urging him to lead by example and update the EU’s 2030 commitment “as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest”.

The urgency of the 2030 target is connected to a number of summits over the course of this year that have the potential to be turning points in the fight against the climate crisis.

In November, Britain is planning the largest summit it’s ever hosted, as the UN Climate Change Conference, known COP26, comes to Glasgow. It’s been hailed as the most important climate conference since the Paris Agreement — with 30,000 delegates and 200 world leaders likely to be in attendance to discuss how global climate commitments can be met or even accelerated.

And in September, just weeks before COP26, the EU-China Summit could lay the foundations to determine how successful COP26 will be. China is a crucial stakeholder in global carbon emissions — and the letter from EU countries argued that it was vital to have agreed on a 2030 target well before the EU goes to China to convince them to meet their ambition.

But the present plan will only pursue a 2030 target after a “comprehensive impact assessment” takes place. The Guardian reports that the target will likely come later than September — something that Sebastian Mang, Greenpeace EU climate policy adviser, told Global Citizen would be “too little, too late”, leaving the EU turning up to COP26 in Glasgow “empty-handed.”

“Science tells us that the emission cuts we make today and in the next decade are what will determine whether we avoid the worst of climate breakdown,” Mang said. “The EU Commission’s plan amounts to kicking the can down the road — they need to urgently update it to start tackling the climate emergency sooner, not later,” he added.

""'Net zero emissions by 2050' for the EU equals surrender.""



I have - with 33 other climate strikers from all across Europe - written an open letter to EU leaders ahead of the presentation of the proposed climate law.#EUClimateLaw@CarbonBriefhttps://t.co/kzx425gSwh — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) March 3, 2020

That call to action was backed by a further open letter from 34 youth climate activists including Greta Thunberg, published on Tuesday, that urged the EU to take its carbon budgets seriously.

“If you are to reach the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement our carbon emissions must eventually come to an end,” the letter reads. “And science tells us that process must — drastically — start today.”

Right now there's already a commitment in EU law to cut carbon emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030. Although the European Commission itself has suggested revising that figure to over 50%, that aim played no part in the passed legislation.

“Climate science says that the next 10 years will be make or break for climate action, meaning higher emissions cuts by 2030 are crucial to avoid catastrophe,” Mang continued. ”The later the EU starts making serious reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, the worse the climate impacts will become and deeper the cuts will need to be.”

“This will have a bigger impact on our economy and the lives of ordinary people, making it harder to ensure that the transition to a zero-carbon society is a fair transition,” he continued.","NewsWhy Global Citizens Should CareThe UN’s Global Goals include Goal 12 for responsible consumption and production, and Goal 13 for climate action.
But those targets must be twinned with the present urgency to decrease carbon emissions.
Join the movement by taking environmental action action hereWhile Greta Thunberg watched on, the European Union (EU) has passed its long-awaited climate law that officially enshrines its 2050 net zero emissions target into law.
The “European Green Deal” passed on Wednesday, and is being celebrated by some as having unified 27 member states towards climate action.
“If you are to reach the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement our carbon emissions must eventually come to an end,” the letter reads."

The bleak warning comes as deaths from the virus surpassed 170,000 worldwide, with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency.

Debates are raging worldwide over when and how to relax strict lockdowns.

Many leaders fear triggering another wave of infections but are also worried about the mounting economic costs and signs of social tension.

The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a “humanitarian catastrophe” with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double to 265 million this year, the UN’s World Food Programme warned.

“We are on the brink of a hunger pandemic,” WFP director David Beasley told the UN Security Council in a video conference.

“Millions of civilians living in conflict-scarred nations, including many women and children, face being pushed to the brink of starvation, with the spectre of famine a very real and dangerous possibility.”

The worst-case scenario could see famine in some three dozen countries, he added.

Freezes on whole sectors of commerce are already playing out dramatically on oil markets, where prices have crashed due to the drop-off in energy demand and a supply glut.

The United States is now the hardest-hit country with more than 42,000 people dead and 784,000 infected.

As the economic downturn starts to bite, US President Donald Trump has stoked conflict with Democratic state governors by urging a speedy return to business.

He also drew criticism for a late-night tweet announcing the US would temporarily halt immigration to the country, claiming it would save American jobs — some 22 million of which have vanished in the wake of virus shutdowns.

The vague threat was scant on details but suggested a hardening of his anti-immigration crusade, a move likely to delight supporters ahead of November elections.

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” he tweeted.

The White House did not provide any further details Tuesday about the measure or how long it would last.

Beer and bulls out

In hard-hit Europe, some countries are cautiously creeping out from confinement, though large gatherings appear to be out of the question for the forseeable future. While Germany is allowing small shops to reopen, authorities cancelled Oktoberfest, a beloved beer-swilling festival in southern Bavaria, for the first time since World War II.

Spain also announced it was scrapping its annual bull-running festival in Pamplona, a centuries-old tradition that normally draws hundreds of thousands.

In one week, children in Spain, who have been house-bound for over a month under a tight lockdown, will be allowed to accompany parents on food shopping and other sanctioned outings.

Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has also promised to soon unveil a plan to start reopening the hard-hit country. But in a sign of what lies ahead, the gradual awakening of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first emerged, remains tinged with fear about fresh outbreaks of the disease.

The industrial city was released from quarantine two weeks ago, but many restaurants, for instance, have not reopened or are still only able to offer outdoor seating and takeout.

“We have very, very few customers,” said Han, the 27-year-old owner of a soy drink stall. “Everyone is worried about asymptomatic infected people,” she said. “Business is just not as good as before.”

Singapore, meanwhile, has become a sober example of how infections may ebb and flow, with the financial hub extending lockdown measures Tuesday as it battles a second wave of contagion.

Trapped at home

Elsewhere, there is fear over how the most vulnerable will survive lockdowns that breed their own dangers.

In many parts of the world, including Latin America, weeks of confinement have seen a surge in calls to helplines for victims of domestic abuse.

Eighteen women have been killed by their partner or ex-partners during the first 20 days of Argentina’s mandatory quarantine.

Appeals to helplines have also shot up nearly 40 percent.

“Every day, a women is abused, raped or beaten at home by her partner or her ex,” said Ada Rico, from the NGO La Casa del Encuentro.

“In normal times, we would help her to file a complaint. These days, the urgency is to get her out of the house as quickly as possible.”

Misery on the continent will be compounded by a looming economic recession, which a UN body says will spike poverty rates in the worst contraction in a century.

Oil upheaval

Financial markets continued a roller-coaster ride after the price of a US oil benchmark sunk below zero for the first time on Monday, sending world equities spiralling.

With energy demand sharply down and storage options running out, many traders preferred to effectively pay someone to take the oil off their hands.

The aviation sector has also been hammered particularly hard by the global economic pause, with cash-strapped Virgin Australia announcing it had entered voluntary administration — the largest airline so far to collapse.

Health workers, meanwhile, are still working round the clock under severe physical and psychological drain.

The virus has been a major worldwide concern, infecting 3,131,659 people across the globe.

Many nations, such as Nauru, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, have reported zero cases because of their remote island geographies. Others, such as Comoros, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan are some the least populated places in the world. Geographically large but mostly empty countries like Antarctica also have reported zero cases as of Wednesday 29 April. The virus is highly contagious but mostly spreads in densely populated areas.

CORONAVIRUS has yet to infect anyone in 33 countries and territories worldwide.

Most countries around the world have reported cases of COVID-19, with 214 of them having been recognised by the United Nations as having at least one case.

Around 190 have experience local transmission, where COVID-19 spreads within the community.

Deaths from coronavirus have been recorded in at least 166 countries.

All countries in North America and the Middle East have reported cases of the virus.

The virus is highly contagious but mostly spreads in densely populated areas.

Five countries and territories say they have managed to eradicate the virus.

Greenland, Anguilla, the Caribbean islands of St Parts and Saint Lucia, and Yemen have all claimed that they have beaten infections.

Each says they do not have any currently active infections and have reported no deaths, despite previously recording cases.

Other countries say they have managed to dramatically reduce the number of new cases.

On Wednesday, China's National Health Commission reported 22 new cases on the mainland, 21 of which came from abroad.

This is a sharp decline from the hundreds and even thousands of daily new cases being tallied until early March.

Amnesty International accused the US military on Wednesday of providing “zero accountability” for civilian victims of airstrikes by its Africa command, Africom.

The rights group said its investigations into two February airstrikes that Africom claimed had killed al-Shabaab fighters showed “no evidence” the two victims killed were militants.

According to Amnesty, the victims were 18-year-old Nurto Kusow Omar Abukar, whose house was hit while she ate dinner with her family, and 53-year-old banana farmer Mohamud Salad Mohamud.

“We’ve documented case after case in the USA’s escalating air war on Somalia, where the Africom thinks it can simply smear its civilian victims as ‘terrorists’, no questions asked,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty’s east and southern Africa director.

“Not only does Africom utterly fail at its mission to report civilian casualties in Somalia, but it doesn’t seem to care about the fate of the numerous families it has completely torn apart.”

Africom’s commander, Gen Stephen Townsend, announced on Tuesday that quarterly reports would be introduced on US activities, updating any allegations of civilian casualties and detailing the status of investigations.

Africom claims to have killed several al-Shabaab fighters in two operations over the past two weeks. It said no civilians were killed, though this was disputed in local reports.

The US has already carried out 32 strikes in Somalia this year, compared with 63 in the whole of 2019.

Despite carrying out hundreds of drone strikes over more than a decade, the US has only admitted to killing two civilians in Somalia.

The monitoring group Airwars has estimated, however, that between 74 and 146 civilians have probably been killed. Local media reports suggest up to 300.

Oliver Imhof, the Somalia and Libya researcher for Airwars, said Africom’s announcement of more transparency is a “step in the right direction”.

“The issue of lack of transparency and lack of responsibility is that often local communities become nervous. Local communities not knowing who killed their loved ones causes a lot of anger and can help local extremists recruit fighters from them,” he said.

Imhof said investigations into civilian deaths can sometimes be difficult because al-Shabaab often confiscated phones from witnesses in areas they contro,l but added that discrepancies were also a result of how militaries investigate.

“Usually militaries conduct very little investigation in the field, so a lot of what they do is based on what they can see from the air. Post-strike assessments [are made] only from above, not from the ground. We often advocate for more on the ground assessments,” he said.","Faced with new allegations of killing civilians with drone strikes in Somalia, the US military has announced plans to make its operations across Africa more transparent.

The booths’ design ensures complete separation between the subject and the sampler, even down to the air they breathe.

Dozens of these units were designed and manufactured by I.M. Segev Industries in collaboration with engineering and medical personnel at Maccabi Health Services, one of the four Israeli national health-maintenance organizations.

HMO members swipe their membership card on a reader attached to the booth so that results are reported directly to their electronic health record.

After the oral sample is taken with the worker’s hands enveloped in rubber gloves attached to the unit, the gloves are disinfected. This allows a quick turnaround for the next test.

“We would be happy to share our concept with any health organization worldwide in order to support our shared mission of fighting the Covid-19 virus,” said Ran Sa’ar, CEO of Maccabi.

The Israeli Association of Manufacturers made the connection between Maccabi and I.M. Segev. Additional booths have since been manufactured by I.M. Segev for HMOs Meuhedet and Clalit.

“This is groundbreaking work in the global war against the virus,” said Dvora Hassid, head of Maccabi’s central operations.

The video below shows how the booths are constructed and installed.

IDF also makes contact-free testing booths

Until now, all of Israel’s Covid-19 testing has been carried out by Magen David Adom (MDA) in a variety of venues, including at home and at drive-through testing centers.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) Technology and Logistics Division created a mobile lab for MDA containing six testing booths similar to those created by I.M. Segev for Maccabi.

“The booths are built with negative-pressure conditions, which enables the teams to not use full protection gear and reduces the usage of gear,” a commander overseeing the project tells ISRAEL21c.

Most of the testing responsibility is now shifting to the HMOs, which led to increased demand for this innovative solution.

“Following the MDA project, a number of national health insurance providers turned to the IDF to produce similar booths for them,” the commander explains.

“We have created a single booth, mobile or fixed, according to their preference, in order to assist them and enable them to test potential patients as well. We deliver per request.”

Hugging booths

Miri Fenigson, vice president of business development I.M. Segev, a family-owned urban furniture manufacturer in Yavneh founded in 1977, tells ISRAEL21c that the phone is ringing off the hook due to international interest in the contact-free testing booths spurred by media attention in France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the US and China.

In addition, Israel’s Ministry of Defense is interested in producing its standalone units on a large scale.

Fenigson also revealed a new and heartwarming use for contact-free kiosks in the coronavirus age: “hugging booths” now under development for the national organization representing about 300 elder-care institutions.

The hugging booths will employ the same safeguards as the testing booths. Offering embraces rather than swabs, they are meant to ease loneliness for residents unable to be in physical contact with their families.","Unique Covid-19 testing kiosks in Israel let testers take samples without putting on expensive and uncomfortable personal protective equipment (PPE).

While other cities, like New Orleans, Seattle, and Detroit, have struggled or are struggling with their own dire outbreaks, no city’s toll has generated the fear, the headlines, and the human drama of New York’s battle against the fast-spreading novel coronavirus.

As of Thursday afternoon, the state of New York faced 79,017 cases, roughly a third of all the 213,144 confirmed cases in the United States, and roughly 8 percent of all of the confirmed cases in the world.

The toll of the disease has escalated rapidly, as the city has progressed from mostly business-as-usual just weeks ago to a state where businesses are shuttered, office workers largely dispersed to their apartments, and residents can walk down empty streets that normally bustle with honking cars and trucks. Times Square looks so empty it’s as if tumbleweeds could roll through at any moment.

The images of emptiness, though, belie a desperate fight taking place largely out of view inside the city’s hospitals and health care centers. Over the course of the week, the New York death toll—and pace—increased daily. Last week, a New Yorker was dying of Covid-19 every 10 minutes. By early this week, that rate had fallen to every six minutes. Then, as of Thursday, a New Yorker was being felled by the virus every 3 minutes and 15 seconds—18 an hour, 432 in one 24-hour period. Altogether, New York’s 2,373 deaths account for more than half of the country’s 4,513 deaths. And the worst, doctors and officials say, is still to come.

That unrelenting toll has overwhelmed many hospitals across the region; videos surfaced online of hospital workers loading bodies into refrigerated tractor-trailer trucks parked outside after the morgues had filled to capacity. New York and the nation beyond watched as the USNS Comfort, one of the country’s two 1,000-bed hospital ships, steamed past the Statue of Liberty on its way to help ease the health care burden in the city.

To understand what life in New York is like—both on the front lines and on the home front—WIRED spoke with medical personnel, hunkered-down office workers, Covid-19 patients, and those who have seen the disease strike down their own family. The following oral history—the third in our ongoing series, Covid Spring—has been compiled from those original interviews, as well as from social media posts, online essays, public statements, and other primary sources, to tell the story of the people of New York in their own voices.

Editor’s note: If you'd like to read previous installments: Chapter 1 of Covid Spring dealt with patients and those on the front lines of the response across the country. Chapter 2 featured the voices of eight Americans who have watched what would normally be some of the biggest and most quintessentially human moments in their lives—births, weddings, loved ones’ deaths—remade and altered forever by the virus’s shadow. Quotes have been edited, copyedited, and condensed for clarity.

I. The Medical Crisis

The view into the worst of the pandemic’s epicenter is limited, both by privacy rules and because hospitals and care facilities have been prohibiting doctors, nurses, or other health care workers from speaking to the public—sometimes threatening termination. For that reason, Jordan Culver, a doctor interviewed by WIRED, is a pseudonym. Others quoted by name below, by other news outlets, have tried to sound the public alarm at risk to their own jobs.

The WFP Centre works closely with regional and national stakeholders (governments and institutions) to expand food and nutrition security policies and programmes from a multi-sector perspective, particularly social safety net programmes that include school feeding linked to local agriculture and nutrition. Starting from the Brazilian experience in this area, the WFP Centre fosters food and nutrition security solutions for countries to deliver long-term development benefits for children and vulnerable populations in the Global South.

DEVELOPING CAPACITIES TO DELIVER ZERO HUNGER ON THE GROUND

Achieving a world without hunger is part of the global development agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by UN member states in 2015. SDG 2 sets to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. More specifically, its goals are to: end hunger, attain food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

World Hunger is on the rise. Evidence from the “The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018” report confirms this fact. The number of people who suffer from hunger has been growing since 2015, returning to levels from almost a decade ago. In absolute terms, this translates into 821 million undernourished or chronically hungry people in 2017, 1 in 9 people worldwide, with higher incidence of food insecurity in Africa and Asia. Children constitute one of the most affected groups by malnutrition. Nutrient deprivation has an immense impact on the health status of children, affecting their physical and psychosocial development, as well as impacting their future opportunities and productivity.

Stunting among children remains unacceptably high. In 2017, almost 151 million children under five (22 percent) were stunted. In Africa, the situation is particularly worrying in the sub-Saharan region, where an estimated 24 percent of the population reportedly suffered from chronic food deprivation in 2017. In addition, more than 38 million children under five are overweight.

Tackling poor nutrition contributes to stronger health in populations and their economies. The “Cost of Hunger in Africa” study, already conducted in 14 countries, indicates that economies from these nations suffer an estimated annual loss associated with child undernutrition equivalent to 1.9 percent to 16.5 percent of GDP.

Investing in human capital can build up significantly a country’s competitiveness in a fast-changing world. Developing human capital provides workforces for the more highly-skilled jobs of the future, which can push for more continued growth and renovate the direction of economies. Human capital is essential for a country´s future, in terms of people, economies, societies, and for global balance. When countries fail to invest effectively in human capital, the costs are massive, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable people.

SCHOOL FEEDING IS A KEY DRIVER OF CHILD NUTRITION AND A HIGH RETURN INVESTMENT IN A COUNTRY’S HUMAN CAPITAL AND LOCAL ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT

Research shows that school feeding is cost-effective and offers multiple and multi-sectoral benefits. School feeding programmes have important impacts in children’s education, health and nutritional status. School feeding improves vulnerable people’s food security and nutrition, and strengthens smallholder agriculture. When school feeding programmes purchase food from local markets, they have the potential to enhance farmers’ access to income-generating activities, diversify national food production, generate stabilizing impacts on local agricultural production, and contribute to local economic development. School feeding supports local capacities to withstand and recover from shocks, and boosts local economies via home-grown school feeding.","DEVELOPING CAPACITIES TO DELIVER ZERO HUNGER ON THE GROUNDAchieving a world without hunger is part of the global development agenda.

The co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the text, Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden, circulated the zero draft on 14 May 2020. They plan to convene a virtual consultation to discuss the draft on 22 May. That meeting will include a briefing from the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advisor on preparations for UN75.

We will place women and girls at the center.

The introduction to the draft declaration describes the need for a strong UN and notes that the UN presently faces “the largest global challenge in its history,” referring to the COVID-19 pandemic. It recalls that the UN was established to save future generations, and it has had many achievements: “Every day, countries, citizens, private sector and civic actors use the platform provided by the United Nations to make life better” for humanity and the planet. However, the introduction continues, the UN also has “had its moments of disappointment,” which points to the need for greater action.

The UN75 Global Conversation initiated by the UN Secretary-General in late 2019 has elicited people’s concerns and aspirations, the text notes; the UN Member States “are here to respond.” The introduction also underlines that the pandemic shows that “we are only as strong as our weakest link,” and that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity and in every country’s national interest.

The declaration then sets out twelve statements of commitment, which the co-facilitators indicate respond to views expressed by people around the world through the UN75 global conversation:

We will leave no one behind;

We will protect our planet;

We will work to ensure peace and security;

We will abide by international rules and norms;

We will place women and girls at the center;

We will build trust;

We will promote the use of new technologies for the benefit of all;

We will upgrade the United Nations;

We will ensure financing;

We will boost partnerships;

We will listen to and work with youth; and

We will be prepared.

The draft concludes that “what we agree today will affect the sustainability of our planet” and the welfare of future generations. By the text, leaders would request the Secretary-General to provide recommendations on advancing the common agenda before the end of the UN General Assembly’s 75th session (2020-2021).

By Florence Schulz for Euractiv

Germany must become carbon neutral by 2038 to avoid overshooting its carbon budget to limit global temperature rise below 2C, researchers at the independent Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) have said.

Every four years, the SRU presents a comprehensive report on the state of the country’s environment and has been doing so for almost 50 years.

On Thursday, it did it again: on almost 560 pages, the seven climate researchers of the SRU have done an all-round job which doesn’t paint a particularly good picture for Germany.

Germany is not on track with 20 of the 25 environmental goals of its own sustainability strategy, according to the report. And binding targets on water protection, air quality and climate protection are regularly missed.

“So far, the failures are too often simply accepted and targets are postponed into the future,” the researchers noted.

Germany’s environment minister Svenja Schulze (SPD) seemed open to criticism. In a video message, she said the growing warnings by environmental researchers for the past 30 years risked becoming an “oppressive ritual”.

SRU researchers have sounded the alarm with very concrete figures.

Germany is allowed to emit 6.7 billion tonnes of CO2 from 2020 if global warming of 1.75C is taken as the target, which researchers consider to be the highest possible target to stay below 2C.

But if business as usual continues, this limit would already be reached in 2029. Consequently, if emissions were to be reduced linearly, Germany would have to be climate-neutral by 2038 at the latest, they argue.

“We will only achieve this if very, very strong reductions take place from 2030 at the latest,” said climate researcher Wolfgang Lucht.

The warnings of the Advisory Council echo similar messages by climate activist Greta Thunberg. Speaking to EU environment ministers in March, the teen activist warned about the rapidly declining amount of carbon dioxide that world nations are still allowed to emit before the rise in global temperatures risks hitting dangerous levels.

However, not all politicians are ready to consider carbon budget calculations.

In a statement yesterday, the head of the conservative alliance CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Georg Nüßlein, said that “the path to greenhouse gas neutrality must not, however, be lost in the small-scale climate budget”.

Instead, he called for more market-based tools and competition, including an expanded European emissions trading system, to achieve climate goals.

Nüßlein also denounced the connections environmentalists have made between the climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, saying it testified of a “fear among some climate experts that [the climate debate] would no longer be featured in the media”.

The CDU/CSU faction led by Nüßlein has recently published a controversial position paper in which he supports the European Commission’s Green Deal, but clearly rejects increasing the 2030 climate targets to 55% of emission reduction by 2030, up from 40% now.

In the report by independent advisors, criticism has also been levelled against the Germans’ favourite means of transport, the car.

“After the corona crisis, we must think carefully about what we promote. Every car with an internal combustion engine will continue to drive around and emit pollutants for at least another ten years,” said the advisory council’s chairwoman Claudia Hornberg.

In order to make driving in cities less attractive, expensive parking fees and a nationwide uniform road toll should be introduced, while environmentally friendly transport modes should be promoted, the researchers argued.

But not all advisors agreed. Building physicist Lamia Messari-Becker said there were need for a blanket demand for less car traffic but supported the introduction of CO2 emissions trading in the transport sector, as the German climate protection law already provides for from 2021.

The German climate experts also looked to Brussels to drive further climate action.

The European Green Deal is a “very good initiative”, but big promises are not enough, warned Christian Calliess, a professor of environmental law and a member of the advisory council.

“Ambitious programmes are adopted, but when it comes to concrete implementation, they are often missed,” he added.

Calliess called for the consistent integration of climate targets into all areas of EU policy, especially in the critical sectors of agriculture, transport and fisheries. Otherwise, he warned, biodiversity could reach an irreversible tipping point.

He suggested that all EU initiatives should be subjected to a sustainability check, adding European economic policy coordination could also help in this respect. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), for example, could carry out this screening, he suggested.

According to Calliess, however, some leeway must be offered to EU member states. “The EU must not always lose itself in the minutiae,” he said.

Above all, the EU should formulate minimum standards, because one cannot “put a European corset on everything,” Calliess said. EU member states must find their own regional solutions to the climate crisis, he added.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations. (Since our previous update on VNR countries, Zimbabwe no longer appears on the list of second-time presenters).

The ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, launched during a virtual event on 5 June 2020, on World Environment Day, aims to mobilize leadership and support for a healthy, resilient, zero-carbon economic recovery that creates well-paying jobs and inclusive, sustainable growth and prevents future threats.

The campaign is led by the UNFCCC Champions for Climate Action, Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) and Nigel Topping (UK), and brings together a coalition of net zero emissions initiatives, covering 992 businesses, 449 cities, 21 regions, 505 universities, and 38 investors. These “real economy actors” join the 120 countries that are members of the Climate Ambition Alliance, a coalition of States committed to net zero emissions by 2050, representing over half of global gross domestic product (GDP) and covering nearly a quarter of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

The launch event touched on, among others: COVID-19, climate change, and the public health case for a resilient, inclusive, zero-carbon economy; new announcements, data, and plans to drive sector-level transformation; and zero carbon as the new growth and leadership agenda for cities, finance, and “real economy pioneers.”

The transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time.

According to a UNFCCC press release, prioritizing climate change and low-carbon stimulus can spur economic recovery from COVID-19 and job creation as effectively as, or better than, environmentally neutral or harmful programmes. The ‘Race to Zero’ campaign will identify the most effective pathways to zero emissions in such sectors as energy, transport, industry, food, retail, and finance.

Speaking during the campaign launch, Alok Sharma, President of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC and UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, expressed hope that COP 26 “can be a moment where the world unites behind a fairer, greener recovery from the effects of COVID-19.” COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt said that despite the health crisis, climate action must continue at all levels.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the initiative must help spur enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Maria Neira, Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health, World Health Organization (WHO), called on governments to put health and climate action at the center of recovery plans.

UN Special Envoy for Climate and Finance and adviser to the UK Government on COP 26, Mark Carney, highlighted “the greatest commercial opportunity of our time” created by transitioning to net zero. Citing the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda, he said the COP 26 Presidency and the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign will focus on reorienting investment and finance towards net zero.

From the private sector, Mark Schneider, Nestle, said building a more sustainable food system will be central to addressing climate change. Warren East, Rolls Royce, expressed confidence that engineers can help break the airline industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, and supported a gradual transition towards green technology.

The virtual launch event convened as part of the UNFCCC’s June Momentum for Climate Change. The campaign will run up to COP 26, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will now convene from 1-12 November 2021.

27,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/africa/zero-waste-farming-godfrey-nzamujo-benin-spc-intl/index.html,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,Meet Benin's zero waste farmer inspiring an agricultural movement,"(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, with just one acre of land, a couple of seeds and a bucket of hope, one Nigerian-born scientist began his quest to trample famine on his continent.

News of the drought across Africa in the early 1980s troubled Father Godfrey Nzamujo, then an expatriate priest and professor at the University of California, Irvine.

""People were dying of starvation. I couldn't stand it,"" Nzamujo told CNN.

Equipped with a microbiology PhD and his faith, he travelled back to Africa in search of a solution.

Father Godfrey Nzamujo, Founder and Director of Songhai, on his zero waste farm in Benin.

There, he found a continent ecologically rich, diverse and capable of producing food.

He believes drought wasn't the only reason for widespread hunger, and that sustainability had been left out of the equation.

Nzamujo began devising a ""zero waste"" agriculture system that would not only increase food security, but also help the environment and create jobs.

In 1985, he traded in his professor post for gardening gloves and started his sustainable farm ""Songhai"" in the West African country of Benin.

What is zero waste farming?

At the core of the idea of sustainable agriculture is designing farms that mimic the way natural ecosystems work.

""One really important piece of that is structuring farms to persist without external inputs like fossil fuels or toxic chemicals,"" said Liz Carlisle, an assistant professor in Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Those can create problems that degrade both the food system and the surrounding environment, she said.

Zero waste agriculture, a type of sustainable farming, takes these principles even further by introducing a regenerative loop, where waste in one area produces feed, fuel or nutrients for another.

""The output of one area, like the livestock production, would feed into either energy production or fertilizer for crops,"" explained Ronnie Brathwaite, a senior agriculture officer at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. ""The crop residues will be used in either energy production or livestock feeding, or even making other products.""

""Zero waste"" is a buzzword today with the spotlight on climate change . However, this type of farming is not new.

It was in place globally for millennia, until farms, especially in developing countries, moved toward synthetic fertilizer use and single crop production during the Green Revolution of the 1950s, according to Brathwaite.

During this period, growing populations generated a need to intensify the food supply quickly. Industrial agriculture created high yields, but it came with a high price, including large amounts of waste from crop production and livestock, Brathwaite explained.

""What was not taken into account was the impact on the environment and the very resources that support it, like soil and water,"" he said.

A symbol of African renaissance

Wanting to restore synergy to farms in Africa, Nzamujo started his sustainable farming mission on a small plot of land given to him by the government of Benin.

In addition to providing organic produce locally, Songhai employs 300 people daily. They harvest crops, tend to animals, oversee composting, or service the biogas digester -- which turns chicken excrement into fuel.

Nzamujo lives on the farm and constantly updates his techniques. He credits his degrees in science and engineering for Songhai's success. But he also thanks his spiritual and cultural roots, and his father -- a driving force in his life who encouraged him to pursue his studies to the highest degree and to use Songhai to share his knowledge.

Songhai has several ""eco-literacy"" development programs. They range from 18-month training courses for farmer-entrepreneurs, to shorter stays to learn techniques like irrigation. People come from all over the world to study Nzamujo's methods.

Father Godfrey Nzamujo educates a group of people on his zero waste farm in Benin.

After seeing success on his first zero waste farm, he expanded throughout Benin and western Africa.

Today, the Songhai model is implemented across the continent, including in Nigeria, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Nzamujo says they've trained more than 7,000 farmer-entrepreneurs and more than 30,000 people in total since it began.

It's not always easy to get started in sustainable farming. Beyond the educational investment, local policies and regulations also have to support this type of farming . Not every country allows crops and livestock to be grown together.

Many countries originally rejected Nzamujo's farm plans before Benin granted him some land.

Carlisle believes a key part in fostering the sustainable agriculture movement is decoupling the public sector from extractive agricultural models.

""There is a whole support system around industrial agriculture because it's been subsidized by national governments,"" she said.

However, Carlisle notes institutions are being built to support sustainable farmers.

Increasing food security

With more than 820 million people facing hunger globally, according to the UN , coupled with a rapidly increasing population , comes the need for even more food.

If there was a shift toward more sustainable farming practices, could it keep up with the demand?

Some research has shown this model, when implemented correctly, has the potential to produce almost as much as conventional farming. Both the UN and independent scientists have called for a paradigm change away from industrial agriculture to sustainable practices in order to help our planet and the food system.

""With zero waste farming, I think we're in a better position to satisfy the needs of the globe,"" Brathwaite told CNN. ""We can continue to produce similar levels of food to feed a growing population, and we have the advantage of reduction in wastage.""

Nzamujo believes zero waste agriculture is now steadily tackling the issues he set out to defeat three decades ago: hunger, unemployment and environmental degradation. And he wants to see it go further.

""Yes, it is a revolution. But it's a revolution that is not them against us,"" he said. ""It is a revolution that is inviting every people to a new way of seeing things.""","What is zero waste farming?

ZERO advances research, improves the lives of men and families, and inspires action for patients, physicians, and advocates involved in the prostate cancer cause. ZERO offers comprehensive support for millions of men with prostate cancer, including raising awareness and education for cutting edge technologies, such as the ExoDx™ Prostate (EPI) test, of interest to patients exploring all of their options to manage prostate cancer.

One in nine American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men and is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. In 2020, it is estimated that 191,930 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 33,000 men will die from the disease. Currently, nearly 3.1 million American men are living with the disease – more than the population of Chicago.

The EPI test is a urine-based genomic test that helps inform the prostate biopsy decision. This liquid biopsy test recently received coverage for the Veterans Health Administration under the General Services Administration (GSA) award, received a positive coverage decision from Medicare, and is included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for early detection in men for both initial and repeat biopsy. It is performed by Exosome Diagnostics in its CLIA, ISO, NY certified and CAP-accredited laboratory located in Waltham, Massachusetts. The EPI test is a risk assessment tool that assists physicians and their patients with determining if a prostate biopsy is needed when presented with an ambiguous PSA test result, thereby reducing complications from unnecessary and invasive procedures. ExoDx Prostate is now available with an At-Home Collection kit, enabling test access to patients unable to see a healthcare professional or preferring to collect their sample at-home.

""We are proud to partner with ZERO, an organization that through its support of prostate cancer research, diagnostics, therapeutics and patient initiatives has changed the lives of thousands of prostate cancer patients,"" said Chuck Kummeth, Bio-Techne's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""ZERO is an ideal partner to help spread the word about our ExoDx Prostate (EPI) test and educate men with indeterminate PSA scores that they can potentially avoid unnecessary biopsy procedures.""

""We are excited to join forces with Bio-Techne, an organization that aligns with our mission, values, and goals. Having a new diagnostic that can be administered at home is an exciting new development for patients who face difficult choices managing their disease, especially during this COVID-19 crisis,"" said Jamie Bearse, ZERO President & CEO.

ZERO and Exosome Diagnostics will kick off this newly formed partnership by hosting a Facebook Live broadcast on June 17th at 4:00 p.m. EDT with ZERO President & CEO, Jamie Bearse and Urology expert, Dr. Ali Kasraeian. The event will be broadcast live and will be available for replay on the ExoDx Prostate Test Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ExoDxProstateTest/) and on the Zero – The End of Prostate Cancer page (https://www.facebook.com/ZeroCancer/) and on ZERO's Youtube channel. Mr. Bearse and Dr. Kasraeian will discuss current challenges in prostate cancer management and how this is changing during the COVID-19 era where patients and their physicians are adjusting to new rules and regulations. Members will have the opportunity to address questions directly to either Dr. Kasraeian or Mr. Bearse. To see the broadcast tune in on Facebook at 4:00PM Eastern Time.

The messaging and diplomatic push for the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign launched on June 5, 2020 describes itself as an “international campaign for a healthy, resilient zero carbon recovery”, which “brings together an unprecedented coalition of net-zero emissions initiatives, covering 996 businesses, 458 cities, 24 regions, 505 universities and 36 of the biggest investors”.

This seems perilously close to the messaging around the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in 2019, which was itself built on the messaging approach of business-led movements such as the We Are Still In coalition.

This messaging for the campaign — carried out under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — seeks to emphasise the potential for non-state actors (businesses, investors, cities, and other sub-national entities) to raise climate ambition. The current campaign refers to these as ‘real economy actors’, noting they “cover just over half the gross domestic product, a quarter of global CO2 emissions and over 2.6 billion people”.

As a substitute for real ambition led by national governments — especially major polluters such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, the European Union and increasingly China — this approach tends to fall well short.

The New York Summit was noted more for youth-led protests than for true advances in climate ambition. Business coalitions are much needed, but they sometimes obfuscate more than clarify climate action.

This is particularly because net-zero is a nebulous term. Businesses often interpret it as limited to their own operations and refuse to consider the emissions impact of consumers using their products (think of a ‘zero emissions as manufactured’ vehicle, which still uses fossil fuel once sold).

They also often use ‘net-zero’ targets to increase their consumption of carbon credits or offsets which, in current form, are bad for the climate.

The leaders of this campaign — UN High-Level Climate Champions Nigel Topping (from the United Kingdom) and Gonzalo Muñoz (from Chile) are presumably not unaware of these limitations.

The same goes for the president of the 26th Conference of the Parties (Alok Sharma from the UK) and COP25 President Carolina Schmidt (from Chile), who are launching the campaign today.

Diplomatic efforts have been made to re-emphasise the role of national ambition, especially by getting 120 countries and the European Union to commit to raising the ambition in their national targets in 2020.

The list of countries omits major emitters like China, US, Australia, South Korea, and Japan. But to its credit, it includes important G20 economies like Canada, Mexico, Argentina, France, Germany, Italy and the UK, apart from the EU.

In addition, there are some minimum criteria developed by Oxford University, to maintain quality control over non-state actors’ net-zero targets. On the positive side, this includes limiting the use of carbon offsetting or credits.

Still unresolved, however, is the issue of ‘scope’ — that is, whether businesses have a responsibility to limit emissions beyond their own operations.

As a campaign, ‘Race to Zero’ represents a modest step forward in messaging. It cannot be confused for actual action comparable to the scale of the climate crisis.

This messaging needs to be leveraged to put pressure on holdout national governments to increase climate ambition.

We need to cut global emissions by 7.6 per cent each year for the next ten years, to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.

That will not happen simply by generating optimism around technology or new business practices. We will have to go beyond, using the political capital of business and other stakeholders to force new policies more in line with democratic consensus.

After all, as the campaign notes, two-thirds of those polled worldwide are in favour of prioritising climate concerns in the economic recovery from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It is past time for businesses, investors and policy to catch up.","This messaging for the campaign — carried out under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — seeks to emphasise the potential for non-state actors (businesses, investors, cities, and other sub-national entities) to raise climate ambition.

Social Share

A public servant has been given two weeks to pay half his monthly salary to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund or if not, face the possibility of being sued for defamation.

Grahame Bollers, attorney for Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves has also demanded that Kenson King, who is a prison officer at Her Majesty’s Prisons make “a full and unqualified apology” to the Prime Minister for what Bollers describes as King’s “outrageous defamation” of his client.

King was copied on a June 15, 2020 pre-action letter addressed to The Vincentian Publishing Company, which pertains to a back page story published in the Vincentian newspaper on Friday May 20, 2020, which carried the headline “Prison Officer To Sue”.

The Managing Editor and Editor of the Vincentian newspaper have also been asked to apologize to the Prime Minister in their newspaper and pay no less than $10,000 in the aggregate within two weeks, also to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund.

Bollers reminded the Vincentian that “in the High Court the Prime Minister is likely to receive $150,000 plus legal costs, if my client were to sue you”.

The story, which was written by J.P. Schwmon alleged interference by the Prime Minister in police procedure in relation to licensed gun holders.

Bollers, in his letter said: “By the said defamatory words, each of you meant and was taken to mean that my client …abused or

misused his power or authority by wrongly or improperly instructing the Police at the Colonarie Police Station to return, unjustifiably and without reasonable cause, Hanniffe King’s guns to him in a volatile situation of a domestic dispute involving Hanniffe King, his uncle and the uncle’s siblings. The clear and undoubted meaning, too, of the said defamatory words is that my client had committed the criminal offence of misbehaviour in public office, an offence punishable by imprisonment.

“In their ordinary meanings, and by clear innuendo, the said defamatory words have caused immense damage to my client’s character, reputation, official and professional standing.”

“…The simple truth is that my client never made any call to the Colonarie Police Station or to anyone at that Station about Hanniffe King or his licensed firearms. He certainly did not tell, threaten or instruct anyone at that Station or any other Station to return to Hanniffe King, his licensed firearms. The allegation is false; it is a fictitious invention; it is a fantasy!

“As responsible newspaper editors, each of you must be aware that even if Hanniffe King made or is alleged to have made the original defamatory comment about my client – which is to be seriously doubted – its repetition by Mr. Kenson King, and The Vincentian, does not turn a malicious falsehood into truth. So, neither of you nor your newspaper has any defense whatsoever to your egregious libel of my client…”

Bollers advised both editors of the Vincentian and King that his client reserves his rights in this matter should they fail to comply with “his reasonable demands”.

King’s “full and unqualified apology in terms to be agreed upon” by Bollers is to be published in Asberth News Network, which had earlier published a story on the same issue, also written by J P Schwmon.

The pre-action letter was also copied to SVG Publishers Inc., printers of the Vincentian newspaper; and to the author of the story, J P Schwmon. “They ought to be more careful in the future. For now, my client refrains from pulling any legal lever against either of them,” Bollers’ letter said.","Public servant to pay half month’s salary to Zero Hunger Trust Fund or face defamation suitSocial ShareA public servant has been given two weeks to pay half his monthly salary to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund or if not, face the possibility of being sued for defamation.

Tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.

The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa. Across the planet, the report forecasts, the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. (Flare-ups of acute hunger in the pandemic context may see this number escalate further at times.)

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. It is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Writing in the Foreword, the heads of the five agencies[i] warn that “five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030.”

The hunger numbers explained

In this edition, critical data updates for China and other populous countries[ii] have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million. Nevertheless, there has been no change in the trend. Revising the entire hunger series back to the year 2000 yields the same conclusion: after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so.

Asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). The global prevalence of undernourishment – or overall percentage of hungry people – has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. This means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.

This, in turn, hides great regional disparities: in percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. This is more than double the rate in Asia (8.3 percent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.4 percent). On current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.

The pandemic’s toll

As progress in fighting hunger stalls, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems – understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19.[iii] The setback throws into further doubt the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).

Unhealthy diets, food insecurity and malnutrition

Overcoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat – and especially what children eat – must also be nutritious. Yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families.

The report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than US$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. It puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. Nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.

The latest estimates are that a staggering 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet. In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 percent of the population – though no region, including North America and Europe, is spared. Partly as a result, the race to end malnutrition appears compromised. According to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted – too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight. Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.

A call to action

The report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.[iv]

The report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. While the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies. The study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food – including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.

The heads of the five UN agencies behind the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World declare their commitment to support this momentous shift, ensuring that it unfolds “in a sustainable way, for people and the planet.”

The Covid-19 pandemic, and the global recession caused by it, will without doubt make matters worse, the report warns, with 130 million more suffering from chronic hunger in 2020. In 2019, Asia had the highest number of hungry people (381 million), followed by Africa (250 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030. The lowest-cost healthy diet is estimated to cost, on an average, more than $1.90—which is more than the international poverty threshold—and around three billion people across the globe are unable to afford this. Rising food deprivation will exacerbate the existing problem of nutrition security.

The largest impact, both for the present as well as the future, will be of hunger amongst children—191 million children under the age of five are currently undernourished. While India saw under-5 undernutrition decline by around 60 million over the last one and a half decade, from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19, and stunting has also come down, experts fear the pandemic could erode some of this progress. The UN has pitched for clubbing direct cash transfers with in-kind transfers to ensure food security and diet diversity, though, in India’s case, it talks of the inefficiencies of the PDS and calls for reducing subsidies and redirecting these to direct cash transfer. Malnutrition, as estimated by FAO earlier, may cost nations 4-5% of their GDPs. Given how ensuring food security gets more urgent in the post-Covid-19 world, India needs to shift comprehensively to cash support, so that the vulnerable don’t fall through gaps—thanks to poor implementation, the bulk of beneficiaries of the free-grains announced under the corona relief package by the Union government were unable to receive these in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030.

by NUR HAZIQAH A MALEK/ pic by BLOOMBERG

THE global Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be the main stumbling block for the United Nations (UN) to achieve its “zero hunger” target by 2030.

The UN secretary general spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric de la Rivière said the pandemic is making things even worse than it already is, as more people are slipping into hunger this year.

“The secretary general himself said we cannot make this happen. If the current trend continues, we will not achieve the sustainable development that’s zero hunger by 2030,” he said in a daily noon press briefing on Monday.

The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry last year, 10 million more from the number reported in 2018.

The projection also shows an increase of nearly 60 million in the next five years.

The study revealed that based on the latest available global economic outlooks, preliminary projections show that the Covid-19 pandemic may add an additional 83 million to 132 million people to the ranks of the undernourished in 2020.

“Despite the reassessment of the extent of hunger in China, the majority of the world’s undernourished — 381 million — are still found in Asia.

“More than 250 million live in Africa, where the number of undernourished people is growing faster than in any other region of the world,” the report stated, adding that the burden of malnutrition is also noted as a global challenge.

“According to estimates, in 2019, 21.3% (144 million) of children under five years of age were stunted, 6.9% (47 million) wasted and 5.6% (38.3 million) overweight.

“The world is making progress, but is not on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child stunting and low birthweight. For exclusive breastfeeding, is on track only for the 2025 target. The prevalence of wasting is notably above the targets,” the report revealed.

On the other hand, adult obesity is also on the rise in all regions and if it continues to rise by 2.6% per year, it will reach 40% growth in 2025.

“Adult obesity continues to rise, from 11.8% in 2012 to 13.1% in 2016 and is not on track to reach the global target to halt the rise in adult obesity by 2025,” it added.

After factoring in sustainability considerations, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings.

“It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$1.3 trillion (RM5.55 trillion) a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset, while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions — estimated at US$1.7 trillion — could be cut by up to three-quarters,” the report said.

The UN report also highlighted that in order to ensure nutritious foods are delivered, as well as affordability of healthy diets, policies would have to be adjusted, and measures would have to be taken.

“Reducing the costs of nutritious foods and ensuring the affordability of healthy diets for everyone requires significant transformations of existing food systems worldwide, including strengthening their resilience in the face of shocks from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Given the diversity and complexity of food systems, countries will need to implement a set of context-specific policies and strategies, step up public and private sector investments with significant policy coherence, and improved planning and coordination across sectors and actors,” it said.

An urgent rebalancing of agricultural policies and incentives should start the process, as well as policy actions along food supply chains to reduce costs, and that efficiency of internal trade and marketing mechanisms are the keys to reaching the objectives.

“Raising the affordability of healthy diets requires policies that enhance employment and income-generating activities, reduce income inequality and ensure no one is left behind.

“Nutrition-sensitive social protection programmes will be particularly necessary to support the poor and those living through humanitarian crises, without basic access to sufficient nutritious food to meet dietary requirements,” the report added.","If the current trend continues, we will not achieve the sustainable development that’s zero hunger by 2030,” he said in a daily noon press briefing on Monday.
“Despite the reassessment of the extent of hunger in China, the majority of the world’s undernourished — 381 million — are still found in Asia.
“The world is making progress, but is not on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child stunting and low birthweight.

By Ashwajit Singh

Covid-19 and the ensuing global economic crisis have demonstrated that the world is unprepared for food security. The UN’s recent report ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020’ projected that the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030 will not be met. Closer home, while India’s public health challenge is by far the biggest in these times, the food insecurity hurdle has also been looming in the background, threatening to become much bigger.

To counter this, PM Narendra Modi announced the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) will be extended till November. Free grain is being distributed to ensure the poorest of the poor are not left hungry. This scheme was touted as a response against the pandemic and was supposed to cost Rs 1.7 lakh crore to the exchequer. Even though it is one of the biggest food security schemes in the world in terms of scale, a closer look needs to be paid to its implementation.

While the government has claimed that many states had requested the Centre for the scheme’s extension, data shows that 11 states have distributed less than 1% of the foodgrains they lifted from the reserves. Almost 8 lakh tonnes of foodgrains had been allocated for distribution under the scheme in March, but the states were able to distribute only 1.07 lakh tonnes of that till May. The delay has been attributed to supply chain disruptions; states like Goa and Telangana have claimed there is no one eligible to receive the foodgrains since migrant workers have moved out.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) states that the four pillars of food security are availability, access, stability and utilisation. While the government is ensuring availability, access to foodgrains and utilisation are the areas that need the government’s immediate attention.

Even though there have been vast improvements in the public distribution system, the government needs to keep improving its distribution mechanism and solutions to the existing gaps need to be found soon. The FAO recommends improved information systems and collaborating with the private sector to solve distribution problems. Inter-state collaboration and learning can be a viable solution in India’s case, too.

The food security and nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the pandemic. A disruption in accessing foodgrains might also mean that the gains India has had in its fight against malnutrition among vulnerable groups like women and children might be lost. Almost 194.4 million people in India are undernourished, according to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019 report by the FAO.

Nutrition-centric programmes like the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and mid-day meals need to keep going strong even though Anganwadi Centres and schools—the respective nodal agencies for the schemes—might not open soon. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha have responded well even during lockdown times by providing dry ration, under these schemes, from door-to-door. Other states need to replicate this.

Direct cash transfers into the accounts of eligible beneficiaries have worked in states like Rajasthan to reduce stunting, wasting and underweight among children and can be launched at the national level. The lockdown made it difficult for the established government systems to function seamlessly. It was at such a time that the efficacy of cash transfers proved to be more operational.

Another solution is the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme, under which eligible beneficiaries would be able to avail their entitled foodgrains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) from any Fair Price Shop in the country using the same ration card.

To not just deal with Covid-19, but to ensure its food security in the long-term, India would do well to expand its social protection measures to ensure the vulnerable are included in the food distribution system across all states. Another measure we need to take is to build resilience in the food system to protect it against unforeseen economic and health shocks. A vision is only as good as its implementation and monitoring—robust monitoring systems should also be designed to measure the impact of various initiatives around food security like ICDS and direct cash transfer to ensure that we continue to work towards zero hunger.

2019 Data

In 2019 Asia stood as the hungriest continent of the world with 381 million hungry people.

Africa was placed in the second position with 250 million hungry people. UN further estimates that by the end of 2030 Africa will account for more than half of the world’s hungry people.

Followed by Latin America and the Caribbean both backed third place with 48 million hungry people.

UN: Lowest-Cost Healthy Meal

On average, the lowest-cost healthy meal costs for more than $1.90 which is more than the international poverty threshold. Just because of the cost value around 3 billion people of the world are unable to afford it. Thus, worsening the situation.

UN: Hunger amongst Children

Hunger amongst children is not only a problem of the present but also for the future as children are the future of this world.

As per the report, around 191 million children below the age of 5 are hungry and malnourished. However, in India, the record of below-five undernourishment decreased down from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19 but experts fear that this pandemic may erode the progress.

The fight against poverty and ultimately its eradication within sustainable development is at the basis of the country’s development cooperation policy.

Luxembourg’s development assistance focuses on several priority areas that are in line with FAO’s mandate. They include health, water and sanitation; food security and nutrition, which are crucial for sustainable agricultural development and resilience to crises (e.g. climate change); education, with a focus on equal access for all; employability, with a special focus on women and youth; and vocational training systems. Moreover, the country’s development cooperation maintains a strong geographic focus on West Africa, especially the Sahel region (aside Laos and Nicaragua, five out of seven priority countries are in West Africa: Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Mali, the Niger and Senegal).

The Agenda 2030’s principle of “Leaving no one behind” and the commitments set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development are at the heart of the country’s general development cooperation strategy — “The Road to 2030” — which focuses on people, prosperity, planet, partnerships and peace. Through this strategy,

Luxembourg has supported FAO’s work to eradicate hunger and eliminate poverty, while promoting economic, social and environmental sustainability within agricultural and food systems.

In the period 2009–2019, Luxembourg provided a total of USD 25.1 million (EUR 22.1 million 1) in voluntary and assessed contributions to FAO. More specifically, USD 5.4 million (EUR 4.7 million) were given in voluntary contributions between 2014 and 2019 and were mainly directed towards development projects in Africa (60 percent), followed by Asia (40 percent).

Luxembourg has proven its commitment to sustainable development in a versatile manner, by supporting food and livelihood security in Afghanistan, contributing to the resilience of young people in Mali and strengthening early warning and preparedness in Senegal.

Luxembourg’s strategy presents four inter-related thematic priorities that could serve as areas of continued cooperation with FAO. They include improving access to quality basic social services, enhancing socio-economic integration of women and youth, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth, and strengthening inclusive governance.

In the years to come, FAO and Luxembourg will continue to work around common priorities, exploring new and innovative partnerships and financing mechanisms that will strengthen their delivery of the 2030 Agenda and act as a driving force to achieve sustained prosperity and a Zero Hunger world.

Belgium is a key strategic partner for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), supporting the Organization’s mandate for both humanitarian and development activities. The country is generously funding innovative and critical areas in support of food security, economic growth, employment and income generation to foster resilient and sustainable development, in addition to hosting the FAO Liaison O fce in Brussels. The strategic alignment between Belgium’s and FAO’s priorities is strong, and is the foundation of the partnership.

With agriculture as a key sector in its development cooperation agenda, Belgium places a keen focus on multiple themes at the heart of FAO’s mission: from responding to food security crises and fostering sustainable, economically viable agricultural production, to promoting commercially viable value chains and encouraging digital innovation in food security.

Discussions at the December 2018 strategic consultation echoed these commitments and helped to solidify Belgium’s and FAO’s joint vision, centred on saving lives, safeguarding livelihoods and human dignity, and building resilience against future crises.

From 2009 to 2019, Belgium totalled EUR 163 million(USD 180 million) in voluntary contributions. In the period from 2018 to 2019, the country invested in FAO’s emergency response to humanitarian crises, mainly in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Syria and Yemen along with early action in the Philippines, Madagascar and Malawi, and regional resilience activities in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. In the same period, the geographic distribution of Belgium’s contributions shows that the majority (69 percent) were directed to Africa, followed by the Near East (13 percent), interregional projects (11 percent) and Asia (7 percent). Thematically, the largest share of Belgium’s contributions during the 2018–2019 period supported FAO’s work in responding to crises and building resilient livelihoods (60 percent).

Belgium has played a fundamental role in providing flexible funding to the Organization, through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), as well as the Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism (FMM). This has allowed FAO to boost its capacity to develop more impactful ways of working, respond faster to emergencies, and promote early action to mitigate the impact of disasters. Furthermore, Belgium and FAO share a joint vision in bridging the humanitarian–development–peace nexus.

Belgium’s support has been critical to foster a stronger collaboration among the Rome-based Agencies (RBAs), also through its contributions directed to a project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) worked together on joint resilience programming as well as immediate life -saving activities.

The 2016 Framework Agreement between Belgium and FAO has provided the partnership a renewed and strengthened strategic direction. This has since been reinforced by strategic consultations such as that held in 2018, which o fered a forum for exploring common priorities for future collaboration, also with academic institutions. For example, a partnership between FAO and the University of Liège is contributing towards building resilience in African francophone communities by enhancing technical capacities and expertise to achieve Zero Hunger. The collaboration actively works on the themes of climate change and migration impacts on rural youth, One Health/ pandemic threats, sustainable energy for migratory populations, urban agriculture, and more generally in the fields of veterinary medicine and bioengineering.

The partnership with the Université Catholique de Louvain, also ongoing, is focused on strengthening capacities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change by combatting desertification, through remote-sensing dryness mapping for early warning systems of desert locust-a fected countries in Africa and Asia, and assessments, monitoring, sustainable management and restoration of dryland forests in agro -silvopastoral systems.

The strong alignment between FAO’s Strategic Framework and Belgium’s humanitarian and development strategies in agriculture, food security and nutrition — with a clear focus on digitalization for rural development, inclusion of the private sector, and the sustainable management of natural resources — provide scope for a long and ever-stronger partnership in the fight against hunger.

The year 2020 has been a time of great disruption for the world, compounded by an unprecedented global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with potentially severe economic and social impacts. In the years to come, FAO and Belgium will continue to work around common priorities to address current and emerging global challenges. Most recently, Belgium is supporting FAO in the rapid recovery of vulnerable households’ livelihoods in Mali during COVID-19 and early action to anticipate the impact of the pandemic in Haiti, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe.","The strategic alignment between Belgium’s and FAO’s priorities is strong, and is the foundation of the partnership.

The report highlights the importance for governments to hold social dialogue with the private sector and trade unions to ensure that a transition to net-zero emissions creates decent jobs and aligns with the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Jobs in a Net-zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean,’ recognizes that dependence on fossil fuel exports, current prevailing work deficits, and inequalities have made the LAC region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, similarly, to future impacts of climate change. The publication finds that the agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, waste management, tourism, and construction industries hold the potential to create decent jobs and, with adequate measures, to ensure “that those who lose out in the transition are protected and supported,” while contributing to climate action, boosting growth, tackling inequality, and advancing the SDGs.

The report acknowledges that net jobs “mask winners and losers.” While 22.5 million jobs are expected to be created in LAC’s agriculture and plant-based food production, renewable electricity, forestry, construction, and manufacturing, a just transition would eliminate 7.5 million jobs in fossil fuel electricity generation, fossil fuel extraction, and animal-based food production industries.

The report highlights the importance of retraining and on-the-job training programmes to prepare workers for the transition from carbon-intensive sectors, including gaining new skills to cope with climate change impacts. New low- and medium-skill jobs will also benefit a portion of the 66 million people in the region currently being underutilized in the labor market, including the 9 million youth who are unemployed, according to the report. The report warns, however, that 80% of the new jobs would be in male-dominated sectors, so women would not benefit from job creation “unless the current gender segregation by occupation is addressed.”

In seeking to provide a blueprint for countries to create decent jobs, the report makes a number of recommendations, including: extending social protection coverage, unemployment benefits, and access to health care; improving agricultural risk management programmes; enhancing occupational safety and health measures; and improving producers’ access to markets and integration into supply chains.

There were only three COVID-19 deaths in the entire state on Monday. Despite the progress, the governor issued a stark warning for residents to continue to take the virus seriously — and the city announced it's setting up checkpoints to inform visitors of quarantine rules.

""Our progress in New York is even better than we expected, thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""But we must protect that progress, which is why today we are adding another state to our travel advisory. We cannot go back to the hell we experienced just a few months ago — and surging infection rates across the country threaten to bring us back there — so we must all remain vigilant.""

The governor has ordered a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people traveling to New York from other states with high rates of infections. Visitors coming from 35 states are currently affected. While Delaware and Washington, D.C., were removed from the list, Rhode Island was added on Tuesday.

Several states, including neighboring New Jersey, have seen a recent uptick in cases. CBS New York asked Cuomo if he would add New Jersey to the quarantine list if the numbers kept trending up.

""I don't know how you could quarantine New Jersey... They don't fly into New York. You'd have to blockade roads, and we're not talking about blockading,"" he said. ""We're going to keep our fingers crossed and work with them to get the number down.""

On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio went further, announcing during a press briefing that checkpoints are being set up at key entry points into the city.

""Travelers coming in from those states [on the quarantine list] will be given information about the quarantine. They'll be reminded that it's required not optional. They'll be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law — and it comes with serious penalties,"" de Blasio said, adding that under certain circumstances fines could be as as high as $10,000.

""This is serious stuff,"" de Blasio said. ""If we're going to hold at this level of health and safety in the city and get better, we have to deal with the fact that the quarantine must be applied consistently to anyone who has traveled.""

In addition to the travel advisory, many other precautions remain in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. Restaurants are only allowed to offer outdoor seating and must ensure social distancing, and large gatherings are still banned.

It's a huge turnaround from early in the pandemic, when New York was the biggest hot spot in the nation. At the peak in early April, the state was reporting nearly 800 COVID-19 deaths per day.

There have been a total of at least 417,589 confirmed cases in the New York and more than 25,000 deaths, according to state health data.

Of the 70,993 coronavirus test results reported to New York State on Monday, 746 — a rate of just 1.05% — were positive, according to the governor's office.

On Sunday, Cuomo said in a statement that 6 million tests have been conducted, ""and the numbers are just about where we want them to be, which is all very good news and says that our plan is working.""

""However, context is important, and there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of new cases throughout the country and a lack of compliance here in the state, and I urge New Yorkers to stay New York Smart and local governments to properly enforce state guidance,"" he said.","New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday that New York City had no COVID-19 deaths for three straight days.

It essentially means ensuring that any human-produced carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere through technological or natural means.

19 countries and the EU have adopted a net-zero target, with deadlines ranging from 2030 to 2050.

A U.N-backed global campaign to slash climate-changing emissions has added new high-profile members to its ranks, including social media giant Facebook and Ford, the first U.S. car company to join.

The ""Race to Zero"", launched in June, brings together businesses, cities and other organisations that aim by around mid-century to cut their planet-heating emissions to net zero - meaning they produce no more emissions than they can offset through measures such as planting trees.

As New York's annual Climate Week started on Monday, the British government - host of the next U.N. climate summit - said 22 regions, 452 cities, 1,128 businesses, 549 universities and 45 major investors had now signed up for the ""Race to Zero"".

Why does 'net-zero' matter?

It may be the latest buzzword in the world of climate action but it's key to keeping us safe from harm, scientists say. The U.N. climate science panel has said that man-made carbon dioxide emissions need to fall by about 45% by 2030, from 2010 levels, and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century to give the world a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5C and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change,

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries said they would act to limit the rise in global average temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times and strive to keep it to a ceiling of 1.5C.

But the world has already heated up by about 1.1C and is currently on track for warming of at least 3C this century as emissions continue to rise. Scientists say that would bring ever-worsening extreme weather and potentially catastrophic sea level rise, making some parts of the planet uninhabitable and fuelling hunger and migration.

That - and mounting public pressure - is why a growing number of countries, companies and others are promising to cut their planet-warming emissions to net zero by 2050 or before.

What is net zero?

Achieving net zero emissions isn't the same as eliminating all emissions.

It means ensuring any human-produced carbon dioxide or other climate-changing emissions that can't be done away with are removed from the atmosphere some other way. This can be done naturally, such as by restoring forests that suck CO2 out of the air. Or it can be done using technology that can capture and store emissions from power plants and factories or directly pull CO2 from the atmosphere.

Planting more trees worldwide is a popular way to absorb and store more carbon, but technologies that do the same job are still expensive and have yet to be deployed on a large-scale. Scientists say carbon ""removals"", in any form, cannot substitute for cutting planet-heating emissions as fast as possible.

Who has committed to net-zero?

According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington-based think-tank, 19 countries and the European Union have adopted a net zero target, with deadlines ranging from 2030 to 2050. The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has already achieved its 2030 goal, though measures such as adopting renewable energy, promoting electric cars and restoring or planting forests.

Some countries, including Denmark, France, New Zealand and Britain, have enshrined their targets in law. Others are less binding.

More than 100 additional nations are considering putting in place net-zero targets, WRI says - but the fraction of global emissions covered by some form of nationally adopted net-zero targets still hovers around 10%.

Several hundred cities and more than 1,000 companies also have committed to cut their emissions to net zero in the coming decades.

How do you set a net-zero target?

WRI and the 2050 Pathways Platform - which work with governments and others on their climate commitments - say cutting emissions within national boundaries should be the first priority, with efforts to offset what remains only considered after that. Right now, countries vary in whether their net zero targets can include offsetting emissions internationally, such as by paying to protect forests in the Amazon.

To be credible, net-zero targets should cover all greenhouse gases, including methane, and all economic sectors, as well as international aviation and shipping, WRI says. Those trying to achieve net zero emissions should do so by 2050 or earlier, with the highest-emitting countries doing the most, fastest. Plans also need to be reached in consultation with those they will affect and clearly communicated, WRI said.

When it comes to companies, net zero targets vary widely in terms of which parts of supply chains - and sources of emissions - they cover, and are difficult to compare, says the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which has released guidelines to help remedy that.

Is net zero and excuse to kick action down the road?

U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa says companies, cities and others that join the ""Race to Zero"" campaign will be held to their promises, although it is unclear how that will be done.

She and other officials have called for governments to stick to an international deadline for submitting stronger climate action plans by the end of 2020.

But she has also admitted that less than half are likely to do so, as the coronavirus pandemic distracts politicians and delays U.N. climate talks.

Getting net zero targets into national plans for this decade and into day-to-day decision making is crucial, according to WRI researcher Kelly Levin, to avoid investments going into high-carbon technologies or infrastructure.

How can net-zero targets be translate into short-term practical tools? One way is by using carbon budgets, as in Britain, which place a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases the country can emit over a five-year period, Levin said.","Achieving net zero emissions isn't the same as eliminating all emissions.

An editor on the CBS News national desk was calling and directed LaGanga to drive to downtown Manhattan to shoot what, at that time, was thought to be a small plane crash at the World Trade Center.

Mark LaGanga after he shot his footage at ground zero on September 11, 2001

LaGanga, now a 60 Minutes cameraman, tried to make sense of the nightmare unfolding in front of him as he raced down Manhattan's West Side Highway. Then he turned on his camera.

Nineteen years after the September 11th terrorist attack, the footage LaGanga captured provides a remarkable firsthand account of rescue workers at ground zero moments after the two planes hit. It also gives viewers a rare look at the 29 minutes of dust, confusion, and stillness in between the time the two World Trade Center towers collapsed.

""I saw the twin towers fall""

LaGanga arrived on the scene shortly after 10 a.m. He stood on his news truck to get a better angle of the smoke billowing out of the north tower, not realizing that the south tower behind it had already fallen.

""There was so much dust and the street signs were hard to see that it never really dawned on me that one tower already came down,"" he tells 60 Minutes Overtime in the video above.

As LaGanga walked from the highway toward the base of the north tower, he interviewed passing firemen, asking the question on everyone's mind: ""What happened?""

On the street near the remaining tower, New York City looked unrecognizable, hazy and monochromatic. A thick layer of dust and soot caked every surface. LaGanga turned his camera upward to film the north tower, smoldering and stark against a bright blue sky.

Minutes later, it too would collapse. LaGanga's camera kept rolling.

""It sounded like a jet flying over,"" he says. ""That's why I panned up.""

As the building fell in on itself, people sprinted down the street, panicked. An ensuing wave of smoke and dust engulfed LaGanga's lens, and the screen turned to black. Several minutes elapsed. Finally, he coughed.

""Boy, that was close,"" a voice said in the dark.

LaGanga tells Overtime that he returned to film the rescue and recovery at ground zero for a week after the attack. Remarkably, he says he's experienced no adverse health effects as a result of his time on the site.

Since then, LaGanga has continued working as a photojournalist, most recently for ""60 Minutes.""

""At the end of the day, what we're trying to do is capture real moments,"" he says. ""So you just kind of follow and try not to get in anyone's way. But document real moments of what's going on.""

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Samuel Williams-Rodriguez confirmed this in a statement released Tuesday evening, saying, “There are currently no active cases of COVID-19 in the Cayman Islands.”

The two positive patients, reported on 19 Aug., were travellers who had recently arrived in Cayman and were subject to a 14-day isolation period. Those individuals were Cayman’s only two active cases in more than a month.

Williams-Rodriguez also reported that 105 COVID-19 tests were carried out since Monday, the date of his last report, and all were returned negative.

Cayman’s COVID-19 case total now stands at 205, of which 204 have fully recovered. Only death has been recorded due to the virus, the first person to be confirmed with COVID-19 in Cayman back in February.

That patient was an Italian cruise shipper who was taken to Health City Cayman Islands for emergency medical care off the Costa Luminosa cruise ship.

A total of 245 people remain in isolation, according to the statement, at either a government facility or in their homes, as required by the medical officer of health.

Meanwhile, international cases of the deadly virus continue to climb. The global tally for COVID-19 now stands at 25,559,850 confirmed cases and 851,781 deaths.

In 2019, the drought in the country affected more than 400,000 people in 24 municipalities in the south region of the country, leaving the population, especially women, vulnerable to food security, the official stressed.

""All of these challenges are worrying, but the concern must lead us to action. We must transform these challenges into action plans for the labor, technological and financial inclusion of rural women, which include strategies to support their families,"" she underlined.

In a world where enough food is produced to feed all of its 7.8 billion inhabitants, the program contends that this issue shouldn’t exist.

Yet the organization’s officials estimate hundreds of millions of people are starving worldwide, which makes their goal to reach zero world hunger by 2030 seem extraordinarily ambitious.

The emergence of the coronavirus — which had killed more than 1.1 million people worldwide and infected more than 44 million as of Thursday — is expected to increase the number of people needing meals by many millions. Without an additional $5 billion in funding, said Steve Taravella, World Food Program senior spokesman, the program will fall short of the world’s needs during the next six months.

“Some people are likely to die simply because we cannot reach them in time,” Taravella said.

The World Food Program, which began in the early 1960s and serves more than 80 countries, relies mainly on international government contributions. Of about $8 billion in funds last year, $3.4 billion came from the U.S.

Here is more information about the World Food Program:

Background

Established in 1961, the World Food Program began as a three-year experiment to distribute food. It served as a global emergency responder and became a permanent part of the United Nations as natural disasters and conflict ensued.

Today, the program is the world’s largest humanitarian agency, with about 18,000 staffers spread around the world. It operates in some of the world’s most war-torn areas, such as Yemen and Syria. It also partners with other local and international organizations to chip away at underlying causes of hunger. It is funded by donations from individuals, corporations and governments, and is governed by an executive board of representatives from 36 countries who set goals, create policy and oversee its activities.

Chad, Liberia, Haiti, Rwanda, Madagascar and North Korea were the countries with the worst chronic hunger from 2017 to 2019, according to the United Nations. Several other countries may fall within that category but did not report their data.

Adapting to COVID-19

The program works with each country’s health protocols without using a top-down approach in pursuing its goal of providing food aid. Its 18,000 field workers collaborate with local officials to determine each community’s specific needs. In coping with the COVID-19 pandemic this year, that has generally meant following social distancing and other precautions advised by many health authorities.

“The basic principles of infection control are the same regardless of location — keeping distant from other people, washing hands frequently, wearing masks to prevent transmission, isolating from others if one has become infected,” Taravella said. “Many settings we work in make that more difficult, but the fundamentals are the same.”

During the pandemic, World Food Program teams, for example, have worked day and night to prepack food for more than a million refugees in northern Uganda, according to a video shared by the program’s Twitter account. Some workers filled empty sacks with a few potfuls of corn buds, while others poured maize oil into empty water bottles. Cups of salt were packaged into brown paper bags. This helped refugees get in and out quicker with their groceries.

There have also been efforts by communities facing severe food needs to help control the spread of the coronavirus. In the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, about 40 women began sewing masks for their community after their clothing business slowed down. The U.N. says these women are being paid for their work by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Taravella said World Food Program workers are required to take their temperatures daily at the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp. If a fever is detected, workers self-isolate and medical officials provide further guidance. He said at least six workers — three in Yemen and one each stationed in Bangladesh, Sudan and the Dominican Republic — have died this year of COVID-19.

Program’s vision

The World Food Program has identified what it calls five steps to zero hunger:

Put the furthest behind first: “To realize the full potential of our globalized economy, national governments must expand social protection schemes for the most vulnerable.”

Pave the road from farm to market: “We must also improve rural infrastructure, particularly roads, storage and electrification, ensuring farmers’ ability to reach a wider consumer base.”



Reduce food waste: “In developed countries food is often wasted on the plate, while in developing countries it is lost during production, as crops go unused or unprocessed because of poor storage or because the farmers cannot get their goods to market.”

Encourage a sustainable variety of crops: “Today across the globe, four crops (rice, wheat, corn and soy) represent 60% of all calories consumed. Addressing the challenges of climate change, and food availability and food access, will require helping farmers explore and identify a more diverse range of crops.”

Make nutrition a priority, starting with a child’s first 1,000 days: “To prevent stunting and to promote healthy development, we must ensure that children and nursing mothers have access to the required nutritious foods.”



Caitlin Welsh, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Global Food Security Program, said inefficiencies will always afflict mammoth programs such as the World Food Program and noted it should be celebrated for undertaking a “huge challenge,” especially during the pandemic and economic recession.

“It’s the responsibility of local government to curb violence, to come together to address climate change,” Welsh said. “When we don’t see that happening, that’s when the World Food Program comes in.”","Yet the organization’s officials estimate hundreds of millions of people are starving worldwide, which makes their goal to reach zero world hunger by 2030 seem extraordinarily ambitious.

Has progress been made or are there any setbacks? Using the Global Hunger Index, the global hunger situation can be calculated and assessed.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger and undernutrition at global, regional, and national levels. It is designed to raise awareness and understanding of the fight against hunger, and call attention to those areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and where the need for additional efforts to eliminate hunger is greatest.

Global Hunger Index 2020: Progress and Setbacks

The 2020 GHI shows that while the world has made gradual progress in reducing hunger on a global scale since 2000, this progress has been too slow. Hunger persists in many countries, and in some instances, progress is even being reversed. The global level of hunger and undernutrition is at a moderate level. It has fallen from a GHI score of 29.0 points in 2000 to 18.2 points in 2020. While this is encouraging, hunger persists in many countries, and in some instances, progress is even being reversed.

Of the countries for which data relevant to all four GHI indicators are available, three countries – Chad, Timor-Leste, and Madagascar – suffer from a level of hunger that is alarming (the second highest level on the GHI scale). Based on other known data, alarming hunger levels have also been provisionally identified in another eight countries. Hunger is at serious levels in 31 countries and provisionally categorised as serious in another nine countries. For 14 countries in the moderate, serious or alarming categories, hunger and malnutrition has worsened since 2012 – driven by conflict, poverty, inequality, poor health, and climate change.

On a global level, the prevalence of undernourishment has stagnated since 2015, and the absolute number of people who are undernourished was nearly 690 million in 2020. These levels are greatest in countries in Africa South of the Sahara and South Asia. Even in some countries without hunger crises at the national level, marginalised groups and selected regions face tragically high levels of hunger and undernutrition.

While the 2020 GHI does not yet reflect the impacts of COVID-19, it shows that the situation is already worrying in many contexts and is likely to worsen in the years to come.

Failing Food Systems

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our globalised food systems, their inherent inequities, and their inadequacy to the task of achieving Zero Hunger. This year's report focuses on the threat to human, animal, and environmental health posed by these food systems.

Although the commitment to reach Zero Hunger by 2030 is a fundamental ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals, our hard-won gains are under threat or being reversed. The 2020 GHI shows that multiple countries have higher hunger levels now than in 2012, and approximately 37 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030. Additional countries, for which data were insufficient to calculate 2030 projections, may also fall short of this goal.

Achieving Zero Hunger Means Reshaping Food Systems

“The 2020 GHI findings highlight the food insecurity challenges facing low-income countries as they battle multiple crises,” write Robyn Alders, Osman Dar, Richard Kock, and Francesco Rampa of Chatham House.

The focus of their special essay for the 2020 GHI is on how to make our food systems more resilient to shocks and protect the most vulnerable using an integrated approach to health and food and nutrition security.

""At this crucial moment, we must act to reshape our food systems as fair, healthy, and environmentally friendly in order to address the current crises, prevent other health and food crises from occurring, and chart a path to Zero Hunger by 2030."" Robyn Alders, Osman Dar, Richard Kock, & Francesco Rampa Chatham House

Where are Hunger Levels the Worst?

This year’s GHI shows that many countries still require urgent attention.

Alarming levels of hunger exist in three countries, Chad, Timor-Leste, and Madagascar. Countries with incomplete data are provisionally categorised according to the GHI Severity Scale based on existing data and complementary reports.

According to this, alarming hunger has also been provisionally identified in another eight countries: Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Several of these countries are experiencing unrest or violent conflict, which affects the availability of data as well as the food and nutrition situation in the country. It is quite possible that one or more of these countries would have a higher GHI score than Chad – the country with the highest 2020 GHI score – if sufficient data were available.

It is crucial to strengthen data collection to gain a clearer picture of food and nutrition security in every country so that actions designed to eliminate hunger can be adapted to conditions on the ground.

How is the Global Hunger Index Calculated?

The countries analysed can be categorised according to whether their hunger level is extremely alarming, alarming, serious, moderate or low. The higher the value, the higher the severity of hunger in the country in question.

Food is the essence of life and the bedrock of our cultures and communities. It can be a powerful means to bring people together to grow, nourish and sustain the planet. The exceptional circumstances we have all been living in through 2020 underscores this — not only does COVID-19 pose a threat to food security and agricultural livelihoods, it compounds the threats already faced by 690 million people around the world. This World Food Day, we — the food agencies of the United Nations (UN) — pledge to work together to end hunger, eradicate food insecurity and achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2.

There is much to be done. While we can all be proud of the progress we have made — for instance, agricultural productivity has improved significantly in recent decades — yet sadly, more than two billion people globally still lack access to sufficient, nutritious and safe food. Projections show that the world is not on track to achieve zero hunger by 2030, or to meet global nutrition targets.

India has gone from being a net importer to a net exporter of food grains. This strength has been evident through the pandemic. Central and State governments were able to distribute around 23 million tonnes from India’s large domestic food grain reserves in three months (April to June) through the Public Distribution System, providing much-needed emergency assistance to families around the country. The government also successfully mobilised food rations for 820 million people from April to November 2020, including finding alternate solutions to provide food rations to 90 million schoolchildren. Throughout the national lockdown imposed in March, there were efforts to remove bottlenecks in the food supply chain due to restrictions on movements, and to ensure that agricultural activities weren’t disrupted. Thanks to these measures, agriculture grew at 3.4% during the first quarter this financial year and the area cultivated this kharif exceeded 110 million hectares. This is a major achievement.

Malnutrition, anaemia

But the focus on food during the COVID-19 containment measures has also brought out the multi-dimensionality of India’s food challenges — not least those centred around malnutrition and climate change. Even as malnutrition in India has notably declined over the past decade, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18 revealed that over 40 million children are chronically malnourished, and more than half of Indian women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. Initiatives such as the Integrated Child Development Services — which provides cooked meals and take-home rations to 100 million children under the age of six, as well as to pregnant and lactating mothers — and the mid-day meal programme, are however stellar examples of how the government is working to fix these challenges.

Climate change continues to be a real and potent threat to agrobiodiversity, which will impact everything from productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems. Though India is dealing innovatively with climate change — for example, through the development of drought and flood tolerant seed varieties, weather-based agricultural advisories, promotion of millets, and small-scale irrigation — this year, we saw how climate-related shocks made it difficult for farmers to deal with pest and locust attacks, as well as floods and cyclones. Intensified food production systems with excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable farming practices cause soil degradation, fast depletion of groundwater table and rapid loss of agro-biodiversity. These challenges multiply with an increase in fragmentation of landholdings. In India, more than 86% farmers have less than two hectares of land contributing around 60% of the total food grain production and over half the country’s fruits and vegetables.

Essay | The global text of hunger

All this points to two undeniable imperatives: the way we produce food must change through agroecology and sustainable production practices in agriculture and allied sectors; and second, we must stop the waste — one-third of the food we produce is wasted. That is why the UN, and our three agencies — the FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organisation), IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and WFP (The World Food Programme) — are committed to working with government, civil society, farmers’ organisations and the private sector to build sustainable food systems.

Supporting India

During the COVID-19-precipitated lockdown, the FAO, IFAD and the WFP worked in close coordination to support the Government of India’s Empowered Group 5 on facilitating supply chain and logistics management, so necessary items such as food and medicines were available. The agencies provided daily updates on the real-time situation on the ground, collating challenges/red flags, dynamic anecdotal data and good practices from their sources in the field. This prompted swift action in terms of resolving bottlenecks and ensured progress on addressing red flag issues.

Profile | World Food Programme, leading the global fight against hunger

What is a food system? It is a framework that includes every aspect of feeding and nourishing people: from growing, harvesting and processing to packaging, transporting, marketing and consuming food. To be sustainable, a food system must provide enough nutritious food for all without compromising feeding future generations.

As countries begin to develop and implement COVID-19 recovery plans, it is also an opportunity to adopt innovative solutions based on scientific evidence so they can build back better and make food systems more resilient and sustainable. Today, with the FAO celebrating 75 years of fighting hunger in over 130 countries, IFAD becoming the first UN agency to receive a credit rating, and the WFP being awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace this year, we are more committed — and better prepared — than ever to together develop solutions with the government, civil society and private sector.

Comment | It’s about food, nutrition and livelihood security

Working in concert

That is why this World Food Day (October 16), we call for global solidarity to help all populations, and especially the most vulnerable, to recover from the crisis, and to make food systems more resilient and robust. Everybody — governments, the private sector, civil society and local communities — has a role to play in transforming our food systems so they can withstand increasing volatility and climate shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and provide decent livelihoods for food chain workers. We must all work in concert to make sure that our food systems nourish a growing population and sustain the planet, together.

Introduction

Agriculture and its allied sectors are crucial to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by 193 countries in 2015, setting targets for 2030 and referred to as Agenda 2030. Source of both food and raw material, agriculture—crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries and forests—traces its beginnings to the birth of human civilisation. It is the world’s biggest employer and the main source of food and income, especially for the extreme poor.[1]A large majority of the population in developing countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America depend on agriculture for their livelihood.

The SDGs are interconnected in many contexts and a link with agriculture is clear for many of them. (See Table 1)

Table 1: Agriculture’s link with SDGs

SDG Link with Agriculture SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms. Everywhere As most of the poor in the developing world are dependent on agriculture, ending poverty is linked to increasing returns from agriculture. Major indicators are ownership and control over land and natural resources, both of which are essential endowments for practicing agriculture. SDG2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Directly related to sustainable agriculture SDG3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Can only be achieved through nutritious food produced via agriculture and allied sectors SDG5: Achieve Gender Equality and empower all women and girls Women play an important but largely unrecognised role in agriculture; their empowerment, decision-making and time for care work are pathways in leveraging agriculture for nutrition SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Increasing water use efficiency across sectors, integrated water resource management, and protection and restoration of water related ecosystems—all have a bearing on agriculture SDG7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Reduction in agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels and consequent pollution SDG8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Agriculture engages a large segment of the working population and consequently has a bearing on the realisation of decent work and economic growth SDG10: Reduce inequality within and among countries Disparity in asset ownership and wages in agriculture activities SDG12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Sustainable management of all natural resources, sustainable production patterns, and reducing food loss and waste SDG13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity of agriculture to the impacts of climate change, and lowering green-house gas emissions without affecting food production SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, reduction of pollution, and sustainable fish harvest. SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss All these are the feedstock for agriculture activities; indiscriminate agriculture expansion has led to decline of forest area and biodiversity loss and overexploitation of land, resulting in degradation.

Authors’ own.

Agriculture as it is practiced today in most parts of the world, is facing multiple challenges: shrinking resource base; overexploitation of land and water resources; and climate change. Further, although agriculture and its allied activities are the most important source of food as well as livelihood for many, and the link of agriculture to nutrition and health is enshrined in the SDGs, the critical contribution of agriculture to nutrition is yet to receive sufficient attention.[2] It is increasingly being recognised that reforms in agriculture are crucial to harness its potential in helping realise the SDGs. Humankind in the anthropocene era finds itself in a situation where “…agriculture and food systems are characterized by a failure to deliver food security for all, as illustrated for example by the effects of the present price volatility, which is severely restricting access to food for the poor, while simultaneously placing an increased strain on the environment.”[3] This brief draws on examples from India to examine aspects related to current practices of agriculture and their impact. It outlines the nature of change required, in order to transform agriculture into a key driver of fulfilling the SDGs.

Contemporary Agriculture: Key Challenges

Agriculture is seen as central to the challenges facing humankind in the anthropocene era, in terms of being a key driver of global environmental change. Agriculture and food production has impacts on land degradation, deforestation, loss of habitat and biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, and contamination of air, soil and water.[4],[5] Improvements in technology and productivity have led to increased production of food for a burgeoning population. However, this has come with a huge cost as shrinking traditional agriculture vis-à-vis intensive commercial farming, and expanding industrial production have led to the exploitation of available limited natural resources. The progress has often come with social and environmental costs which include land degradation, decreasing water tables, loss in biodiversity, and high emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG). The productive potential of the world’s natural resources base has been compromised, affecting the future fertility of the planet.[6] Indeed, globally, production patterns supporting prevalent dietary patterns are responsible for anywhere from 21–37 percent of total GHG emissions.[7]

The use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture causes chemical pollution of the ecosystem—such contamination may in turn lead to health consequences.[8],[9] These practices, compounded by the growing competition for land, water and energy, affect the capacity for future sustainable healthy food production.[10],[11],[12] In India, for instance, 147 million hectares (Mha) of a total land area of 329 Mha has degraded soil or has water-related issues such as dwindling surface water and unregulated groundwater extraction. Deteriorating air quality has also emerged as a major threat to human life.[13] With declining agricultural land, growing populations, increasing pressure on water and energy resources, and soaring climate variability, South Asia and other parts of the world, are facing the challenge of producing food for an increasing population—food that is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable, given the same or less resources.

Apart from the decreasing water table, farmers are directly affected by floods, droughts, rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, crop diseases and pests such as locusts. As a consequence of climate change, sea levels have risen and low-lying coastal areas are being swamped with saltwater that increases soil salinity. These salts can be dissipated by rainfall, but climate change is also increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, leading to higher use of groundwater for drinking and irrigation. This further depletes the water table and allows even more salt to seep into soil.[14]

A large, multi-site global analysis in 2014 tested the effects of rising carbon dioxide (CO 2) on zinc, iron, and protein levels in staple crops, viz. rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, field peas, and sorghum. It was found that increases in CO 2 were associated with a decrease in the range of 3 to 17 percent in protein, iron and zinc in the tested crops.[15] Researchers then examined the effect of reduced nutrient level in staple crops on human nutrition and found that projected increases in CO 2 levels could cause 175 million people (1.9 percent) to become deficient in zinc, and an additional 122 million people (1.3 percent) to become deficient in protein. With regard to iron, 1.4 billion women of child-bearing age and young children (representing 57 percent of these groups) would be at high risk for iron deficiency. This is a matter of serious concern and calls for future research to focus on breeding CO 2 tolerant crop strains, biofortification and supplementation to address nutrition deficiencies.[16]

Loss of biodiversity is another threat to agriculture, globally. Currently, only 30 crops provide 95 percent of human food-energy needs. Of these, only five– rice, wheat, maize, millet and sorghum—account for about 60 percent. Five animal species – cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chicken –account for about one-third of average daily protein consumed. This narrowing down of the food basket increases the vulnerability of agriculture and food systems and puts food security and nutrition at risk, as the natural resource base and ecosystem services are the foundation of food and agricultural systems.[17]Genetic diversity helps species adapt to changing environment conditions and confers resistance against various stress conditions. The loss of this diversity reduces the feedstock for coping with environmental challenges like increasing salinisation of soil and extreme weather conditions like drought and floods. In his commentary, Swaminathan links the Irish potato famine in the 1840s to the loss of genetic diversity and emphasises the need to “promote genetic heterogeneity.” [18]

In India, researchers are calling attention to the consequences of food being “increasingly being produced in intensive industrial settings.”[19] This includes (mis)use of antibiotics in animals and birds grown for consumption, to promote faster growth and prevent disease. The gut bacteria in the animal or bird becomes resistant and spreads through food, contact and waste, besides antibiotic residues in food and unmetabolised antibiotics in faeces. Further, increasing monoculture and loss of genetic diversity may be help viruses amplify and attain higher virulence, and lead to infectious zoonotic diseases in humans.[20]

The current imperative is to find means of producing enough and enabling everyone to have access to healthy diets without overexploiting the earth’s resources. “Therefore in the Anthropocene, humanity faces the imperative question of how to transform agriculture that feeds the world, contributes to eradicate poverty, and contributes to a stable planet.”[21]

Recommendations

At one level, humankind is still trying to grasp the severity of impact of overexploitation of natural resources in order to produce more. It is clear that prevalent high-input, resource-intensive farming systems which have led to exploitation and degradation of natural resources cannot lead to sustainability of the food systems.[22]

There is evidence, however, in pockets across the globe of various initiatives and innovations that demonstrate how things can be done differently to address or avoid these problems. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN (FAO), sustainable food and agriculture practices if adopted and practiced in the right manner, have the potential to help achieve the SDGs.[23] The following paragraphs highlight a few of the plausible innovations for reforming agriculture.

Some of the most commonly proffered recommendations for building climate resilience in agriculture include water and energy-saving irrigation, conservation agriculture, controlled environment farming, livestock grazing management, energy-efficient cold storage, and biogas production.[24]In the context of rising sea levels, in particular, India has demonstrated the potential of Joint Mangrove Management (JMM) for widespread adoption and replication(See Box 1).

Box 1: Joint Mangrove Management and sustainable fish farming

The Integrated Mangrove Restoration Programme along the Coromandel coast of India led by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) has restored over 1,500 ha of degraded mangrove wetlands over the period 1999 to 2002. Further, the Joint Mangrove Management (JMM) programme has brought together about 10,000 mangrove user families covering almost 20,000 ha of mangrove forests for restoration. The programme proved crucial especially in the aftermath of the massive Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, because mangroves serve as a buffer against such extreme events. The JMM had a two-fold objective: to restore the mangrove forests, and to ensure the participation of the local communities. The National Mangrove Action Plan of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, has cited the JMM as the best available model for mangrove management. It can be adapted widely to help overcome the challenges of sea level rise and other climate change-induced disaster events. The MSSRF also promotes Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming System (IMFFS) in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, under which mangrove plantation and aquaculture are combined. Here, the promotion of traditional canal fishing in the midst of mangrove plantation, has resulted in healthy and high harvest of fish with low external inputs. This model has demonstrated the successful culturing of sea bass, milk fish, mullet, crab and prawn, and provides a tangible option of coastal aquaculture as a source of sustainable livelihood. The pilot model covering an approximate area of 20 hectares has shown potential of generating income between INR 15,000 to 30,000 from the fish ponds within four months of operation. The set-up requires limited energy to operate, and does not use artificial feed—these result in reduced input cost and less environmental pollution. Source: MSSRF [25],[26]

There are production processes that are more efficient in promoting sustainability and should be encouraged. For instance, crop rotation where short variety leguminous crops are planted after harvest, increase the nitrogen content of the soil and make it more productive; crop waste or animal waste can be used as manure and has the potential to improve soil health; collection of rainwater via channeling and use of renewable sources of energy encourages resource-use efficiency. There are also technological innovations like hydroponic (plants grown in nutrient-rich solutions), aquaponic (using water and fish waste), and aeroponic (nutrient-rich water is sprayed onto—in air—dangling roots) techniques, for growing crops without soil.[27]

In northwest India, which was the heartland of the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, groundwater has been overexploited due to the extensive use of the rice-wheat cropping system. A study observed that improved technologies which do not require deep drainage are being adopted.[28] The benefits associated with this include less energy consumption to pump groundwater, less nutrient loss by leaching, and no groundwater pollution. Laser land leveling, alternate wetting and drying water management in rice, delayed rice transplanting, shorter duration rice varieties, zero till wheat, raised beds, and replacing rice with other crops are other practices that can help in efficient water use. Another study suggests replacing subsidy for inputs like electricity to operate tubewells, with support for output (i.e. increase in procurement price or bonus on agricultural marketable produce), would encourage farmers to use irrigation water more efficiently.[29] This is because large-scale cultivation of rice and its early transplantation in June, before the monsoon, facilitated by regular subsidised supply of electric power to tubewells may be key to the fall of Punjab’s water table.

Yet another study in India, using a process-based crop water model and data on food production and nutrient content to understand whether various crop shifting scenarios had any impact on consumptive water demand and nutrient production, found that historical growth in wheat production during the rabi (non-monsoon) season was the main driver of the country’s increased consumptive irrigation water demand and that rice is the least water-efficient cereal for the production of some of the key nutrients—iron, zinc, and fiber.[30] By replacing rice areas in each district with alternative cereals (maize, finger millet, pearl millet, sorghum) with the lowest irrigation (blue) water footprint, it will be possible to reduce irrigation or water demand by 33 percent and improve the production of protein (+1%), iron (+27%), and zinc (+13%) with only a modest reduction in calories. There is also evidence of pulses and millets being climate-smart crops, i.e., they can be grown in regions without proper irrigation.[31] They are also more nutrient-dense crops, when compared to rice.

Speaking of leveraging agriculture for nutrition, it was only towards the end of the last century that the role of agriculture in promoting better nutrition outcomes and health started getting discussed in international discourse.[32] Agriculture and its linkages to nutrition are crucial to realise SDG1 to end poverty, and SDG2 which focuses on sustainable agriculture, achieving zero hunger, and ending malnutrition in all its forms. Focus is required at different levels: increasing awareness in the population on the importance of producing and consuming nutrient-rich crops; providing support and incentives to produce nutrient-rich crops such as millets and pulses; and promoting self-consumption by growing vegetables and fruits in home gardens and on common land, whose produce can be used for consumption. There is evidence from various studies that agriculture and production diversity promotes dietary diversity, and efforts that encourage farmers to diversify their crop portfolios will help in improving diet quality. [33],[34],[35]

The imperative is for agriculture policies and programmes to move beyond its traditional focus on production and productivity, and instead mainstream the nutrition dimension. M S Swaminathan advocates an approach called ‘farming system for nutrition’ (FSN), defined as: “The introduction of agricultural remedies to the nutritional maladies prevailing in an area through mainstreaming nutritional criteria in the selection of the components of a farming system involving crops, farm animals and wherever feasible, fish.”[36]The FSN approach comprises a combination of location-specific measures including advanced crop production practices, bio-fortification, and promotion of kitchen (nutrition) gardens of fruits and vegetables, livestock and poultry development, setting up of small-scale fisheries, combined with nutrition awareness. It is an inclusive location-specific approach based on the resource endowments to address the nutritional needs of smallholder farm families, who constitute the majority of farmers. (See Box 2)

Box 2: A Farming System for Nutrition Approach

MSSRF led a study from 2013 to 2017 to examine the feasibility of a Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) approach to address undernutrition, in a cluster of villages in Koraput, Odisha and Wardha, Maharashtra, under a research programme on Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA). Both regions are characterised by small and marginal land holdings and rain-fed farming. Baseline survey revealed high levels of undernutrition and lack of dietary diversity.[37] The FSN design developed in discussion with the community focused on increasing the production and availability of nutrient-dense crops like millets and pulses; promoting nutrition gardens of fruits and all three groups of vegetables based on a seasonal calendar, at household level, on common land; and setting up demonstrations in schools, increasing access to animal foods (fishery in Koraput and poultry in Wardha) and nutrition awareness across the board. The viability of recommended crops, varieties and practices in terms of economic returns was demonstrated through on-farm trials, along the lines discussed for the case of finger millet.[38] Nutrition awareness was integral to the approach and an important aspect of this was building the capacity of members of the community to be community nutrition champions or ‘community hunger fighters (CHF)’. Using participatory action research methods, selected community representatives, both men and women, were facilitated through a process of action and reflection to help them identify, prioritise and take action to address the issues related to the importance of balanced diet and dietary diversity, food availability and sourcing of food, good dietary practices, food, nutrition and care during different stages in the life cycle.

An endline survey in late 2017 revealed increase in availability and consumption of finger millet, pulses and vegetables by households, a greater proportion of households consuming more than 70 percent of recommended allowance of all food groups, and an improvement in household dietary diversity. [39],[40]

Conclusion

It is increasingly become clear that a ‘business as usual’ approach is no longer an option if the targets set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are to be met, specifically those related to food and agriculture.

It is clear that reforms are required in the practice of agriculture. Drawing on examples from India, this brief has outlined some of the practices that have been demonstrated as means to transform the sector, arrest the overexploitation of scarce resources, and nurture sustainability.

The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a food emergency and the number of people who are food and nutrition insecure is expected to further rise in the coming years.[41] Indeed, the pandemic has exposed the fragility of current global interconnections. Given existing gaps in the health sector of the economy, supply-side issues, and prevailing inequalities, the pandemic has led to an immediate failure of desired goals under SDGs 1, 2 and 3, for millions of people who were already food-insecure, to begin with, or were rendered jobless and therefore without means to take care of their health and nutrition. In India, the breakdown of the supply chain during the initial period of the lockdown caused massive wastage of perishable foods that could have fed many.[42] Further, there were numerous lay-offs, pay cuts apart from lack of work with a complete freezing of construction activities leading to job losses for workers in the informal sector. Not only did many migrants have to walk back to their hometowns, there was no assurance of their next meal at this time. COVID-19 has aggravated the situation of large populations who were already vulnerable before the pandemic; their numbers have increased.[43],[44]

While the 2030 Agenda was already difficult to achieve even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic—with many nations like India falling behind targets—the health crisis has exacerbated the situation.

Drawing on available evidence and examples from across the world, the FAO has listed 20 integrated and interconnected actions knitting together the many dimensions of agriculture and rural development, that may be seen as comprehensively laying the foundation for resilient and sustainable societies and achieving the SDGs. [45] (See Box 3)

Box 3. FAO Recommendations for Agriculture and Rural Development

Facilitate access to productive resources, finance and services; Connect smallholders to markets Encourage diversification of production and income; Build producers’ knowledge and develop their capacities; Enhance soil health and restore land; Protect water and manage scarcity; Mainstream biodiversity conservation and protect ecosystem functions; Reduce losses, encourage reuse and recycle, and promote sustainable consumption; Empower people and fight inequalities; Promote secure tenure rights; Use social protection tools to enhance productivity and income; Improve nutrition and promote balanced diets; Prevent and protect against shocks: enhance resilience; Prepare for and respond to shocks; Address and adapt to climate change; Strengthen ecosystem resilience; Enhance policy dialogue and coordination; Strengthen innovation systems; Adapt and improve investment and finance; Strengthen the enabling environment and reform the institutional framework.

Going forward, the Food Systems Summit to be convened by the United Nations in 2021 will be an opportune time for participating member nations from across the globe to commit to the required reforms in agriculture. The period leading to it must be used by nations to rethink strategies and initiate measures to change and work for the building of resilient and sustainable communities, beginning with the transitions required in agriculture. Replicating and upscaling sustainable agriculture practices and models from across the globe will be a good first step.

53,https://foodtank.com/news/2020/10/net-zero-emissions-future-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-offers-jobs/,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Food Tank,Net-Zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean Offers Jobs – Food Tank,"A recently published report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) looks at the impact of a net-zero economy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The report, “Jobs in a net-zero emissions future in Latin America and the Caribbean,” finds that transitioning LAC to net-zero emissions has the potential to create 19 million net jobs in plant-based agriculture by 2030.

According to a previous study by the ILO, LAC will lose 2.5 million jobs from heat stress alone by 2030. Additionally, the IDB estimates that by 2050, climate change will cost the region US$110 billion annually.

The current economic system “locks societies into a high-carbon pathway [making] us more vulnerable to future climate change risks, including health crises,” Adrien Vogt-Schilb, Senior Economist at the IDB and co-author of the report, tells Food Tank. He explains that if LAC countries do not address these problems now, it will become costlier to reverse and reduce emissions later.

The report notes that over time, the transition will result in a loss of 7.5 million jobs in fossil fuel electricity, fossil fuel extraction, and animal-based food production, but create 22.5 million jobs in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, forestry, solar and wind power, manufacturing, and construction

The report outlines five pillars to achieve a decarbonized economy in LAC by 2050. It calls on the region to do the following: replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, utilize electricity for transportation, cooking and heating, expand public transportation, preserve natural carbon sinks, and reduce waste in all sectors.

According to the report, a decarbonization agenda would require a transition to sustainable plant-based agriculture. If governments create policies in consultation with farmers, there is an opportunity to improve the livelihoods and productivity of small farmers, Vogt-Schilb explains.

The report suggests governments can regulate and direct investments to help small farmers switch to high value-added crops, connect them with better infrastructure to domestic and global markets, make sure they benefit from insurance products, and incentivize farming that provides income diversification.

“A significant part of rural poverty is associated with a lack of economic opportunities,” Vogt-Schilb tells Food Tank. He continues, growth in smaller parts of the economy can provide more employment for people who live and work on small-scale farms in developing countries.

Despite these prospects, researchers found that 80 percent of jobs created would be in male-dominated sectors. The report suggests implementing new government policies that will help women and Indigenous communities to contribute to a more equitable and diverse workforce.

“Women frequently work in agriculture as family members and are thus more likely to be unpaid, or [women’s] contribution to the sector is underreported,” Ana Belen Sanchez, Green Jobs Specialist for LAC at ILO, tells Food Tank.

To provide equitable agriculture job opportunities for women in a net-zero future, Sanchez says that “giving women a voice in the decision process, at the local level and for the national strategy, is essential.”

Furthermore, the report emphasizes including Indigenous groups in the decarbonization strategy. ILO and IDB researchers highlight that inclusive and effective climate change policies must address all impacted communities.

“I hope that countries can be inspired into seeing long-term decarbonization as an economic opportunity and use that end goal as a compass – in discussion with all stakeholders,” Vogt-Schilb tells Food Tank. “Co-construction is key to ensure all sustainable development goals are considered and that challenges on the road are identified and addressed.”

India seeks global food supply champion role amidst pandemic – but may need to save its poor first,"India has been actively seeking a position as a global food security ‘hero’ of sorts during COVID-19, including pushing for ‘barrier free’ produce exports even through its own lockdown, and claiming that it has ‘no issues’​ with local food supply.

“Contrary to steps taken by some other countries during this difficult pandemic period, India did not place any restrictions on exports of farm produce,”​ Trade Promotion Council of India Chairman Mohit Singla told FoodNavigator-Asia​.

“In fact, the government has been taking requisite steps to ensure barrier free exports of surplus produce right from the first lockdown.​

“India had commenced exports of rice, meat, dairy and processed food items in the initial days of April 2020 [and] export of agricultural commodities surged by 23% during March-June, 2020.”​

He added that due to this stability in local food security, the main focus for the country at present is to expand global food trade.

“Due to its rich resource base and availability of sufficient surplus of essential food items, India does not face any issues with respect to domestic food supply,”​ Singla stressed.

“T​he priority is to sustainably grow India’s contribution to global agricultural trade in terms of commodities as well as processed food products - This will help boost farmer incomes in line with policy objectives as well as contribute to supply stability in the global market, particularly in the pandemic period.”​

Indian government officials have also made promises on a global platform to ‘ensuring a stable global food supply’​ through its agri-export policies, again assuring all who will listen that the country has enough food to provide for itself and others.

“[The] Indian government has taken prompt measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic which coincided with [winter] harvesting,”​ India Agriculture Ministry additional secretary Alka Bhargava told countries attending the UN FAO’s 35th Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC), according to an official statement.

The country’s Agriculture Commissioner S K Malhotra also emphasised that India had achieved ‘record’​ grain production and ‘successfully controlled’​ the recent pest attacks by locusts​ and armyworms, and would support in.

That said, the UN FAO also highlighted at the conference that the APAC region contains over half of the world’s undernourished people, with South Asia in particular expected to see a rapid rise of about a third to 330 million by 2030 in light of COVID-19 – and India is likely to contribute to a very large proportion of this, despite all its promises.

According to UN data, India has nearly 195 million people who are undernourished and one of the world’s highest child undernutrition rates, taking roughly a quarter of the global hunger burden.

“Nearly 47 million or 4 out of 10 children in India are not meeting their full human potential because of chronic undernutrition or stunting,”​ said the UN on its website.

“This has [long-term lifetime] consequences such​ as diminished learning capacity, poor school performance, reduced earnings and increased risks of chronic diseases. The impacts are multi-generational as malnourished girls and women often give birth to low birth-weight infants too.”​

Malnourishment in India​

Perhaps even more worrying is that despite India’s claims to have achieved food security, the majority of its population may be able to afford an ‘energy-sufficient’ diet, but less than 25% can actually afford a ‘healthy’ diet.

According to a recent international report by the UN FAO, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020,​ 99.1% of the Indian population can currently a basic diet that can just meet calorie needs, but only 22.1% can afford a healthy diet containing the ‘recommended intake of more diversified and desirable food groups’​.

Some 60.9% of the population was found to be able to afford a ‘nutrient adequate’ but still not healthy, diet.

“The health impacts associated with poor diet quality are significant – [these are] a principal contributor to malnutrition [and] are significant risk factors for non-communicable diseases,”​ said the researchers.

In addition, although India is trying to combat malnourishment via large-scale programmes related to food security and poverty such as giving out free food rations​ during the COVID-19 lockdown, not only are these blighted by operational inefficiencies as confirmed by government data, but there tend to be ‘critical gaps’​, according to the UN.

“[The] critical gaps [are] in terms of inclusion and exclusion errors - Women and girls are particularly disadvantaged,”​ said the agency.

This was echoed by the FAO researchers which highlighted what was called ‘efficiency ​problems’ with India’s food distribution programme.

“[India’s] Targeted Public Distribution System represents the largest social protection programme in the world, reaching 800 million people with subsidised cereals that can be purchased from more than 500 000 fair price shops across the country,”​ they said.

“[However, some studies have] found that the programme still faces efficiency problems, particularly in regard to targeting food insecure and poor population groups, [even if there has been] some positive impact on the intake of macronutrients.​

Worse yet, agricultural and policy challenges are also coming to the fore despite the country’s ‘record’ production season, which shine may soon fade if these are not addressed soon.

“In India, policies that [are biased towards] staple crop production, such as fertilizer and credit subsidies, price supports and irrigation infrastructure (particularly for rice), have tended to discourage the production of traditional non-staple crops, such as pulses and legumes,”​ said the researchers.

“[This situation has] limited the supply responsiveness of vegetables and other non-staple foods. [Policies should specifically target] strengthened capacity for all-season vegetable production, and other high-value commodities to increase availability of nutritious foods.”​

The UN added that some major agricultural challenges looming for India include slowing agriculture growth, climate change, land degradation due to imbalanced fertiliser use and shrinking bio-diversity.","India has been actively seeking a position as a global food security ‘hero’ of sorts during COVID-19, including pushing for ‘barrier free’ produce exports even through its own lockdown, and claiming that it has ‘no issues’​ with local food supply.

Credit: OceanForesters As humanity struggles to limit ever-rising temperatures, it also seeks to address growing poverty, disease and hunger across the world. Our team has designed an approach to address both issues in a way that is practical, economical, and effective, relying on three newly demonstrated technologies.

The world faces multiple crises affecting basic human needs for food, shelter and health, while at the same time maintaining aspirations for education and meaningful work. Crises affecting food and shelter, such as droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, diminished glaciers/snowpack and sea-level rise are exacerbated by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Health issues such as pandemics and increasing ranges of disease-transmitting organisms are also intensified by climate change.

Human needs and climate crises require finding interconnected opportunities addressing these interrelated challenges. Indeed, Pope Francis has issued a call to ""...bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development…"" The 2015 Paris Agreement recommends ""rapid reductions"" of greenhouse gases be achieved ""on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.""

Our team found interconnected opportunities with two approaches addressing human and climate issues. The two approaches update our 2012 proposal to grow more seaweed to simultaneously solve the problems of feeding the world, fueling the world and reversing climate change. We discovered these approaches during our work on the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) MARINER Program. The program's goal was to reduce the cost of growing macroalgae for biofuel.

Figure 1 shows how wastes, biomass, and fossil fuels are employed by the three newly demonstrated technologies: (1) building floating flexible fishing reef ecosystems with nutrient recycling achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, such as producing a half-billion tonnes of seafood per year; (2) Allam-Fetvedt Cycle (Allam Cycle) power plants efficiently producing both electricity and sequestration-ready CO 2 ; and (3) advances in hydrothermal liquefaction transforming any type of biomass into high quality biocrude oil.

During our MARINER work, we found that growing shellfish and fish close to seaweed improves the growth and potential yield of all three. In fact, farming annual mono-crops, or even dual-crops, in the ocean is sub-optimal. The best seaweed productivity is a perennial crop as part of a complete ecosystem that is managed as forests are managed. Perhaps as many as 30 species of fish, shellfish, crustaceans and others can be harvested, leaving the 100 ecosystem-supporting species. It's best to harvest a little macroalgae every week or so (as opposed to one to three harvests per year).

The permanent artificial reefs can be placed at any seafloor depth while floating at the ideal depth for the seaweed species. With ideal depth for sunlight and nutrient recycling, each reef can be even more productive than are natural reefs. This Total Ecosystem Aquaculture is a proposed program for the U.N. Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).

Co-author Antoine de Ramon N'Yeurt, a senior marine biologist at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji, has investigated marine ecosystems across many tropical islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. He says, ""I have looked at the productivity and biodiversity of natural coral reefs and I realize that artificial seaweed reefs could be even more productive and thriving ecosystems. A scientifically designed mixture of seaweed and shellfish would uptake excess nutrients while attracting sustainable eco-communities of fish, crustaceans, sea cucumbers and their myriad associated microbial communities. This system could restore fishing jobs and natural habitat, helping island and coastal nations throughout the world not only to feed themselves, but export food to help feed humanity.""

Allam cycle electrical plants make electricity with zero emissions whether burning coal or biofuels, allowing no gases to escape. The result could be the ending of dangerous pollution from power plants, yielding great health benefits while capturing all the carbon dioxide for sequestration. And if they burn trash, plastic, crop residues or other dry biofuels, the process is carbon negative, resulting in high net carbon removal. The company 8 Rivers currently has a working plant in Texas demonstrating that the technology is ready for commercialization.

Then we looked at the World Bank analysis of the 2 billion tons of waste generated by humanity every year. We saw that only a small fraction is recycled; most is either dumped in landfills, which emit climate-harming methane, or dumped in trash heaps that often catch fire, emitting dangerous air pollution. Too much waste, especially plastic, finds its way into the ocean, harming turtles, fish and birds. The economics of hydrothermal liquefaction (see page 13 in our paper and pages 22-27 in our Supplemental Material) have improved to support commercial-scale conversion of organic wastes, mixed with some plastics, into high quality biocrude oil. The biocrude oil can replace bunker fuel or be refined to make biodiesel and bio-gasoline at prices comparable to fossil fuels by applying the waste disposal fees to the production costs. By the time waste is fully used, the process economics should support using purpose-grown macroalgae.

Our analysis found that the world could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, even with substantial fossil fuel use. In fact, a tax on fossil fuels could be used to pay for removing the trillions of tonnes of previously emitted CO 2 . The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 degrees C report projects nearly 3 trillion excess tonnes of CO 2 in the atmosphere and oceans (see the right side of Figure 2) if net zero emissions are achieved by 2050.

We put all this analysis into an Excel spreadsheet with 24 interlinked tabs that estimate the amount of waste and biomass of many kinds available globally. Combined with the three technologies and the estimated demand for energy, we were able to calculate how to remove all of the excess CO 2 . Removing excess CO 2 will bring global air and water temperatures and ocean pH back to pre-industrial levels. Climates and ocean currents will more slowly stabilize and eventually return to pre-industrial conditions. Many species extinctions will be avoided.

Our spreadsheet (Supplemental Material in the zip document) allows countries and communities to choose a suitable balance using variations of low bio-electricity and high biofuels (for current vehicles) or high bio-electricity and low biofuels (to supply electric vehicles). The spreadsheet is designed so anyone can plug in estimates for their region and see the outcomes in terms of quantities, costs, and carbon sequestration amounts.

Figure 2: Our paper’s calculations superimposed on the IPCC 1.5ºC projections. Both our low and high bio-electricity alternatives show much more carbon removal than the IPCC each year in order to return CO2 levels to pre-industrial levels of about 300 ppm.

Tignor, and T. Waterfield (eds.)]

Figure 2 graphs possible emissions from both our approaches. Allam Cycle plants are only economical with dry fuels, such as trash, plastic, and crop residues. Some islands do not have sufficient quantities of dry biomass, but have access to Total Ecosystem Aquaculture reefs that could grow abundant seaweed biofuel that could make oil in hydrothermal liquefaction plants.

ARPA-E required us to have a path to market for our macroalgae-grow-harvest technology. That requirement inspired us to phase the three technologies for a path to full scale. We suggest roughly this order:

Grow up to 500 million tonnes/yr of seafood worth about $1 trillion/yr on permanent flexible floating reefs. While growing seafood, refine equipment for growing macroalgae for biofuel. Produce 20 million barrels/day of biofuel from solid waste worth $0.3-0.7 trillion/yr. While processing trash, refine the process to use purpose-grown macroalgae economically. Scale to produce more biocrude oil from macroalgae than current fossil oil. Scale up to sequestration of 28 to 38 billion tonnes/yr of CO 2 , which could restore pre-industrial CO 2 levels by 2140-2170. At full scale, our carbon dioxide removal costs are projected at $26 per tonne of CO 2 . That is less than one-third of cost estimates for bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration with pre-2019 technology or the projected cost of direct air-capture removal.

The climate window of opportunity is rapidly closing. Action is needed now. Starting on our path to scale appears immediately economically viable, even without a carbon fee/tax.

We look forward to ongoing dialogues with scientists, engineers, political decisionmakers and communities to ""bring the whole human family together"" with ""sustainable and integral development."" The more perspectives, the better. For action opportunities involving the ocean, please participate in the U.N. Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Calls grew for India to impose a nationwide lockdown as new coronavirus cases and deaths held close to record highs on Monday, increasing pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths reported by the health ministry were off a little from recent peaks, taking India’s tally to 22.66 million with 246,116 deaths.

As many hospitals grapple with an acute shortage of oxygen and beds while morgues and crematoriums overflow, experts have said India’s actual figures could be far higher than reported.

Sunday’s 1.47 million tests for COVID-19 were this month’s lowest yet, data from the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research showed. The figure compared with a daily average of 1.7 million for the first eight days of May.

The number of positive results from the tests was not immediately clear, however.

Many states have imposed strict lockdowns over the last month while others have placed curbs on movement and shut cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls.

But pressure is mounting on Modi to announce a nationwide lockdown as he did during the first wave of infections last year.

He is battling criticism for allowing huge gatherings at a religious festival and holding large election rallies during the past two months even as cases surged.

“A failure of governance of epic and historic proportions,” Vipin Narang, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, said on Twitter.

On Sunday, top White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said he had advised Indian authorities they needed to shut down.

“You’ve got to shut down,” Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week” television show. “I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down.”

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also called for a “complete, well-planned, pre-announced” lockdown.

New Delhi, the capital, entered a fourth week of lockdown, with tougher curbs such as the shutdown of the suburban rail network, while residents scrambled for scarce hospital beds and oxygen supplies.

“This is not the time to be lenient,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday.

NAMIBIANS must find new and creative ways to collectively tackle the scourge of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.

President Hage Geingob met with representatives of the #Shutitalldown protest movement at State House and gave the reassurance that their goals were achievable and that fighting against the scourge of gender-based violence was not only their struggle but also a collective struggle.

The President reminded the representatives of the movement that it was essential for them to express themselves in a democracy.

“It is a manifestation of hope that things will change and that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Your willingness to attend the meeting is an illustration of the trust you put in the elected Government,” he said.

Geingob underlined the importance of buttressing the rule of law, including processes, systems, and institutions in the Namibian Governance Architecture.

“It was an opportune moment to meet with the petitioners following the processes of petitioning they had followed with the Prime Minister, including the statement by the Prime Minister in the National Assembly on 13 October 2020 dealing with the concerns of the youth,” he said.

The President expressed satisfaction with the fact that the Prime Minister dealt with the issues in the petition and further emphasized that alcohol abuse could not be used as an excuse anymore and the nation needed to look at rebuilding the family unit that has been broken.

While addressing the representatives, Dr. Geingob stressed that has zero-tolerance for SGBV and said that the elevation of the Gender affairs to the Presidency is in itself ample demonstration of the commitment he places on gender equality, including the plight of women and children.

“It would be wrong to assume that we are at war against each other, we have to address this issue together. Gender-Based Violence is something we have to address together as a nation”, he said.

Geingob also stressed the need for solidarity in fighting the shared challenge of Gender-Based Violence and said that urgency exists to build safer communities.

“Misunderstandings could occur when people don’t talk to each other. Countries go to war when diplomacy fails and when you don’t communicate. Dialogue and unity is the key,” the President cautioned.

Geingob also highlighted the importance of “disagreeing without being disagreeable” and finding one another through dialogue and he further assured the youth leaders that communication in Government will be strengthened to share actions and policies in place to strengthen the fight against Gender-Based Violence.

He agreed with the #Shatitalldown representatives that there was a need to be creative and to do more to protect vulnerable sectors of the community such as women and children.

In addition to continuous engagement during the implementation of the response measures as demanded by the protesters in their petition participants of the meeting also agreed to the establishment of a technical committee comprised of youth leaders against Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) and other stakeholders, including Government.

President Geingob assured the representatives of the #Shutitalldown movement that a policy of zero tolerance would be pursued and as part of the ethos of Transparency and Accountability and further assured them that the doors of the Presidency would always be open for dialogue and for finding common solutions to problems facing Namibians.","Staff ReporterNAMIBIANS must find new and creative ways to collectively tackle the scourge of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.

“When it comes to the ocean, we are still hunter-gatherers”, says Vincent Doumeizel, a senior advisor on ocean-based solutions at the UN Global Compact, and an evangelist for seaweed. “By farming just two per cent of the ocean, we could provide enough protein to feed a world population of 12 billion people. Seaweed is extremely protein rich, low in fat, low in carbohydrates, and rich in vitamins, zinc and iron”.

As any fan of sushi will already know, certain forms of seaweed are edible for human consumption. Whilst seaweed has been popular in Asia, particularly Japan, for many years, it is slowly becoming better known throughout the rest of the world, and Mr. Doumeizel is confident that it has the potential to become a mainstream food. “Most Japanese people eat seaweed three times a day, it is used in many dishes in Korea, and is eaten by many people in China. This may be a major factor in cutting the levels of non-communicable diseases in these countries.

Underwater carbon capture

Mr. Doumeizel also touts the environmental benefits of seaweed, particularly as an ingredient in animal feed: “Seaweed doesn’t need land, fresh water, or pesticides, just sun and saltwater. If livestock were fed on seaweed-based foodstuffs, rather than soy, methane emissions could be cut by 90 per cent, and improve digestion whilst boosting the animals’ immune systems, which reduces the need for antibiotics. This is already happening in some countries, such as Scotland and Iceland”.

Seaweed has many other uses and benefits, as an organic fertilizer, a sustainable replacement for plastics, and an ingredient in cosmetics and medicines. It also plays a role in tackling ocean pollution, cleaning the water of nitrates and phosphates.

Given the vast range of benefits seaweed offers, why isn’t it being used more widely? Technical barriers are one reason, according to Mr. Doumeizel. “There is a lack of space to grow underwater forests near shorelines, and it can be difficult to get a licence to grow them off-shore. We need to learn from oil companies, which have a lot of experience in dealing with strong ocean currents and waves”.

Manahas Farquhar Matthew Morgan Farming just 2 per cent of the Ocean could feed 12 billion people.

In fact, one company with big plans to expand seaweed production, is run by a former executive at international oil company, Shell. Kelp Blue is planning to grow huge underwater forests of seaweed off the coast of Namibia, covering some 70,000 hectares. These forests, say the company, would help to solve the world’s food crisis whilst, at the same time, removing vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and creating hundreds of jobs.

They would be populated by giant kelp, a form of seaweed that can grow to 100 feet (30 metres). According to Kelp Blue, one million tons of carbon dioxide would be locked away by the forests and, because one of the main products from kelp is feed for livestock, it has the potential to remove much more, via reduced methane emissions. An added possible side benefits of the forests is a projected growth in fish stocks in the surrounding waters of up to 20 per cent, with the expectation that around 200 species would their home within the kelp.

The seaweed manifesto

Whilst companies like Kelp Blue appear to have solutions to technical challenges, the main obstacle that still needs to be overcome is a lack of global safety standards for seaweed products, and resistance to collaboration, in an industry still driven by relatively small companies and entrepreneurs, who are not keen to share.

To overcome this problem, the UN Global Compact has published a seaweed manifesto, which calls for internationally agreed standards, new investment efforts, and greater collaboration between governments, science and industry, to drive production to the next level.

The manifesto was officially launched one the sidelines of the 2020 UN General Assembly, at an online event which brought together several players from the private and public sector, and featured Alexandra Cousteau, grand-daughter of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, and founder of Oceans 2050, a campaign and action platform dedicated to restoring ocean health over the next thirty years.

If it succeeds, the seaweed industry could find itself playing a much greater role in fighting the climate crisis, strengthening marine ecosystems and bringing the world closer to the big prize: an end to hunger.","Seaweed is extremely protein rich, low in fat, low in carbohydrates, and rich in vitamins, zinc and iron”.

Where Are We Now?,"The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is one of the 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in 2015 which aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030. The rise in food insecurity over the years has become a concerning global issue as the number of hungry and undernourished people continues to increase as a result of war, climate anomalies, poverty and increase in population in certain parts of the world. In addition, the increase in international food prices has severely impacted food production costs, particularly in food-exporting countries. As a result, countries have sought ways to protect themselves from price shocks by imposing export restrictions. According to the UN, an estimated 821 million people in the world suffered from food hunger in 2018. Currently, the rise and consequences of the coronavirus adds further challenges to achieving the zero hunger target by 2030 and may not be achieved if we fail to act.

According to UN statistics, over 2 billion people do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, including 8% of the population in North America and Europe. Africa has been identified as the region with the highest rate of undernourishment of approximately 20%. Western Asia follows with more than 12%, and Latin America and the Caribbean with a prevalence of under 7%. Prior to the current pandemic, drought and conflict had been the primary causes of food insecurity around the globe in addition to population increase and poverty. For example, in the horn of Africa, climate anomalies such as drought and rainfall shortage has exacerbated food insecurity, as approximately 80% of the population live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for food and income. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says drought is considered the most catastrophic natural disaster in the Horn of Africa causing widespread famine while periodic floods also increases the presence of locusts in the region.

Conflict also exacerbates food insecurity, as men are not able to engage in agricultural production. This diverts the resources from uses that would be beneficial to the whole community and as a result the international community has to step in to provide assistance to those affected. Conflict also has a severe impact on the poor leaving them more disadvantaged by displacing them from their homes and their resources. Lastly, the increase in population in developing countries also increases the demand for food production, particularly in places with a low prevalence of contraception use. Furthermore, the increase in rural-urban migration has also impacted food production, especially for farmers through decreased productivity and less land to feed themselves in order to supply and meet the demands of expanding cities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global food security. According to the September 2020 report by the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE), lockdown measures by individual states have significantly affected the availability of food, causing a dramatic increase in hunger and undernourishment around the world. According to the UN World Food Programme, an additional 130 million people are at risk of facing acute food insecurity by the end of 2020. The lockdown measures to contain the spread of the virus have proved to cause disruptions to food supply chains through the closure of restaurants and other food service facilities, loss of income and livelihoods.

They have also widened the inequality gap and brought disruptions to social protection programmes. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 400 million full-time jobs have been lost in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of lockdown measures enforced in a number of countries, further exacerbating inequities by relating to access to basic needs and healthcare. Although lockdown measures have helped contain the spread of the coronavirus, the global food security crisis will further deteriorate as each economy suffers from higher rates of unemployment and poverty.

According to the 2020 Global Hunger Index (GHI), worldwide hunger is currently at moderate level . However, a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the highest hunger and undernutrition levels around the globe. Countries considered to have alarming levels of hunger are Chad, Timor-Leste and Madagascar. Hunger levels have also worsened in conflict affected states including Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia , South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The GHI further estimated that approximately 37 countries will fail to even reach low hunger by 2030, therefore implying that the world is not on track to achieve SDG 2.

For decades, world hunger and the food security crisis has been a challenge for the international community and measures have been taken by world leaders, intergovernmental bodies and non-profit organizations to address this issue. For instance, in 1996, world leaders made a commitment in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action in the FAO World Food Summit to reduce by half the number of hungry and undernourished people by 2015. Today, there are UN agencies that cater to food security such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The WFP has been recognized for its efforts to combat hunger and in conflict affected areas like Yemen in 2018. The WFP has been recognized for its role in enhancing access to contested natural resources. For example, it has helped with engagement of communities by rehabilitating irrigation canals and pipelines in disputed territories along Kyrgyztan’s border with Tajikistan. This resulted in an increase in water supply and agricultural productivity which helped address inter-community conflict.

Overall, it is evident that there has been some progress towards addressing food insecurity around the globe, although we may not be at the pace towards achieving zero hunger by 2030. Addressing global food insecurity requires a multi-faceted approach as there are underlying issues that need to be simultaneously addressed, such as poverty and climate change. The increasingly interdependent nature of the global economy today highlights the need for joint efforts from the international community in addressing this issue. However, there are ways in which we as individuals and states can do our part by minimizing food waste, supporting efforts to alleviate the food security crisis through donations, ensuring fair trade policies and encouraging the use of sustainable resources. It is also important to note that we all have different starting points in life in terms of opportunities which leaves some more disadvantaged than others. Therefore, addressing these inequality gaps by providing conditions for an equitable society are key in helping eradicate poverty and food insecurity around the globe.","The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is one of the 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in 2015 which aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

It comes at a time when the world is facing the impacts of Covid-19 amidst multiple natural hazards, shocks and transboundary pests.

Despite past achievements, five years into the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the world is not on track to achieve zero hunger. The number of people affected by hunger globally has been on the rise since 2014. FAO currently estimates that nearly 690 million people are hungry, the majority of them being in Asia. This is an addition of 10m people in one year and nearly 60m in five years. Looking beyond starvation, over two billion people do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. The Covid-19 pandemic could further add 83m to 132m food-insecure people worldwide. Globally, the prevalence of food insecurity at a moderate or severe level is higher among women than men. The gender gap in accessing food increased from 2018 to 2019.

In Pakistan, the Prevalence of Undernourishment — an important indicator for measuring our progress on SDG 2 Zero Hunger — has slowly declined to 26m Pakistanis in 2017-19, from about 33m in 2003-04. Some of the gains were however reversed by climate-related shocks, such as the floods of 2010-13, as well as recent challenges of drought, more floods, locusts and Covid-19 impacts. With all this to bear, we can expect a deterioration in Pakistan’s food security as we head towards the end of 2020 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Economic slowdowns due to lockdowns, such as Pakistan experienced in 2019-20, tend to increase poverty, which is closely interlinked with food insecurity. The shocks are consequently affecting poorer commu­nities disproportionately, and pushing those in the most uncertain contexts deeper into poverty and hunger, with an important impact on the stability of access to adequate, safe and nutritious food for households. Access to food is also under threat for more vulnerable households because of food price fluctuations observed in a range of Pakistani markets since the onset of Covid-19.

We can expect a deterioration in food security.

Food insecurity can lead to different manifestations of malnutrition. The kind of and relative amounts of food people eat, specifically, the quality of their diet, translates into how our body utilises it and is directly linked with health and energy. In Pakistan, access to healthy, balanced diets is a challenge. Shifting to healthy diets can contribute to reducing health and climate-change costs because the hidden costs of these healthy diets are lower. The adoption of healthy diets can lead to a reduction of up to 97 per cent in direct and indirect health costs and 41–74pc in the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Dietary habits in Pakistan require realignment to more balanced, nutritious ingredients, by making a diverse range of foods accessible to the poor and by educating everyone on the negative health consequences of a diet dominated by energy-dense, low-nutrient foods.

On food availability, Pakistan has fared well, with a 2.7pc growth in agriculture in 2019-20 within an overall economic contr­ac­tion of 0.4pc. However, the growth was mos­tly due to livestock and three major crops. This relates to the challenge where only nine plant species in the world account for 66pc of crop production worldwide, despite over 30,000 known edible plants. Pakistan can do better at growing more diverse food.

If the pandemic has laid bare the fragility of agri-food systems, the precariousness of the agricultural labour force, the thin line that separates families from destitution, there are solutions.

This year, we celebrate the food heroes that have continued to grow, sustain and nourish us, and recognise more needs to be done: review the food supply chain in the context of the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investments, and put smallholder farmers at the centre of it; government, civil society and private sector engage in collective efforts to ensure smallholder farmers and off-farm ag-workers, women and men, can access financial resources, knowledge, technology and innovation; organise campaigns and leverage the Pakistan Dietary Guidelines for Better Nutrition to promote healthy eating habits; recognise invisible labour of agriculture workers; provide access to land to women and men farmers; rethink policies and actions to tackle agriculture productivity, climate change and food systems transformation with ambition and urgency to ensure the ‘new normal’ is better; call for and facilitate collective cross-sectoral action, global collaboration to support the vulnerable in times of shocks and crises.

Our future food systems need to ensure affordable and healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for food system workers, while preserving natural resources and biodiversity. This will help go a long way towards achieving zero hunger.

The report finds that rapid breakthroughs in the areas of energy, industry, transport, human settlements, ocean and coastal zones, water, nature-based solutions and land use, and climate resilience are approaching “the tipping points necessary to reach zero emissions by 2050.”

The ‘Climate Action Pathways’ seek to provide a “blueprint” to coordinate climate action by cities, regions, businesses, and investors in the runup to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021. The pathways identify the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in each of the eight sectors considered. They provide an overview of “synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas that assist all actors to take an integrated approach.”

As an example, the transformational actions and milestones needed to achieve zero-carbon economy for ocean and coastal zones include:

Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are ended by 2021, and science-based management is implemented to restore fish stocks in the shortest time possible;

30% of fully and highly protected marine protected areas are designated and implemented by 2030;

Resilience and adaptive capacity of ocean-dependent coastal communities (fisheries and aquaculture) are increased, and vulnerability assessments are conducted by 2025; and

Stable market of zero-carbon fuels is ensured by 2030.

Speaking at the launch, High-Level Climate Champion Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) underscored the need for “a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050” to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. “[I]t is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead,” he said.

Some experts are skeptical,"Canada has expressed interest in a new, smaller type of nuclear reactor that proponents say will be critical to help the country reach its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But there is debate among researchers, advocates and other experts on whether these new reactors are necessary to reach net-zero — or whether it's better accomplished by focusing efforts elsewhere.

Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, cautions that any stance on the role small modular reactors will play in Canada's energy future depends on research and data that could still be years away.

""We have a data set, currently, of zero,"" he told What on Earth.

""You can forecast what they might be based on technical assessments ... but it's based on no real data. It's based just on what we hope will come out of different plans.""

Small modular reactors, or SMRs for short, are smaller than a conventional nuclear power plant and can be manufactured in a factory before being transported and assembled elsewhere — something proponents say will lower costs.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN organization for nuclear cooperation, considers an SMR to be ""small"" if it generates under 300 megawatts of electricity, compared to traditional nuclear reactors that typically generate about 800 megawatts, or about enough to power about 600,000 homes at once (assuming that 1 megawatt can power about 750 homes).

The federal government called it the ""next wave of innovation"" in nuclear energy technology and an ""important technology opportunity for Canada.""

In October, the federal government announced it was investing $20 million into Terrestrial Energy to help the Oakville, Ont., company develop its design of a small modular reactor.

Last December, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe released a joint statement committing to developing SMRs in Canada. Alberta joined that agreement in August. While the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is currently conducting pre-licensing reviews on several designs, forecasts suggest it could be years, perhaps 2030, before SMRs would be operating in Canada.

(CBC News)

According to the Canadian Nuclear Association's SMR roadmap, the small reactors would help replace energy capacity lost by closing coal plants, help power off-grid projects like mines and oilsands sites, and replace diesel fuel in remote communities.

""We have not seen a model where we can get to net-zero emissions by 2050 without nuclear,"" Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan told The House in September.

""This is a zero-emission energy source.""

Nuclear energy is actually considered a low-emission — not zero-emission — energy source by the International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others .

While the nuclear fission that takes place inside a reactor doesn't emit carbon, greenhouse gas emissions result from the surrounding processes and operations: mining the uranium, building the reactor and its eventual decommission.

""When you look at the entire fuel cycle and you broaden the lens across it, you start to capture a whole host of emissions that are often excluded,"" said Benjamin Sovacool, director of the energy group at the University of Sussex, and a lead author for the IPCC on how to mitigate climate change between now and 2050.

Sovacool said that renewables like solar and wind provide a bigger bang for the buck to lower emissions, and are widely available now, unlike SMRs.

""Nuclear power is like fighting world hunger with caviar, it's like using the most expensive option when there are far more plentiful and nutritious options available when you account for the costs,"" he told What on Earth.

'A real, necessary tool': Nuclear association head

John Gorman, however, is convinced nuclear power is the way forward — and that SMRs are a crucial part of the plan.

He's the president and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Association — but before that, he was head of the Canadian Solar Industries Association.

""When I moved over from the renewable side, I had to do a lot of homework to really look into the technology, its track record, the way that it deals with some of the issues that are of most concern to people,"" he told Lynch.

""I've come to the realization after all of that that really there is no way to net zero without nuclear. And secondly, it just is a really safe, remarkable technology.""

Gorman pointed to decades of North American experience working with nuclear energy, and affirmed the importance of going through the regulatory process throughout development to ensure SMRs are as safe and efficient as possible.

He said the seven-to-10-year estimates for SMRs to become a reality in Canada are ""a blink of an eye in terms of energy planning,"" and that they will become ""a real, necessary tool"" for Canada's net-zero targets.

Kammen isn't convinced that SMRs have quite yet earned a green light.

""You ... have to worry about the end of life and the risk issues that are not a feature of wind or solar,"" he said.,

""A bad batch of solar panels is actually a learning event, whereas a bad batch of components for a nuclear plant can be catastrophic.""

SMRs 'a dangerous distraction': Environmentalist rep

Kerrie Blaise, staff lawyer at the Canadian Environmental Law Association, said SMRs and nuclear energy present ""a dangerous distraction from real climate action.""

Her stance is echoed by more than 25 environment and citizens' groups, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and Equiterre, which released a statement in October .

Blaise said the modular nature of SMRs means that fuel for the reactors — and, eventually, the radioactive waste they produce — will have to be transported more frequently, especially if they are deployed in remote locations like mines and Indigenous communities.

She added that ""the economics don't add up"" regarding arguments that nuclear energy should be ""part of the mix"" along with renewable energy.

""The cost of renewables continues to go down due to incremental manufacturing and installation improvements, while nuclear, despite having had half a century of industrial experience, continues to have costs that are rising,"" she said.

Nuclear power has been declining worldwide for decades, and cost has been one challenge, according to a 2019 report from the IEA, which said ""new projects have been plagued by cost overruns and delays.""

Kammen said he's seen a large amount of private sector investment in SMRs, which could help accelerate development to make it competitive alongside renewables like solar and wind.

But it will be some time, he said, before anyone can guess what ""mix of technologies"" will be best.

""These new nuclear plants need to perform at a cost level that we have not seen. They need to perform at a reliability level we haven't seen.... And then finally, the most critically, these plants have to be demonstrated to be operated safely during their lifetime and for the fuel management at the end of life cycle,"" he said.

""That's a big list of ifs. So I'm rooting for nuclear, but I think that list of challenges is exceedingly long.""

By Kim Harrisberg

JOHANNESBURG, Nov 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cape Town faces an 80% higher chance of another 'Day Zero' drought by the end of the century if greenhouse gas-emissions keep rising at current rates, research showed on Monday, as the South African city races to safeguard water supplies.

Following a 2018 drought in South Africa that nearly caused Cape Town's taps to run dry, known as Day Zero, officials have been working to avert further water crises that could put lives at risk and destroy livelihoods in the coming years.

Using new high-resolution simulations, researchers from Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated the role climate change could play in future droughts across the globe.

""In the worst-case scenario, events like the 'Day Zero' drought may become about 100 times more likely than they were in the early 20th-century world,"" said lead author Salvatore Pascale, a research scientist at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.

Around the world, stronger El Nino weather patterns and climate change are bringing harsher and more frequent droughts, and already-dry southern Africa has been particularly hard hit.

Cape Town's first ""Day Zero"" was only averted by the city making an aggressive push to conserve water, and officials hope that similar efforts can lessen the impact of future droughts in the country's second-biggest city.

Knowing the risk of drought recurrence, the city is increasing the use of groundwater, building a desalination plant, clearing water-hungry invasive plants and working towards a water reuse scheme, said a statement by city authorities.

""The strategy has already committed to delivering more than 300 million litres of additional supply per day over 10 years,"" Alderman Xanthea Limberg, the city's mayoral committee member for water and waste, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Stanford study said parts of the world with a similar climate to South Africa, like California, southern Australia, southern Europe and parts of South America could face their own Day Zero droughts in the years ahead.

The climate modelling systems used in the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed a drought as severe as Day Zero could occur two or three times in a decade in southwestern South Africa.

The study also showed that the 2018 drought was made five-six times more likely by man-made climate change.

""I'm sure that many Cape Town residents have forgotten what happened now that lakes and water reservoirs are back to normal,"" Pascale said.

""But this is the moment to rethink the old way of managing water for a future when there will be less water available.""

From initially re-establishing in 2006 to support the peace process in Mindanao, providing lifesaving food assistance in emergencies and disasters, improving the nutrition of tens of thousands of vulnerable populations, to development programmes that seek to improve the overall quality of life of the people it serves. Throughout all these activities, improving the food security and nutrition of the Filipino people was at the very core and the beating heart of its programming.

In 2020, the President of the Philippines signed Executive Order 101 creating an InterAgency Task Force on Zero Hunger (IATFZH).

The Task Force endeavors to put an end to hunger in the country by 2030, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero Hunger. As a staunch partner advocating zero hunger and informing policies on food security and nutrition in the country, WFP was a natural partner to this undertaking.

Together with other United Nations agencies such as the United Nations’ Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and World Health Organization (WHO), WFP had been selected by the Government to support the Zero Hunger Task Force in developing the National Food Policy and achieve the goals of the Task Force.

The Zero Hunger Task Force, led by the Cabinet Secretary, had set out six key results areas (KRA), each with their working group, disaggregate the priorities and assigned niche experts to ensure that each is on track to be achieved by 2030. WFP is currently providing technical assistance across all six KRAs which are as follows:

1) Review and Rationalization of Existing Policies, Rules, Regulations related to the EO

2) Ensure Available and Affordable food

3) Secure Nutrition Adequacy

4) Secure Food Accessibility and Safety

5) Ensure Resiliency and Food Stability for Emergencies

6) Ensure Information, Education, Awareness and People Participation

WFP’s wide array of experience in the food security and nutrition area will allow the agency to lend its expertise to the Government. In particular, lessons learned from projects – which include the iron-fortified rice pilot, stunting prevention programme, agricultural livelihood support in Mindanao, disaster preparedness and response, integration of food security and nutrition into local plans, and an upcoming social behavioral change communication project – enables WFP to provide extensive, specialized, and well-informed guidance in the development and popularization of the National Food Policy launched during World Food Day, 16th of October 2020.","The Philippine Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger The World Food Programme’s presence in the Philippines is constantly evolving.

The resurgence of hunger is one of the greatest problems we face today. A toxic mix of widespread civil war, poverty, and COVID-19 threatens to bring mass starvation on an unprecedented scale. Sadly, ending hunger and malnutrition is the one UN Sustainable Development Goal on which we have failed to make progress in recent years.

The World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 for “its efforts to combat hunger, for its contributions to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-afflicted areas, and for acting as a driving force to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”

Saudi Arabia has long advocated for global attention to food security issues. At the recent G20 meeting hosted in the Kingdom, members committed to greater investments in agricultural development. At various moments in history when the WFP faced funding shortfalls, Saudi Arabia came to the rescue of those most in need by making significant contributions; in the 1970s, and during the sharp rise in food prices in 2008, the Kingdom made the largest cash donations to WFP by a single donor up to those dates, which helped the WFP implement programs aimed at lessening the impact. In 2019, the Kingdom was the WFP’s fifth-largest donor through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center. Last year alone, the Kingdom invested $440 million in food assistance and agricultural development in 36 countries worldwide, the main focus being support to the WFP in Yemen for the past five years.

While starvation in conflict zones easily draws attention in the media, chronic hunger does not. There are so many drivers behind it: Poverty, discrimination, environmental degradation, and insufficient investment in agriculture. With each passing year, climate change inflicts more harm on farmers as they struggle to cope with rising temperatures and cruel cycles of flood and drought. After harvest, an astonishing 1.3 billion tons of food simply go to waste each year.

Add COVID-19 to the global hunger equation and we could soon see another pandemic — a hunger pandemic as brutally relentless as the virus itself. COVID-19 has taken over 1.7 million lives already. If we allow it to create a second pandemic of hunger and malnutrition, the cost in lives lost will be far more devastating. Hunger and malnutrition are already efficient killers, taking the lives of over 3 million children under 5 each year. We cannot allow the spread of COVID-19 to add fuel to that fire.

The COVID-19 pandemic has eaten into harvests, disrupted supply chains, and decimated the incomes of tens of millions of households. Where food is available, each day more people lack the money to buy it. All told, 270 million people may find themselves in an extreme hunger crisis in 2021, including about 30 million already on the brink of starvation.

What is the way forward? First, we must press all parties to honor the UN secretary-general's call for a global cease-fire, which is consistent with the Kingdom’s policy focused on peace as its strategic choice and one of the most important pillars of its foreign policy. If most hunger stems from politics, we need political solutions. Brokering peace will not only curb outbreaks of hunger in war zones, it will stem the surge of refugees and economic migrants now overwhelming many host countries.

Second, we must position food in the most vulnerable regions by year’s end. This is not just a task for governments. We all must help. If there was ever a time to share, it is now.

Third, we must take a strategic approach to aid working in tandem and with a true spirit of collaboration. “Smart funding” through multiyear and multisector donations can help donors have a broad impact beyond containing emergencies. Better targeting of aid to focus more on women and girls would surely pay off, as they are most often the victims of malnutrition. It is not enough for us to save lives if we do not fundamentally change lives.

Finally, we must build resilience in societies so they can better withstand shocks like COVID-19 in the future. We must start with youth. School closures have ended school meals for 370 million school children around the world and the WFP, Saudi Arabia, and other donors are already providing food assistance to strengthen nutrition and prevent disease among them. We cannot let a generation in the developing world become collateral damage in this pandemic — malnourished and uneducated, with little hope of leading productive lives.

If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is empathy. Even in wealthy nations, families with jobs one day could find themselves relying on government aid or food banks the next. Tens of millions in the developed world today no longer take food for granted and share the worries of the world’s poor in a way we never imagined possible. Perhaps in the pain COVID-19 has thrust upon us, we can finally come together and work toward building a world without hunger.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

The United Nations calls on countries to swiftly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a just and equitable world in the decades ahead. You can join us in taking action on related issues here

Countries have to speed up their efforts to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid severe effects of climate change, according to the United Nations.

Right now, around 115 countries accounting for roughly 50% of global emissions have pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. China, the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, has committed to reaching this point by 2060.

The UN is calling on all countries to make similar net zero commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

But while pledges like these are key for generating global climate action momentum, they need to be backed by concrete plans and clear financing mechanisms, according to the UN.

In other words, countries must lay out exactly how net zero goals will be executed and then fully fund these plans, an undertaking that will require global cooperation. Wealthy countries will have to invest in adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change, but stand to face the harshest consequences from it, through the UN’s Green Climate Fund that calls for $100 billion in annual funding.

“No such bold commitments have yet been made to mobilize the finance necessary to achieve the net zero commitment by 2050 nor, more broadly, the SDGs,” António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, recently said in a speech calling on countries to increase climate commitments.

In the midst of a global pandemic, worsening climate disasters, dwindling natural resources, and growing protest movements calling for climate action, Guterres said that countries have a unique opportunity to chart a new, bolder path forward.

Countries can outline this path through their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are due as part of the Paris climate agreement.

Achieving net zero emissions is not just about avoiding doomsday scenarios of extreme storms and droughts, higher temperatures and rising sea levels.

It’s mostly about achieving a more just, equitable, and joyous world.

Getting to Net Zero

“Net zero emissions” doesn’t mean that emissions from human activities will be fully eliminated. Instead, it means that human-related emissions — from vehicles, agriculture, energy production, and so on — will be reduced to a level so low that they can be offset by efforts to absorb and otherwise remove emissions from the atmosphere. In this way, the grand total of emissions in the air would not increase.

And that’s critical because countries are rapidly running out of the remaining global carbon budget — the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be released if countries want to achieve the Paris climate agreement. As of 2018, countries had a 50% chance of staying under the 1.5 degrees Celsius level if they collectively emitted less than 580 gigatons of carbon dioxide going forward.

Since countries annually release around 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and were expected to reach 50 gigatons annually by 2030, they were on track to all but lock in temperature increases beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted economies around the world, leading to an unexpected decline in emissions. While scientists believe that emissions will rebound after the pandemic, many countries have vowed to recover economically by investing in climate action initiatives such as green infrastructure, clean energy production, and sustainable agriculture.

As a result, the next decade could feature ongoing emissions reductions that could put the world back on track to achieving the Paris climate agreement.

In fact, the UN argues that countries can only stay within the safe zone of temperature increases if emissions decline by 7.6% annually by 2030 and then zero out by 2050.

This can only happen if countries truly seize the moment to reimagine and restructure their economies and, more broadly, their societies.

What Net Zero Looks Like

A net zero world involves every aspect of human society.

Most immediately, it means that countries will generate their electricity from clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. The International Energy Agency reports that 90% of new electricity generation added in 2020 came from clean energy sources and that the next decade will feature explosive renewable energy growth.

Countries also have to make their buildings and homes energy efficient. All the technology exists to make this happen — from smart heating and cooling systems to solar paneled roofs to improved insulation — but countries have to mobilize the resources.

Transportation systems have to be transformed in multiple ways. First, gasoline-powered cars have to be phased out and replaced with electric vehicles. Second, countries have to modernize their public transportation systems to ensure that citizens have reliable alternatives to cars that are less environmentally intensive.

Agriculture is another major source of emissions that has to be addressed. Countries can do this by investing in smallholder rather than industrial farmers, advocating for regenerative agriculture that restores soil, promoting plant-based diets that have less of an impact on the environment, and producing more food on less agricultural land.

Agriculture is one of the leading causes of deforestation and environmental degradation. Getting to net zero emissions requires countries to expand forested areas, swamplands, peat bogs, and other natural ecosystems that absorb emissions from the atmosphere, the UN says.

Transforming society in these ways has benefits far beyond avoiding catastrophic temperature increases.

By phasing out coal, oil, and natural gas, air, water, and food pollution will decrease worldwide, improving the quality of life of billions of people. Transforming agricultural systems to focus on sustainability means that people will have greater access to healthy foods and more food sovereignty. Making homes more efficient means that energy bills will be lower for consumers. On a global scale, these projects will generate millions of good-paying jobs, while also promoting the tenets of climate justice, a philosophy that strives to ensure equitable and just livelihoods for all.

A world of climate justice would mean that everyone has access to clean water, air, and food, safe and dignified shelter, meaningful work, and the ability to cultivate community — all core aspects of the UN’s Global Goals.

In their updated NDCs, Switzerland and Costa Rica commit to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform (Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay) and the UK issued a joint statement, encouraging countries and stakeholders to continue reform and ensure the COVID-19 economic recovery is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

UK Submits First NDC

The UK’s NDC, submitted on 12 December, represents an increase from its previous contribution to the EU’s intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to amount to a 53% reduction on reference levels. According to the UK’s independent statutory body, Climate Change Committee, the country’s new target aligns with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways towards a 1.5°C goal.

By raising ambition, the UK signals its leadership role as co-host of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in 2021. In 2021, the UK will also preside over the Group of Seven (G7), and COP 26 co-host Italy will hold the Group of 20 (G20) presidency.

The UK intends to meet its NDC mitigation targets through reducing emissions domestically, and reserves the right to use voluntary cooperation, such as through the use of emissions trading systems and emissions reduction or removal units. The UK’s NDC encompasses emissions and removals from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The scope of the NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and shipping. The communication covers the following sectors: energy (including transport); industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and waste.

The NDC informs of institutional structures and updates on policy measures, including an amendment to the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2019, committing the UK to a legally-binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Act also introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, and established the Climate Change Committee to provide advice.

The NDC highlights the UK’s progress on climate action policy areas linked to the SDGs, including:

In the area of food security and policy, the UK is phasing down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including in refrigeration equipment for food storage and distribution, in line with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

Addressing ocean and marine environment, the UK will introduce a sustainable fisheries policy, giving consideration to climate change in marine planning, building ecological resilience at sea, and protecting natural carbon stores through the UK’s network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Regarding terrestrial biodiversity in England, the government will publish a new strategy for nature following agreement of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), expected in 2021.

To promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, the UK supports a sustainable food system, and has a resources and waste strategy to move towards a more circular and sustainable economy.

The UK’s Clean Air Strategy aims to tackle air pollution, noted as the top environmental risk to human health in the UK.

The UK describes its adaptation actions in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Switzerland Submits Updated and Enhanced NDC

Switzerland’s updated NDC, communicated on 9 December, states its enhanced ambition is in line with IPCC recommendations to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 40-50% compared with 2010 levels by 2030, to limit global warming to 1.5°C . The country commits to climate neutrality by 2050, which is an increase on its previous objective of a 70-85% emissions reduction by 2050.

The NDC describes Switzerland’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which corresponds to an average reduction of at least 3% over the period 2021-2030. Switzerland anticipates to reach GHG emissions reductions of at least 35% by 2025. The NDC also represents a “progression” in terms of, inter alia: a 25% increase of the domestic share of emissions reduction, from 60% to at least 75%; and compensation of imported “grey” emissions through additional emission reductions abroad, not counted towards Switzerland’s emissions reduction objectives.

The NDC anticipates Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) from cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 “will partly be used.” It informs of Switzerland’s bilateral agreements with Peru and Ghana that govern the transfers of mitigation outcomes and their use, and define the method for corresponding adjustment.

The NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and navigation, although Switzerland’s domestic emissions reduction targets incorporate emissions from national aviation and navigation. According to the NDC, a part of emissions from international aviation is covered by the Swiss emission trading scheme (ETS) as well as by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

In the energy sector, the NDC notes Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050, with the objective to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. The country, it states, needs to replace the share of its nuclear energy, given the government’s decision to gradually phase out nuclear energy. The NDC also notes that, according to Switzerland’s seventh national communication to the UNFCCC, around three-quarters of Switzerland’s GHG emissions result from fossil fuel use.

The NDC informs of a 2019 popular initiative, calling for a constitutional article to stipulate a ban of fossil fuels as of 2050. Switzerland emphasizes it is actively reviewing its remaining fossil fuel subsidies, and is engaged in Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (FFFSR) – an informal group of non-G20 countries working to build political consensus on the importance of fossil fuel subsidy reform.

Besides energy (including transport), Switzerland’s mitigation commitments cover industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste. Switzerland’s adaptation actions are described in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Costa Rica Communicates NDC Update

In its NDC update of 11 December (in Spanish), Costa Rica announces it is enhancing its climate ambition and will submit a more specific communication by the end of 2020. The update highlights Costa Rica’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and commitment to a maximum budget of net emissions in the 2021-2030 period of 106.53 million tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).

The submission briefly updates on Costa Rica’s legal and institutional framework for climate action, including the country’s 2018 National Adaptation Policy, and the 2019 National Decarbonization Plan presented as a long-term strategy. Costa Rica informs of an enhanced mitigation commitment to an absolute maximum of net emissions by 2030 of 9.11 million tons CO2e, an improvement on the previous maximum of 9.37 million tons CO2e. This target, according to the submission, is consistent with the country’s long-term strategy and the trajectory towards the 1.5°C goal.

Highlighting the need to close social gaps and strengthen economic and environmental resilience in the country, Costa Rica notes its adaptation actions will be outlined in its forthcoming Adaptation Communication.

UK, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Issue Joint Statement

On 10 December, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform and the UK issued a joint statement, stressing the importance of a green recovery from COVID-19, without which “there is a risk that fiscal stimulus packages will further entrench the use of fossil fuels.” The statement recalls the principles outlined in the group’s 2015 communiqué, and welcomes renewed political commitments to reform made since 2015 by the G7, the G20, the Vulnerable Twenty (V20), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders, among others.

The statement recalls the principles that shall inform practical action:

Communication and transparency about the merits of subsidy policies;

Ambition in the scope and timeframe for reform; and

Targeted support to ensure the most vulnerable groups are protected as reforms are implemented.

Due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, COP 26 climate talks were postponed to 2021, and instead, a series of virtual events including the Climate Ambition Summit was held on 12 December 2020, where countries were given the opportunity to provide updates on their adjusted NDCs.

Much has happened in recent months. While the Republic of Korea did not show very ambitious NDC targets earlier this year, President Moon Jae-in announced net zero ambitions for 2050. Likewise, China made a net zero pledge for 2060. The European Union announced enhanced ambitions to cut emissions by 55 per cent from the 1990 level by 2030.

Many other states made commensurate pledges to tackle the climate crisis. A race to resilience was also launched by mayors, community leaders and insurance companies committed to safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of four billion vulnerable people by 2030, which aligns in particular with the priorities of small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs).

While these commitments are positive and more ambitious than earlier NDCs, they are still not ambitious enough to meet the 1.5-degree target and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change. United Kingdon Minister Alok Sharma has called out the world leaders’ failure to show necessary levels of ambition.

Reflecting on priorities ahead of next year’s COP 26, Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) will continue supporting its members’ and partners’ NDC enhancement and implementation through climate and carbon finance mobilisation. However, a key area of focus in 2021 will be to build synergies between climate solutions and green recoveries post-Covid-19.

It is critical to ensure that the unprecedented economic stimulus packages result in lasting shifts toward green development pathways with an explicit focus on employment potential and other socio-economic co-benefits.

The tens of trillions mobilised to recovery efforts provide a big and perhaps last chance to solve the unprecedented challenges as leverage vanishes with rising debt levels and dried-up public funding.

Green recovery packages must be put to work to decarbonise the economy. Renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy, especially when taking account of the extended costs of our reliance on fossil fuels so far.

Circular economy options can drastically reduce waste, and alternatives to fossil fuel are available in the bioeconomy, and nature-based solutions hold tremendous untapped climate mitigation potential with employment and adaptation co-benefits. New technologies are pushing opportunities. Hydrogen can take up where renewable energy cannot reach, and artificial intelligence can push energy efficiency and effective production.

These are trends moving us in the right direction. Explicit focus is required to highlight the economic multipliers and social co-benefits of climate action.

In our collaborative Green Growth Programme with the government of Indonesia, we are promoting nature-based solutions that help halt deforestation, restore carbon-rich wetlands and soils, improve land productivity and water security, and deliver improved livelihoods as well as enhanced climate mitigation and adaptation actions.

Continued and improved investments in biomass-based and solar energy-based electricity generation will bring more and higher quality jobs, food security and climate resilience.

In Vietnam, GGGI works with the government to enhance its NDC ambitions through promoting sustainable urban cooling, energy efficiency digital solutions and increasing green investments with innovative financial instruments such as carbon financing or green bonds through collaborating with the government of Luxembourg.

To verify the employment potential of renewable energy, GGGI’s employment assessments in countries like Indonesia, Rwanda and Mexico show that renewable energy,

Solar PV in particular employs more people per unit of investment compared to fossil fuel-based technologies. A global solar-powered irrigation program, including Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Uganda will improve livelihoods, food security and climate resilience.

While supporting several governments with their NDC revision processes into 2021 with the NDC Partnership and others, technical analysis incorporating employment potential and safeguarding of poor and vulnerable communities is key.

GGGI is supporting several SIDS countries in this regard—Saint Lucia is using a modelling approach to explore how reforming fossil fuel subsidy and taxation schemes can lower fossil fuel consumption while ensuring that vulnerable populations are not negatively impacted. In Antigua & Barbuda, GGGI is developing programs to ensure the inclusion of all segments of the population are included in the transition to renewable energy.

Focusing on green recovery packages and climate action simultaneously means a more effective integration of NDCs and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

While the Covid-19 pandemic has placed emphasis on the socio-economic aspects of climate action, and the importance of assessing and including long-term health and vulnerabilities of the local communities into planning processes, the notion that we must marry sustainable development and climate ambitions have been made evident by the successes and failures of climate action to date.

As the world recovers with the introduction of vaccines, and business and economic activities resume, a change in trajectory towards a green recovery should be at the centre of focus. Looking ahead to COP 26 in Glasgow next year, it is essential that the world does not bounce back to business as usual.

WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan cautioned on Friday against complacency in the wake of vaccine roll-out, saying that although they were a major part of the battle against Covid-19, vaccines would not on their own end the pandemic.

“Vaccines do not equal zero COVID,” he said, as reported by AFP.

Ryan said some countries could risk a “blow up” in cases, and a yo-yoing of the pandemic if they do not ustain very strong control measures for some time into the future.

“We are in a pivotal moment in some countries. There are health systems in some countries at the point of collapse,” he said, without referring to specific countries.

""Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job,"" Ryan told a virtual news conference.

Global coronavirus infections passed 65 million on Friday.

The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.5 million people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.

'Coronavirus pandemic far from over'

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, “Progress on vaccines gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over,”

Tedros said the pandemic still had a long way to run and that decisions made by citizens and governments would determine its course in the short run and when the pandemic would ultimately end.

“We know it’s been a hard year and people are tired, but in hospitals that are running at or over capacity it’s the hardest it can possibly be,” Reuters quoted Tedros as saying.

'Vaccine will not be with everyone early next year'

As per a report in AFP, Ryan also said, ""I have seen vaccines transform the world and change the course of epidemics, and I fully expect that these vaccines and the ones that are to come will do that,""

But he warned that people needed to recognise that the vaccine ""will not be with everyone early next year"", reported AFP.

Health workers, the elderly and people with underlying conditions will get priority -- a choice that ""will take a lot of the sorrow out of this pandemic. But it will not, by itself, end transmission,"" said Ryan.

Poor could be 'trampled' in vaccine push, warns WHO

Speaking at a virtual UN summit on the pandemic, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""Let me be clear. We simply cannot accept a world in which the poor and marginalized are trampled by the rich and powerful in the stampede for vaccines. This is a global crisis and the solutions must be shared equitably as global public goods. Not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind"".

As per a report in AFP, he also warned that the world has plenty of other challenges, saying: ""There is no vaccine for poverty, no vaccine for hunger. There is no vaccine for inequality. There is no vaccine for climate change.""

Meanwhile, Tedros, an Ethiopian doctor and diplomat, said he was happy to be vaccinated on camera to help promote public confidence, but would not jump the queue to do so. ""I would be happy to do it"" but ""I have to make sure it's my turn"", AFP quoted him as saying.

(With inputs from AFP, Reuters)","“Vaccines do not equal zero COVID,” he said, as reported by AFP.
There are health systems in some countries at the point of collapse,” he said, without referring to specific countries.
""Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have.
We simply cannot accept a world in which the poor and marginalized are trampled by the rich and powerful in the stampede for vaccines.
""I would be happy to do it"" but ""I have to make sure it's my turn"", AFP quoted him as saying."
