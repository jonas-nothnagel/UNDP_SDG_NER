There was bad news – catastrophic actually – on three fronts:

Cape Town’s water usage went up again, to over 600-million litres per day, despite major efforts, over six months, to bring it down below 500-million litres.

The SA Weather Service informed us that as far as forecasting goes, we are flying blind. Last year the forecast of a wet winter proved to be widely off the mark. On Friday, the SA Weather service told us bluntly: We cannot predict whether or when rain will come. Previous forecasting models have proved useless in the era of climate change.

Day Zero – when the taps in suburbia are switched off – has moved from the realm of possibility to probability. There is no way in which water augmentation schemes will compensate for our ongoing failure to curb demand sufficiently in the short term .

This latter message, in particular, broke the sound barrier. Suddenly, after months of coaxing communication (“if we save water together we can avoid day zero”), the mayor changed gear: We are past the point of no return, she said. Day Zero is almost unavoidable. We WILL run out of water by the end of April unless everyone reduces their water usage to less than 50 litres per person per day.

The response to this announcement showed that reality had finally sunk in.

As the mayor’s press conference was under way, I called in the Province’s Head of Legal Services and said: “The crash the City has been trying to avoid now seems inevitable. We are bracing for impact. Sticking to the Province’s constitutional mandate of support and oversight is not enough in these circumstances.”

The answer I received was: “The legal test for provincial intervention in a local government mandate is when a municipality cannot or does not fulfil an executive obligation. At the moment the City is focusing on strategies to curb water use, augment supply, prepare for day Zero and communicate with citizens.

“When it comes to the functions of the national Department of Water and Sanitation, the province has no powers at all,” he added.

And, to underscore the point, as we grappled with the full scale of the crisis this weekend, the national Parliament tweeted this crisp message to the provincial Ministry of Local Government:

It could not be clearer than that.

Until last week, I accepted the legal argument that it would be difficult for the Province to cite “failure to fulfil an executive obligation” as a reason to intervene in the City’s preparations. They obviously cannot distribute water that the bulk supply system has not produced.

The principle (that each sphere of government must respect the integrity, mandate and functions of other spheres) is entrenched in our Constitution. Court judgments have been consistent: a sphere of government trying to interfere with the mandate of another has always been pushed back. Even a “mandamus” obliging the national department of Water and Sanitation to provide bulk water supplies would have to be sought by the City, not the province.

Last week, I still accepted these stringent limits on the province’s capacity to intervene. No longer.

As we begin the countdown to Day-Zero, the ground has shifted. While we must still do everything possible to prevent this ghastly eventuality (and we still can if EVERYBODY abides by the new water restrictions of 50 litres per person per day), my focus has shifted to overseeing plans for the day the taps run dry – and the weeks that follow. The province has a mandate to manage provincial disasters. The question that dominates my waking hours now is: When Day-Zero arrives, how do we make water accessible and prevent anarchy? And if there is any chance of still preventing it, what is it we can do?

In our most recent oversight discussions, on Friday the City outlined its Day-Zero plan as follows: One week before the six dams providing water to the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) are collectively projected to drop to 13.5%, the City will announce the date on which almost all the taps in Cape Town’s residential suburbs will be cut off.

The same may happen in other towns with a high dependency ratio on these dams – particularly Drakenstein, parts of Stellenbosch and towns on the West Coast (where we have been working very hard to reduce dependence on the Western Cape Water Supply System). If the City’s augmentation plan for Atlantis meets the deadline, it will be almost self-sufficient, and Saldanha Bay municipality has made significant progress in groundwater extraction.

Day Zero is currently projected to be 21 April. (This changes as water usage varies and other factors influence dam levels.)

It may also be delayed as the City and neighbouring towns intensify “throttling”, the process of drastically reducing water pressure in specific areas, where greatest savings can be achieved. This will inevitably mean that people in high-lying “throttled” areas may have very little water coming out of their taps, for extended periods of time, in the weeks ahead.

In weekend email correspondence with Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson, who now heads up the City’s drought response team, he indicated that plans to manage Day Zero may be substantially reviewed. But, as things currently stand, the indications are that, in less than 90 days’ time, municipal water may only be available at 200 Points of Distribution (PoDs) across the City.

The only water delivered through taps will be in informal settlements (where water is already fetched in buckets from standpipes) as well as certain business districts, the boundaries of which are currently being demarcated. Nor is there any detail yet on what measures will be in place to prevent abuse of access to places where water is still available.

However, according to the City’s current plan, most of Cape Town’s 4-million citizens will have to fetch water from a PoD. The maximum allocation will be 25 litres per person per day, distributed on the assumption that an average family comprises four persons. There is a proposal that larger families should register and provide proof of additional numbers through identity documents. Registration of household numbers above four will also be essential for the punitive water tariffs for exceeding the water-use limits, which will accompany the level 6B water restrictions.

The City has not yet revealed details of how allocation will be managed at the collection points, but the current proposal is to do so on the basis of municipal accounts where the number of users would be registered, and the person collecting the water would have to provide proof of identification and the registered number of persons in the household.

A sophisticated system will be necessary to prevent water theft through “double dipping”. These logistics must still be resolved in the short time remaining.

Consider this scenario: If every family sends one person to fetch their water allocation, about 5,000 people will congregate at each POD every day. That creates a logistical nightmare of its own. In addition, it will be impossible for individuals to carry, by hand, 100 litres of water allocated for a family of four every day. So provision will have to be made for transport. The City has not yet given details of how the traffic will be managed. I am awaiting a full operations plan, including personnel requirements, security, infrastructure and budgets.

As things stand, the challenge exceeds anything a major City has had to face anywhere in the world since the Second World War or 9/11. I personally doubt whether it is possible for a city the size of Cape Town to distribute sufficient water to its residents, using its own resources, once the underground waterpipe network has been shut down.

We have to look at supplementary methods, in partnership with the many private sector corporations that deliver their products to the farthest reaches of this province, in every community, every day.

South African Breweries have been the first to step up to the plate. In a discussion this weekend, Mr Ricardo Tadeu, SAB’s Zone President for Africa, and Mr Des Jacobs, SABS Western Cape Regional Director, committed the Newlands brewery to fill 12-million quart bottles with water (instead of beer) from the famous spring (whose water is normally used to brew beer). The SAB network will deliver water to retail outlets in designated areas of greatest need over several weeks. The bottling of water will have to start as soon as possible to ensure sufficient stockpiles.

Work is well under way between SAB and the South African Bureau of Standards to ensure that the bottled water will meet the required quality standard. Production will begin soon, and the bottles, labelled “Water, Not for Sale”, will be delivered at outlets when Day Zero arrives. Consumers will pay R1 for each “quart” (as South Africans still refer to the large beer bottle) which is about three quarters of a litre, with a maximum limit per person. The R1 is the cost of the bottle’s deposit. The water itself is free. When the bottle is returned, empty, it will be replaced, full, at no charge.

We are in discussion with the South African National Defence Force to store water supplies at military bases for safety.

There is a lot more we must do in partnership with the extensive retail distribution networks to deliver water to places people routinely visit during the course of the day – like supermarkets and cafes. During the days ahead I will be meeting representatives of major retailers and courier companies to discuss details of an emergency water distribution network in order to provide a massive multiplier effect for the PoDs. We will work closely with the City’s team preparing for Day Zero. Together we will have to step up public communication massively, so that no one is in doubt about the threat the City faces.

Up till now, over 50% of residents have ignored entreaties to save water.

Apart from water distribution, there are many other foreseeable crises associated with dry taps, such as conflict over access to water, theft of water, and other criminal acts associated with water, not to mention the outbreak of disease.

Our Provincial Disaster Management team has been meeting weekly since January 2017, and daily since 8 November (with a short Christmas break) to work out a detailed plan for every provincial department in the case of this eventuality.

At our Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, we will meet a high-level delegation from the South African Police Service, to discuss their contingency plans for the run-up to and aftermath of Day Zero. In such a disaster, normal policing will be entirely inadequate.

Today (Monday morning), I will lead the Provincial Disaster Management team in discussions with National Disaster Management Centre, under the leadership of Dr Mmphaka Tau. This will not be our first discussion. We had an in-depth engagement in November 2017 to prepare for an eventuality we still hoped, at the time, would be possible to avoid. Tomorrow’s meeting will also be attended by the State Security Agency, the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, all at a very high level.

In order to deploy these national agencies, we need the co-operation of National Government, which would be greatly facilitated by the declaration of a national State of Disaster. I have therefore written to President Zuma, motivating why he should declare a national state of disaster, well before we hit Day Zero. That would enable the SSA, the SANDF and the SAPS to formulate a shared plan with ourselves and the private sector to distribute water, defend storage facilities, deal with potential outbreaks of disease, and keep the peace.

Even if we manage a disaster of this magnitude reasonably smoothly, our economy will take a terrible knock. It already has.

In November 2017, Wesgro, the Western Cape’s economic development and investment agency, facilitated a meeting with 40 major corporations in Cape Town, to discuss our approach to the water crisis.

The province’s economy is supported by two major water intensive sectors: tourism and agriculture. Between them, they employ about 600,000 people who (at a conservative estimate of four persons per household) support almost three-million people. One of our major priorities has been to keep them employed. The crisis associated with large-scale job losses and hunger would greatly exacerbate the catastrophe of dry taps.

Fortunately, both these sectors have been very pro-active, and have worked hard to cut water usage and keep people in jobs. Agriculture, under the leadership of Agri-Western Cape, immediately agreed to cut its allotted water take-off per farm by 40% – and now by 60%. They have trimmed buds off vines and trees to reduce the plants’ need for water, dividing farms up into sections that will still be irrigated, and those that will not. A fly-over reveals the brown, barren strips along those that can still get water. High technology systems, introduced by the Western Cape’s Department of Agriculture, can assist in saving significant amounts of water by targeting available irrigation in the right amount, exactly where it is need.

The province has allocated over R100-million to help keep people employed and provide feed for livestock, with a particular emphasis on new and emerging farmers. The rest of the agricultural industry, countrywide, has done everything possible to rally in support of drought-stricken farmers, sending feed and other support. Without them, our agricultural sector would have been far closer to collapse. This year, we are expecting the lowest harvest in decades, which will cause projected losses of R1-billion to the sector and deprive 50,000 seasonal workers of their jobs.

This also has a knock-on effect on agri-processing sub-sectors, such as fruit and vegetable processors, juicers and canners, who obtain most of their raw produce from the Western Cape, both in terms of reduced volumes and quality.

The hotel sector has also been innovative, reducing their water usage by 50% in comparison with the situation three years ago. They have removed plugs from baths (to force guests into showers fitted with low-flow showerheads), and emphasised the importance of saving water. Hotels on the Cape Town Foreshore, which have basements below sea level, have to pump out seawater constantly and return it to the sea. Now they are busy installing their own desalination plants, at great cost, so that they can use basement water for consumption. After a meeting with the tourism sector to discuss the drought last week, a major hotel group reported that their desalination systems, for hotel use, could be up and running within two months. So, we continue to encourage tourists to visit Cape Town. Leading hotels will ensure that their water preparedness will be communicated on their websites.

To relieve the pressure on the municipal water system, local residents who can afford it might well book into hotel rooms that have water security and spare bed capacity, for the duration of the crisis, where their water needs would be met independently of municipal water. At the same time this would help offset the industry’s anticipated losses due to international cancellations, as Day Zero looms larger.

The Department of Economic Development has, for many months, been running a focused programme, called Water for the Economy, working with a range of water-intensive sectors to find ways of saving water while remaining economically sustainable. One major building and renovation company, for example, has fitted water carts to their trucks, to carry non-potable water which is well-suited for most of the functions for which it is required.

There are many similar examples, across different sectors. Supported by Green Cape (with a mandate from the province and the City to ensure the green economy drives growth and jobs), businesses and municipalities are better managing their water use and finding alternative water sources. Much work has also been done to support companies in preparing their “business continuity plans” in the event of a Day Zero. We need the City’s private sector network to engage actively with all their employees to reduce water use and to understand the link between saving water and saving their jobs.

And what of the provincial government departments, particularly education and health, for which we are directly responsible?

Work began early in 2017 on “business continuity plans” to ensure that these facilities can continue functioning in the event of Day Zero. Most critical are hospitals and clinics, where our plans are far advanced. We have focused specifically on drilling boreholes, and by the time Day Zero arrives, all hospitals and clinics will have been secured to continue functioning.

Schools are also a key focus and a major challenge. It is essential to keep them open, both so that education can continue and that children can be kept safe at a very challenging time. There are over 900 schools in the Cape Town Metro, of which 423 have boreholes. Some of these produce potable water, and for the rest, plans are advanced to link borehole water to the schools’ sanitation reticulation system, which will then be cut off from municipal water. It is obviously essential to provide water to schools without boreholes. But this must still be finalised.

One option is to establish a system of “sub-PoDS” where tankers could collect water for distribution to key institutions, such as schools. And when the immediate crisis is over, we will have to institute a long-term programme of managed aquifer recharge, to put back the water we have extracted.

Every provincial government department has a detailed business continuity plan in the event of Day Zero.

But although it now looks likely, it is a worst-case scenario. We can still avoid Day Zero by the skin of our teeth if every consumer cuts water usage down to a maximum of 50 litres per day. Here is a diagram of what can be done with that amount of water.

No person in Cape Town should be flushing potable water down a toilet any more. At home, for example, we turned off the tap of the toilet’s cistern, store grey water in the bath, and scoop it out to fill the cistern when needed. No one should be showering more than twice a week now. There is nothing wrong with a daily scrub, using the old-fashioned “skottel en waslap” method, with which many of us grew up.

It will also be essential that the City’s water augmentation projects come on stream timeously, but these cannot save us from Day Zero in 2018, without a significant reduction in usage. If everything goes according to schedule, augmentation schemes will, by the end of April, produce between 120-million to 150-million litres per day – either from ground water extraction or from small-scale desalination. This figure falls into perspective when we consider our failure to bring consumption down below 500-million litres per day.

As the drought is likely to persist, we will have to go for large-scale desalination in the years ahead, and we are grateful to all those entrepreneurs and consortia who have come forward to make proposals in this regard. We will follow them all up, to supplement the planning and feasibility studies we have done to date, in order to make sure we find the best long-term solution, while following due process of law (including the complex tender regulations). And we will do whatever is possible to compel national government to fulfil its mandate of providing bulk water infrastructure and supply.

However, in the short term, there is only one solution: We have to save water as if our lives depend on it. Because they do. DM

Despite progress made over the past few decades, about 767 million people globally continue to live in extreme poverty, half of them in sub-Saharan Africa.

The majority of the world’s poor and hungry live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their survival. However, their livelihoods are often constrained by limited access to resources, services, technologies, markets and economic opportunities, lowering their productivity and income. Fast population growth, increasing conflicts, civil insecurity and climate change exacerbate the situation, as the poor are invariably the most vulnerable.

In 2013, the African Union convened a High-Level Meeting on Renewed Partnership for a Unified Approach to End Hunger in Africa and signed a declaration to end hunger on the continent by 2025, by sustaining the momentum behind the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). The outcome of this meeting was a precursor to the 2014 Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods. Amongst others, this Declaration committed to end hunger and malnutrition by 2025 and ensure mutual accountability for results through a biennial review and reporting progress.

The Inaugural Biennial Report reveals that commitment number 3, “Ending hunger by 2025”, is not on track, with a score of 1.62 compared to a benchmark of 3.17 in 2017.

The report is in line with the UN publication The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017, which recognized that despite a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. It also highlighted that this trend is closely associated with the increase in conflicts in Africa, exacerbated by climate-related shocks, drought and other factors that threaten to reduce the agricultural and livestock productivity of the African continent.

The warning sign that Africa needs to step up its efforts and find new ways working with its partners towards the ambition of ending hunger in Africa by 2025 is thus clear.

The commitment to end hunger was further strengthened by the adoption of the Africa 2063 Agenda, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, SDG 2 aims to “End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.” Several countries in Africa, as well as their regional economic entities, have made considerable progress to align agricultural and other policies, programmes and investments related to food security and nutrition with the Zero Hunger vision of the 2014 Malabo Declaration and SDG 2.

However, the continent as a whole faces considerable challenges in attaining these goals while facing low agricultural productivity, climate change and environmental degradation, as well as high youth unemployment. Recent estimates on food security and nutrition reveal that the prevalence of undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 20.8 percent in 2015 to 22.7 percent in 2016; in concrete terms, this amounts to about 224 million people who are undernourished, up from 200 million in 2015.

Ending hunger is both a moral and an economic imperative. With strategic concerted efforts, it is a dream that is possible by 2030. It is, therefore, important to keep up the momentum and redouble current efforts in a coordinated, integrated and aligned approach to enhance food security and curb malnutrition.

A renewed call for action

Key challenges in achieving the SDGs include addressing food insecurity and undernourishment in Africa. Doing so will require:","In 2013, the African Union convened a High-Level Meeting on Renewed Partnership for a Unified Approach to End Hunger in Africa and signed a declaration to end hunger on the continent by 2025, by sustaining the momentum behind the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

As he prepares to start his new job he took part in a special flight with members of the public who had paid 6,000 euros per ticket for an out-of-this-world experience.

For me, it is interesting while waiting maybe for the chance to go back into space.It allows me to remain active.It's still an incredible experience even as a pilot, a lot of people are lucky enough to do this, I am at the crossroad of my life as a pilot of Airbus, and my life as an astronaut now.

The aircraft, unique in Europe, has been adapted to perform parabolic flights that enables the plane to rise 50 degrees, then making it descend in the same way, to recreate the conditions of weightlessness.

These flights, specifically for scientific research, are sometimes open to the general public.

ROME, Apr 11 2018 (IPS) - The United Nations, which is battling some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, still remains focused on one of its equally daunting undertakings: how to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.



But the latest figures released in a joint study by the European Union (EU), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) highlight the gravity of the situation just last year alone when some 124 million people in 51 countries faced acute food insecurity — 11 million more than in 2016 (even while the number of people living on the edge of starvation and hunger remains at 815 million worldwide).

The 2017 increase, according to the ‘Global Report on Food Crises’, is largely attributable to new or intensified conflicts and insecurity in Myanmar, north-east Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan and Yemen.

Prolonged drought conditions have also triggered poor harvests in countries already facing high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, both in eastern and southern Africa.

And UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres warned last January that hunger is on the rise the world over, with Africa registering the highest rates.

The Secretary General said agricultural and livestock productivity in Africa was under threat largely due to conflict and climate change. He added, “climatic shocks, environmental degradation, crop and livestock price collapse and conflict are all interlinked”.

Still, the United Nations seems determined to work towards its targeted goal of Zero Hunger by 2030. But how feasible is this?

Asked about the impediments facing that goal, Dr Marta Antonelli, Research Programme Manager at the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition Foundation (BCFN), told IPS reducing the number of chronically undernourished people in Africa is one of the most urgent challenges that the world needs to face.

She pointed out that food insecurity, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, is related to a variety of interconnected factors, such as extreme poverty, un-diversified livelihoods, weak institutions and governance, and, especially, adverse climatic conditions and social conflicts.

“Climate change and severe extreme weather events could have a tremendous impact on crop yields, livestock, fish stocks and therefore affect farmer’s incomes (especially subsistence smallholder farmers) who become more vulnerable to food insecurity.”

Dr Antonelli said measures to tackle hunger in Africa include the harmonisation of governance of food security, sustainability and nutrition; building institutional responses to reduce extreme poverty and inequalities; supporting more efficient agricultural systems; ICTs and technology innovation.

Additionally, it also includes supporting farmers to diversify livelihoods and reduce vulnerability; restoring land and increasing integrated land and water management to improve harvests; identification of strategies for building resilience to shocks through adaptation to climate change, institutional response mechanisms; and finally monitoring and reporting of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through generation and sharing of reliable data.

The BCFN Foundation, a non-profit, independent think tank working for food sustainability, addresses today’s major food related issues with a multidisciplinary approach — from the environmental, economic and social perspective. That goal is to secure the wellbeing and health of people and the planet.

Asked what role BCFN can play, as part of its contribution to a resolution of the food crisis, Dr Antonelli said the coexistence of hunger and obesity, the overexploitation of natural resources and food loss and waste: these are the three paradoxes identified by the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition Foundation.

According to BCFN, it recognises three imbalances that beset the global food system: food waste (nearly 1/3 of world food production), hunger in the face of epidemic levels of obesity (2.1 billion people impacted), and unsustainable agricultural systems (1/3 of world grain production is used for animal feed, foodstuffs are used for first generation biofuels instead of feeding people.

Dr Antonelli said: “Since 2009, we use a multidisciplinary approach to study and analyse the relationship between food and scientific, economic, social and environmental factors. Through research, dissemination and public engagement, our contribution to shift towards more sustainable food systems includes the Nutritional and Environmental Double Pyramid, the Milan Protocol, the publication of Eating Planet.”

Moreover, in 2016, BCFN launched the Food Sustainability Index (FSI), developed by The Economist Intelligence Unit with the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition. The FSI analyses, ranks and maps 34 countries worldwide on a range of indicators, from food waste per capita to agricultural biodiversity and CO2 emissions from agriculture, to determine the sustainability of their food systems.

“We fund young research through the ‘BCFN YES!’, a contest open to PhD candidates and young research fellows around the world. The award is given in recognition and support of innovative projects on food and sustainability. We also believe that involving media and journalists is also pivotal to shed a light simultaneously on local and global food sustainability, inform people on supply chains and inform their choices.”

For this reason, the BCFN launched in 2016 the Food Sustainability Media Award, which invites journalists, bloggers, freelancers and individuals to submit work, either published or unpublished, on food safety, sustainability, agriculture and nutrition. (www.goodfoodmediaaward.org).

BCFN has also developed a series of educational programmes for school children and the MOOC on “Sustainable Food Systems: a Mediterranean Perspective” realised in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Mediterranean with SDG Academy and The University of Siena, with a major educational purpose.

It consists of a series of pre-recorded lectures, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and deals with environmental and climate-related challenges basing upon Mediterranean experience, how sustainable farming systems is being utilized as a roadmap for positive action and implementation of Sustainable Development Goals.

Asked about the importance of food sustainability– including eliminating waste and reducing obesity – as a key factor in reaching the 2030 goal, Dr Antonelli said the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs establish a global set of objectives for all countries in the world to be achieved by the year 2030.

SDGs range from the eradication of poverty and hunger, to the need to act for climate mitigation, to the promotion of education and gender equality, to preserving natural resources such as water in sufficient quantity and quality for human needs.

Food access, utilisation, availability, quality and sustainability are at the core of all SDGs and represent a pre-requisite to implement the 2030 Agenda in all countries in the world.

Agriculture accounts for one third of global GhG emissions, cover 38% of the world’s land surface (an area still in expansion), accounts for 70% of water withdrawals and 80% of desertification.

The number of hungry people, she pointed out, is rising again and exceeded 815 million in 2016; overweight and nutrition challenges affect two billion people both in the North and the South of the world; and about one third of the food produced for human consumption gets lost or is wasted.

“We cannot transform our world without fixing the food system first.”

Asked about the countries making the most progress in the Food Sustainability Index, she said the FSI Index shows that, when defining food sustainability by looking at country’s performance in sustainable agriculture, nutritional challenges and food loss and waste, the top scoring countries are France, Japan, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Italy, South Korea and Hungary.

The presence or absence of sound and well-implemented policies is fundamental in shaping the score of the countries analysed. Generally speaking, high human development is moderately correlated with higher sustainability of food systems.

The analysis performed in 2017 on the Mediterranean countries revealed that the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries are those struggling the most in achieving sustainable food system, especially in the area of food loss and waste, whereas they perform relatively better across the nutritional challenges indicators.","UN’s Zero Hunger Goal Remains a Daunting ChallengeROME, Apr 11 2018 (IPS) - The United Nations, which is battling some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, still remains focused on one of its equally daunting undertakings: how to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.

Agroecology Key Element to Zero Hunger and Food Security

By Jaya Ramachandran

ROME (IDN) – More than enough food is produced in the world to feed everyone, yet 815 million people go hungry, according to FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. How to ensure that a growing global population – projected to rise to around 10 billion by 2050 – will have enough food to meet their nutritional needs, is therefore one of the greatest challenges the world faces. Experts see in agroecology a solution.

Agroecology, they say, can help transition to sustainable food and agriculture systems that ensure food security and nutrition for all, provide social and economic equity and conserve biodiversity and the ecosystem services on which agriculture depends.

Family farmers must remain central to bringing agroecology to scale, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva stressed in his closing remarks to the Second International Agroecology Symposium from April 3-5 at FAO in Rome.

""It's time to scale up the implementation of agroecology,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""We have succeeded in moving from talking about what is agroecology, to now having specific program targets to be achieved in the next few years, and strong support from civil society and those governments who have worked hard to make this symposium a success,"" he added.

""When we speak of agroecology, we are not speaking of strictly technical matters. I would like to stress the social aspect, so when we say that we are going to strengthen the role of agroecology in FAO's work, we are saying that we are going to strengthen the role of family and small-scale farmers, fisher folk, pastoralists, women and youth,"" he said.

The FAO Director-General also highlighted the Decade of Family Farming (2019-2028) and the Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) as opportunities to raise awareness about the valuable link between family farming, agroecology and sustainable development.

The Symposium underscored the need to recognize that scaling up agroecology is a key element to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), endorsed by the international community in September 2015. Goal 2 aims to ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.""

The Symposium brought together more than 700 participants with representatives from 72 governments, around 350 civil society and other non-governmental groups, and 6 UN organizations.

The Symposium Chair Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias emphasized in his summary that ""Agroecology offers multiple benefits"" – including for increasing food security and resilience, boosting livelihoods and local economies, diversifying food production and diets, promoting health and nutrition, safeguarding natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystem functions, improving soil fertility and soil health, adapting to and mitigating climate change, and preserving local cultures and traditional knowledge systems.

""It is critical that legal and regulatory frameworks are implemented in a way that ensures transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems based on agroecology, and respects, protects and fulfills farmers' rights and access to productive resources such as land, water and seeds.""

The Chair's Summary also drafts a way forward including a list of ""urgently needed"" commitments from stakeholders. Governments are called on to develop policy and legal frameworks to promote and support agroecology and sustainable food systems, and to remove ""perverse incentives"" for unsustainable agriculture.

The Summary calls on FAO to develop a detailed 10-year action plan for agroecology and to begin implementing the Scaling up Agroecology Initiative.

Consumers and citizens are urged to act as agents of change in the food system to promote responsible consumption. Donors are asked to increase long-term funding to agroecology, while academia and research organizations are encouraged to increase research on agroecology.

On the sidelines of the Symposium, the World Future Council (WFC) with FAO and IFOAM – Organics International kicked off a global contest for the visionary policies that create enabling environments for agroecology, the 2018 Future Policy Award. The winners will be recognized in a ceremony at FAO in Rome later in 2018.

The Future Policy Award 2018 is supported by the FAO, the World Future Council, IFOAM-Organics International with the assistance of Green Cross International, DO-IT - Dutch Organic International Trade and Sekem Group (Egypt).

Every year, the most visionary policies tackling humankind’s most pressing challenges are commended with the Future Policy Award (FPA), the only global award hitherto that recognises policies rather than people. The World Future Council has awarded this annual prize since 2010 in partnership with UN agencies.

“This year’s Future Policy Award will reveal proven solutions that make sustainable agriculture possible. The World Future Council is determined to further cooperate with FAO in order to identify and share the best policies for advancing agroecology in the interest of future generations. It is critical that we learn from the policies that are already making an impact,’’ says Alexandra Wandel, Director of the World Future Council.

“World Leaders and the UN General Assembly recognise the potential of agroecology to achieve healthy nutrition for all and to address social injustice, climate change and biodiversity loss”, notes Peggy Miars, World Board President of IFOAM – Organics International. “We see it happen in numerous countries where the policy framework gets it right. Let’s showcase and reward these innovative policies!” [IDN-InDepthNews - 06 April 2018]

8,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/305369-the-zero-hunger-challenge,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The News International,The zero-hunger challenge,"According to the latest estimate, there are still nearly half a billion people who either go hungry or are undernourished in the countries that fall within Asia and the Pacific. Some 490 million people do not obtain the daily nutrients that are required to lead a healthy and productive life.

The region made a considerable amount of progress during the 1990s and 2000s in dealing with the problems created by malnutrition and hunger. But in recent years, we have found that the fight against hunger has slowed down in recent years and, in some cases, its effects have been reversed.

This comes as bad news for all of us because various governments had pledged to wipe out hunger, in all its forms, by 2030. In other words, in little more than 12 years, no one should suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The reality is that we have 152 months (give or take) or around 4,560 days to achieve this task.

As an economist, I have done the math that can guide us in handling this issue. As per my own estimates, we must pull 107,456 people out of hunger every day in Asia and the Pacific. So, this means we need to help around 107,000 or more people on a daily basis for a long time until our target is met.

Of course, we must do this against the backdrop of limited natural resources; climate change; an aging populations; and urbanisation. Hunger must also be eradicated amid conflicts; natural disasters; and humanitarian crises.

The growing demand for protein-rich foods can be viewed as one factor that can help defeat hunger. But in some countries, this trend has led to obesity, which must be tackled simultaneously. After all, the challenge is to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, nutritious foods at all times.

But when you consider the alarming statistics and the challenges before us, the situation appears to be depressing. But no one is ready to throw in the towel. In fact, they are willing to do just the opposite. The good news is that governments across this region are acutely aware of these challenges and aren’t giving up at any cost. They have recently reaffirmed their pledge to go the extra mile and eradicate hunger in all its forms from their respective countries.

Last week, government ministers and senior officials from 40 countries across this region came together in Fiji to provide strategic direction and assign priorities for the FAO to tackle these issues. This was the first time in more than two decades that such an event – the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC) – had been convened in the Pacific.

The passion and intensity with which discussions were held and ideas were shared was particularly striking. There was a clear edge to the talks: the effects of climate change on food and agriculture were now being realised. While the delegates engaged in productive discussions, a category-3 cyclone battered the conference venue – as if to remind delegates of the urgency of the tasks at hand.

The countries called upon the FAO to further assist them in strengthening their sector-specific contributions and help them monitor progress toward meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). They also wanted further support to integrate agriculture into their national policies, strategies and programmes for climate change and disaster risk reduction management.

To meet these SDG goals, and as part of their nationally-determined contributions, countries have highlighted the need for improved and more resilient crops; more efficient irrigation; improved animal and fisheries management; enhanced fertilisers; low-emission rice; and sustainable forest management as suitable measures that ought to be implemented.

The FAO is supporting governments to scale-up climate action for food and agriculture under the 2030 Agenda by mobilising finance and expertise at the field level and advocating for a more prominent role for food and agriculture in the global climate change agenda.

But climate change is not the only cause for concern. The countries acknowledged that food systems need to be addressed to tackle the growing rates of obesity – especially in the Pacific, where it has reached epidemic proportions. A great deal of concern was also evident because the number of people suffering from hunger has once again been on the rise in some parts of Asia. This trend has emerged after decades of reductions in the continent.

Civil society organisations that participated in the Fiji conference reminded governments that decisions made in meetings like these must be inclusive. The result must be in everyone’s best interest – particularly the most disadvantaged and food-insecure groups in society.

Adapting agriculture to climate change; improving nutrition for all; and eradicating hunger in all its forms will require teamwork. This form of teamwork was evident at the APRC. The FAO and its member countries and partners can collectively score the winning goal – the zero hunger goal. We can do this within the allotted time because we know that it isn’t impossible.

The announcement by clean growth minister Claire Perry during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) raises the possibility the UK could implement a target to reduce emissions to “net zero” by 2050, tightening the existing goal to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by that date.

Such a target would require more stringent cuts to carbon in the short as well as long term, and a much faster transformation of key parts of the economy – including energy, transport, industry and housing – than has yet been contemplated. The government’s statutory advisers would be expected to set out key choices on how this could be achieved.

Under the global Paris agreement, countries have committed to curbing temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to prevent dangerous climate change.

Such a move will require the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. The UK government pledged in 2016 to enshrine a zero target in law, but has not yet passed any legislation.

After a global scientific review of the impacts of, and action needed to keep to, a 1.5C rise is published this autumn, the UK’s climate advisers will be asked to review the country’s 2050 target, Perry said in a speech on Tuesday.

After the report, she said: “We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets.”

The committee recently suggested the UK would have to meet the net-zero target by 2045-50 in order to do its bit to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5C.

A temperature rise of 1.5C is seen by some countries, such as low lying islands at risk of rising sea levels, as the limit beyond which their very existence is threatened.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “For a safe climate we need all governments to aim for cutting pollution to net zero levels by 2050.

“This decision to review Britain’s long-term climate target sends a strong message to the EU and other big economies that London is committed to the Paris agreement, and now it’s time they too considered what more they can do.”

Ways of meeting the net-zero target could include investing in projects to grow trees and restore soils, to take up greater carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as more controversial measures such as investing in emissions reduction projects overseas. Even with such methods, the UK is likely to have to bring forward targets on phasing out diesel and petrol engines, and expand renewable energy generation and, potentially, nuclear power.

Many actions under Conservative-led governments since 2010, however, have dismayed climate campaigners and may have to be reconsidered. These include the failure to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, limits on renewable energy, the scrapping of carbon capture and storage projects and tax breaks for fossil fuels.

John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the review was extremely important and could provide a “valuable lead” for other countries.

“The data shows that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency.

“Fossil-fuel dependent cars and vans need to be removed from sale by 2030, a step-change in energy efficiency standards in our construction industry should be prioritised, and the government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget,” he added.

The government’s announcement was welcomed by others at the Commonwealth summit, where climate change has been seen as one of the key issues under discussion. Nearly half of the Commonwealth nations are classed as “small island developing states”, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.

Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which currently holds the presidency of the UN’s climate forum, told the meeting: “I am encouraged by Britain’s undertaking to review its climate targets with a view to increasing ambition. The [targets] we all promised to make in the Paris agreement should be setting high standards for the rest of the world to follow. But just as importantly, we in the Commonwealth can show how cooperation based on trust can supply the finance, technology and skilled resources to deliver the necessary transformation in our economies.”","The UK is to review its long-term target to cut climate emissions as part of global efforts to curb rising temperatures, the government has announced.

Introduction

THE ZERO HUNGER CHALLENGE (ZHC) is an international call for action made by the United Nations (UN) towards a vision of a world without hunger. It is fully aligned to the 2030 Agenda and reflects the five elements from within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The zero hunger challenge is also aligned to the Africa Union Commission’s Agenda 2063 on ‘The Africa we Want’.

Lesotho is generally food deficit, hence addressing hunger is imperative and a top priority in the country’s development agenda. Overall, a large part of the population remains exposed to situations of chronic food and nutrition insecurity, especially the rural population, which is heavily dependent on subsistence farming and other rural non-farm activities.

Therefore, the Government of Lesotho (GoL)’s commitment to eradication of hunger and undernutrition is infixed in the national vision 2020 and elaborated in the 2017 Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP).

Achieving zero hunger requires integrated approaches that respond to the multiple, interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. To respond to the Zero Hunger Challenge, the Government of Lesotho (GoL) commissioned the Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR). The purpose of the ZHSR was to support national efforts to accelerate actions towards eliminating food insecurity and malnutrition. The specific objectives of the review were to:

Conduct a comprehensive review of the food security situation in Lesotho, including assessment of the adequacy of the strategies, policies, programs, institutional capabilities meant to support food security and nutrition for vulnerable groups and the poor in the country. Highlight the progress made and identify the challenges Lesotho must overcome if the country is to achieve zero hunger in line with the targets of SDG 2 and the country’s national commitments. Recommend how policies, programmes and strategies can be adjusted or adapted to have a food security or nutrition impact. Initiate the development of a national Zero Hunger Roadmap.

The ZHSR is framed within the pillars of SDG2 or zero hunger: (i) Access to Adequate Food and Healthy Diets for All People All Year Round (ii) An End to Malnutrition and All its Forms (iii) All Food Systems are Sustainable (iv) Double Smallholder Productivity and Income and (v) Zero Loss or Waste of Food. While the analysis is informed by key national policies and strategic frameworks geared towards addressing food and nutrition insecurity, the 2017 Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) is the overarching framework for the implementation of the ZHSR recommendations.

The Hunger Challenge in Lesotho

With a Global Hunger Index (GHI) of 24.1, Lesotho indicates a serious food security situation. The rising number of undernourished people continues to pose serious challenges in the country. As a result, the 2017 Global Hunger Report ranked Lesotho 80 out of 119 countries that were assessed. This is higher than Swaziland (71) and South Africa (55) but lower than Botswana (81), Namibia (87) and Malawi (80). According to the situational analysis, other key food and nutrition security issues identified within the zero hunger pillars include:

Access to Adequate Food and Healthy Diets All Year Round: The main source of food for the majority of Basotho population is own crop production; livestock products; remittances through economic migration, labour exchange and direct market purchases supplemented with the Government social protection interventions. Heavy reliance on food imports makes Lesotho susceptible to high food prices which increases pressure on vulnerable households’ food and nutrition security.

Low-income earners and the poor especially the rural population struggle to meet their minimum daily requirements for food intake as they can only access poor quality foods with low micronutrient content. The most affected households are those relying on farming with low earnings, herding, informal business or casual labour for most of their incomes; those headed by women and children, with high age dependency ratio; those with fewer employment opportunities and few assets. Overlying the food access situation is the high prevalence of HIV in the country.

An end to Malnutrition and all its Forms: Lesotho is currently experiencing the triple burden of malnutrition - under and over nutrition and micronutrient deficiency across all age groups. Although the prevalence of underweight children has marginally improved, low birth weight remains steady at 9.4 percent. Wasting is at 3 percent, which is an improvement relative to the 6 per cent and 5 per cent wasting attained in 2004 and 2009 respectively. Stunting at 33.2 percent remains a serious health challenge. Obesity is a growing challenge with 7 percent in children under the age of five years and 45 percent of women and 12 percent of men aged 15 to 49 years recorded as obese. The other challenge worsening nutrition outcomes in the country is the low intake of micronutrients such as Vitamins and Iron-folic acid. An underlying challenge is the poor access to improved sanitation. On the positive end, the proportion of mothers practicing exclusive breastfeeding has increased almost two-fold from 36 (2004) to 67 percent (2014).

All Food Systems are Sustainable: Climate change in Lesotho is likely to cause significant impacts on agriculture and general livelihoods. Land degradation is a pressing sustainable system issue. The effects of land degradation associated with soil erosion have already reduced the productive capacity of Lesotho’s croplands and rangelands. This will continue to constrain efforts to improve production efficiencies and total production in the face of climate change impacts. The cumulative effect of landcover losses from degradation and soil erosion ultimately reduces the country’s capacity to achieve zero hunger.

Double Small-Scale Productivity and Income: Lesotho continues to be a net importer of food to meet the needs of its people. In good harvest years, Lesotho is only able to meet roughly 30 percent of its annual cereal requirements. More than 70 percent of the population in rural Lesotho is engaged in agriculture and the performance of the sector plays an important role in their wellbeing. However, arable land is below 10 percent of total land area and the country utilizes only half of this land, with implications on resource use efficiency. Domestic food production has concentrated on three main cereal crops: maize, wheat and sorghum and their productivity has been on a decline. Maize dominates local cereal cultivation with 70-80 percent of total national cereal production. The low levels of maize production and yields (on average 0.5 MT/hectare) are primarily due to Lesotho’s high cereal production costs and other factors such as climate change and land degradation.

Adapt All Food Systems to Eliminate Loss or Waste of Food: This pillar focuses on minimizing food losses during production, storage and transport, and waste of food by retailers and consumers; empowering consumer choice; commitments by producers, retailers and consumers within all nations. According to the African Postharvest Information System (APHIS), Lesotho’s Post Harvest Losses (PHLs) for maize have been fluctuating over eleven years, between 2004 and 2015 across districts. For example, in Maseru post-harvest losses for maize were recorded at 2509 tonnes in 2004 compared to 2589 in 2015. The underlying constraints in measuring the losses and waste of food globally, has been lack of consensus in definitions and underdeveloped methodologies.

Key Strategic Gaps and Challenges

The following key strategic gaps and challenges were identified:

Weak enforcement of policies: While the country has a relatively developed enabling policy environment for food and nutrition security programming, the enforcement and implementation of these policies, strategies and plans remain problematic. To implement good policies and programmes that bring change will require effective public institutions and serious commitment by senior policy makers, and government. The weak implementation of policies and programmes is due to the absence of implementation frameworks and regulations and this is the major underlying constraint.

Coordination and implementation challenges: The major limiting factor has been the ad-hoc and uncoordinated manner in which policies and programmes have been implemented. While the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO) is mandated with coordinating food and nutrition programmes in the country it lacks the capacity for coordination.

There are also many structural, financial and technical challenges that stifle the operation of FNCO. These include: lack of coordinating skills, and management skills, lack of communication facilities such as internet connectivity, telephones, computers etc. Furthermore, FNCO operates within a meagre budget and depends on donor support to carry its mandate.

Weak decentralisation process: There are shortages of skills within the civil service to implement demand-led, marketoriented development, which is the focus of the Government and development partners. There is manpower as well as technical and critical skills shortages to undertake food and nutrition security activities particularly when it comes to nutritionists.

Insufficient/unavailability of nutrition data: The major gap here refers mainly to unavailability of data for monitoring of nutrition programming. This is against the absence of a functional nutrition surveillance or early warning system. At its best, the NSS collects, analyses and disseminates information on nutritional status on a quarterly basis; identify areas and groups at risk of malnutrition; and issue early warning to relevant stakeholders on nutrition related problems. However, there are data quality issues that are of concern and need to be addressed.

Weak monitoring and evaluation: Without strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks linked to the project and programme objectives with solid qualitative and quantitative indicators, nutrition and food security will not be achieved.

During the stakeholders’ discussions it was found that there are places where such frameworks do not exist and where they exist, they are not followed with sincerity.

Recommendations

Based on the situational analysis and gaps identified in policy making and programme implementation, the following strategic and specific recommendations needed to achieve zero hunger by 2030 by the GoL and its development partners are made:

Addressing the policy and institutional landscape

The first recommendations entail strengthening development and implementation of food security and nutrition related policies through a number of mechanisms that include: review of the constitution to make food and nutrition security one of the fundamental human rights; endorse and implement the long-outstanding decentralization policy, and its implementation mechanisms and finalize the Food Quality Control and Improvement Standards. Furthermore, there’s need for enhancing multi-sectoral coordination and implementation by engaging multiple ministries, agencies, other stakeholders (e.g., donors, civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, development partners and the private sector. Finally, enhance the capacity of FNCO for multi-sectoral and stakeholder coordination and leadership. This will also require building capacity of the institution through skills development and training.

Sector - Specific Recommendations

In improving access to adequate food all year round, the GoL should strengthen procurement and audit controls, and public financial management systems to address over-pricing of goods and services. Social protection has a positive impact on food and nutrition security, the systems should be strengthened and the transfers expanded in coverage ensuring it covers all the vulnerable populations.

To address high stunting levels in Lesotho and micronutrient deficiencies for sustained improvements in nutritional outcomes, there is need to scale up the implementation of multi sectoral evidence based, high impact, cost effective nutrition interventions as well as the integration and linkages across multiple sectors and development programs that have indirect impacts on nutritional status. There is also need to increase private sector partnerships to improve nutrition for mothers and children. Advocating for increased government investment for proven interventions to tackle malnutrition is essential. Similarly, strengthening systems to ensure effective monitoring, evaluation and knowledge management to improve nutrition policy and programming is recommended.

Building sustainable food systems will require the GoL to intensify land, water and environmental management efforts that will ensure effective forest and agroforestry management strategies that are key to climate mitigating efforts.

To boost smallholder productivity and incomes, there is need to address the following strategic issues: development of policies and legal frameworks covering livestock feed, agriculture irrigation and mechanization, rangeland management and land use policy. Alongside this is the need for reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency of policies in place such as the universal subsidy policy. Another recommendation relates to the aggregation of smallholder farmers into upgraded value chains and establish market information centres that recognize the diversity of farmers.

No tangible work has been done to understand food waste and food loss in Lesotho. The main recommendation would be the commissioning of a baseline survey that is meant to provide an overview of the subject. The survey should point to critical sectors that require detailed research.

Develop a common Lesotho Zero Hunger Road Map

Informed by the Strategic Review Report, the country should develop a common Zero Hunger Road Map that describes what actions are required, a timeframe for action, and which key partners are required for each of the zero hunger pillars.

The Road Map will constitute the primary vehicle that will be used by GoL and all stakeholders to carry out its work, and its plans and assess progress toward the most important milestones.

National action program seeks to reduce malnutrition, increase food security.

Vietnam has launched a Zero Hunger program that seeks to lower malnutrition rates and stunted growth through improved nutrition and sustainable food production.

The National Action Program Zero Hunger was launched by Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday, June 6, Vietnam News Agency reported.

It targets reducing the number of stunted children under two years old to below 20 percent nationwide and 25 percent for children in the north and the Central highlands. It also aims to get children under two years with low weight for their height or age to below 5 percent.

The program has policies supporting pregnant women and providing adequate nutrition.

It also encourages farmers to develop a sustainable food system by participating in co-operatives and production chains. This will enable households to increase production through large scale farming and gain higher incomes.

Zero Hunger will be funded by the national poverty reduction program to the tune of VND545 billion ($23.7 million) plus during the 2018-2025 period. Many ministries have been assigned to implement it.

The National Action Program on Zero Hunger follows a U.N. goal to find long term, sustainable solutions to eliminate hunger in all forms by 2030 through national food security.

Nine million Vietnamese people are still living in extreme poverty, according to a World Bank report released last April.

Vietnam's poverty rate fell by almost 4 percentage points since 2014, to 9.8 percent in 2016, but the problem is far from solved, especially among ethnic minority groups, the report said.

In Vietnam, poor people are defined as those who earn up to VND700,000 ($31) a month in rural areas and VND900,000 ($40) in cities. According to the General Statistics Office, 8 percent of families in Vietnam were living under the poverty line last year.

Official statistics show that the number of people living in hunger in the country dropped by 32 percent from the previous year to 746,100 in 2017.","Vietnam has launched a Zero Hunger program that seeks to lower malnutrition rates and stunted growth through improved nutrition and sustainable food production.

7 June 2018, Rome, Italy - Exchanges between developing countries of experiences and knowledge gained through their national hunger and poverty reduction efforts are proving to be a game changer for sustainable development, according to a roundtable discussion among experts and policymaker held at FAO.

""Under the 2030 sustainable development agenda, we all have the obligation to work to translate our political will and the resources we have available into action on the ground that lead to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger,"" said FAO Deputy-Director General Dan Gustafson during the discussions.

But while UN organizations and other international actors have a role to play in providing technical cooperation, assistance, and ideas, ""really it's the exchange of best practices, new ideas, innovations, experiences in how countries have addressed problems, and the policies and institutions they've used that will make a difference,"" he added.

The event brought together a diverse group of participants from all world regions to take a close look at the South-South model of development cooperation.

Under that model, developing countries themselves exchange resources, knowledge, and experts with one another to both build their own response capacities as well as to shape and drive their own development agendas.

Case studies from China, Ghana, Kenya and Senegal using FAO Knowledge Exchange Platforms to facilitate South-South cooperation were among the experiences discussed at the event.

Productive partnerships

Under South-South model for development cooperation, FAO and international donors like the European Union, are adopting at ""triangular"" approach -- two or more southern countries take the lead, while international partners fill in the gaps identified by the country-driven process.

China was one of the first countries to engage with FAO on South South cooperation and has over the past two decades has contributed some $80 million to FAO to support that work and mobilized over 1,000 of its own agricultural technicians.

""Only sustainable development is good development; only cooperative development is genuine development,"" said Niu Dun, China's Ambassador to FAO, said in his remarks.

""FAO's South-South and Triangular cooperation efforts provide a platform for co-development that allows countries and regions with the same objectives to have fruitful cooperation,"" he added.

Jan Tombinksi, Ambassador to FAO for the European Union -- a major support of the Organization's South-South program -- said: ""We will never achieve sustainability of development without there being an ownership of the process in countries,""

""The days of predominately North to South knowledge transfers are gone,"" Tombinksi added.

He cited FAO's Food and Nutrition Security Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) initiative, which the EU funds, as illustrating how the new approach can make a difference.

Tombinksi noted how, for example, support from FIRST helped Kenya's government build up its planning capacity and developed national agriculture development and investment plans as well as a national Food and Nutrition Security Policy.","The event brought together a diverse group of participants from all world regions to take a close look at the South-South model of development cooperation.

You’ve likely heard by now that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant over the weekend because of her ties to the Trump administration.

Stephanie Wilkinson, co-owner of the Red Hen, a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, told the Washington Post that several of her employees are gay and were not comfortable serving Sanders, who regularly defends Trump’s anti-LGBTQ policies, including his ban on transgender people in the military.

After news broke that Sanders was asked to leave the restaurant, Republicans were quick to criticize the business owners, accusing them of discrimination.

Even Donald Trump himself took aim at the restaurant:

The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

But Republican strategist Ana Navarro put it best when she tweeted:

Some who defend baker’s right to refuse service to gay couples, whine re ppl refusing service to a person who’s the face of a deceitful Administration. What’s good for the goose, is good for the Red Hen. Difference is, being gay is not a choice. Being an accomplice to Trump, is. — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 24, 2018

FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva and UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay today signed a new Memorandum of Understanding in Paris. It comes more than 70 years after the first partnership signed between the agencies.

""This new agreement opens a new chapter in the relationship between our two organizations,"" said FAO's Graziano da Silva. ""We need to work closely together to accelerate our efforts towards the goals set out under Agenda 2030.""

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay welcomed reinforced collaboration between UNESCO and FAO as two key Specialized Agencies of the UN system. ""The nexus between education, culture, food, and health is at the center of many of the challenges faced in this century"", she highlighted. ""We are committed to strengthening our collaboration in these areas to create sustainable futures for societies.""

Under the partnership, FAO and UNESCO have agreed to support the development of learning modules, teaching aids and practical sessions for agricultural secondary schools, universities and farmer field schools on food security and sustainable food systems. The agencies will also explore opportunities for nutrition education and healthy nutrition in schools.

This builds on the joint work already being carried out in South Sudan's cattle camps, where literacy and numeracy training by UNESCO is incorporated into FAO's Pastoral Field School approach. This means young people can access a formal school curriculum as well as topics on livestock management and livelihoods' diversification.

FAO and UNESCO will also develop a joint knowledge-sharing platform on the nexus between food, culture, and peace, and develop special education projects in poor, rural conflict-affected areas.

The two agencies in cooperation with international organizations, governments, and large youth organizations will develop a global platform for young people to become champions of the SDGs in their local communities, and an international award will honor outstanding contributions.

FAO will also continue work on the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems, and build on the existing cooperation with UNESCO's World Heritage Systems.

The cooperation will also further explore synergies between UNESCO's 1972 World Heritage Convention and FAO's GIAHS in the field of sustainable fisheries, wildlife conservation and protected areas, climate change, and forests. The agencies will also work to identify elements of living heritage related to agricultural heritage systems and review measures to safeguard them at the national level.","The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have renewed their partnership to boost efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including the goal of Zero Hunger.

13 August 2018, Rio de Janeiro - Improving the health of the world's soils is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger and combating climate change and its impacts, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva, today told participants of the World Congress of Soil Science.

In a video message to the event, which is being attended by more than 2,000 scientists from around the world, Graziano da Silva noted that approximately one third of the Earth's soil is degraded.

""Soil degradation affects food production, causing hunger and malnutrition, amplifying food-price volatility, forcing land abandonment and involuntary migration-leading millions into poverty,"" he said.

The FAO The Status of the World's Soil Resources report has identified 10 major threats to soil functions including soil erosion, soil nutrient imbalance, soil carbon and biodiversity losses, soil acidification, contamination, soil salinization, and soil compaction.

Graziano da Silva stressed the importance of sustainable soil management as an ""essential part of the Zero Hunger equation"" in a world where more than 815 million people are suffering from hunger and malnutrition.

Soils and climate change

""Although soils are hidden and frequently forgotten, we rely on them for our daily activities and for the future of the planet,"" the FAO Director-General said, underscoring the important role soils can play to support efforts by countries to mitigate or adapt to a changing climate.

In particular, he pointed to the potential of soils for carbon sequestration and storage, which has been documented in a global soil organic carbon map released by FAO. ""Maintaining and increasing soil carbon stock should become a priority,"" Graziano da Silva said.

He also noted how soils act as filters for contaminants, preventing their entry into the food chain and reaching water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, but that this potential is limited when contamination exceeds the capacity of soils to cope with pollution.

Global Soil Partnership

In his message, Graziano da Silva pointed to the Global Soil Partnership in which FAO works with governments and other partners to build technical capacity and exchange knowledge regarding sustainable soil management through the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management.

""Let us make make soils a vehicle of prosperity and peace, and show the contribution of soils to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,"" the FAO Director-General said.

27 September 2018, New York - Gender gaps in agriculture in Africa are holding back progress towards ending hunger and must be urgently addressed, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Director-General José Graziano da Silva said at a joint event with the African Union (AU) on the margins of the UN General Assembly.

""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition. For that, we must close persisting gender gaps in agriculture in Africa,"" Graziano da Silva said.

The Director-General called for better representation of women in governance mechanisms and decision-making processes, as well as adequate and equal access to land, financial resources, social protection programmes, services and opportunities for women in rural areas.

Addressing gender gaps

The findings and recommendations of the AU-FAO study The Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems were presented at the event. The Outlook is based on an extensive review of existing statistics, gender audits of 38 National Agricultural Investment Plans and in-depth country gender assessments carried out in 40 countries.

The study's recommendations call for a ""gender data revolution"" in the agri-food sector to inform sound policies and programmes, and elevating the gender benchmarks in planning, monitoring and accountability.

""We need to put in place gender targeted programmes that address women's specific vulnerabilities but also their key role in household nutrition and resilience,"" Graziano da Silva said.

""Evidence shows that when women are empowered, farms are more productive, natural resources are better managed, nutrition is improved, and livelihoods are more secure,"" he added.

The backbone of rural production

In some African countries, women account for up to 60 percent of the labour force in family farming. They are largely responsible for agricultural activities such as growing vegetables, preserving harvests and raising small ruminants such as sheep and goats. Women are also responsible for family nutrition through the preparation of meals.

Closing productivity gaps could increase food production and consumption by up to 10 percent and reduce poverty by up to 13 percent.

If women have the same access to skills, resources and opportunities as men, they can be powerful drivers in the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Empowering women in agriculture, value chains and trade will accelerate the achievement of the Malabo Commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals.

FAO and UN Women: building momentum on gender equality

On the sidelines of the event, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo met with UN Women's Deputy Executive Director Asa Regner.

UN Women recently commended FAO for its achievements so far in gender equality. In 2017, FAO met or exceeded 93 percent of all performance indicators under the UN System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

""FAO recognizes the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment - both within the Organization and in our work where gender is a major priority. We know that when women have decision-making power, all of society benefits,"" Semedo said.

""The partnership between UN Women and FAO has proven especially fruitful in turning words into concrete action. I look forward to continued, strengthened cooperation between the two agencies to unlock the potential of rural women and girls as agents of change,"" Regner said.

Equality in action

FAO and partners are providing technical support to many African countries in order to empower rural women. One example is the Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Women in Ethiopia, Liberia, Niger and Rwanda, implemented with the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and UN Women. The Programme has already enabled more than 40,000 women to receive training on improved agricultural technologies, and aims to enhance their access to financial services and markets.","""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition.

Statistics published by Reuters also show that indigenous peoples, of which there are around 5000 different communities across the world, constitute 15% of those reportedly in a position of extreme hunger and poverty.

Speaking to the Mexico City Forum on Indigenous Women, FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva commented, “indigenous women face a triple discrimination – poverty, gender and ethnicity, both within and outside their communities – making them highly vulnerable.”

It is no surprise, therefore, that the UN Food and Agriculture organisation (FAO) argue that tackling malnutrition among female indigenous communities is a critically important aspect of solving the issue of world hunger.

For this reason, the UN is working with the International Forum of Indigenous Women and the News Agency for Indigenous and Afro-descendant Women in a global campaign entitled #IndigenousWomen Visible Women to highlight the discrimination they face around the world.

Yesterday, September 5, marked the celebration of Indigenous Women Day, which saw the FAO make another special call for 30 South American leaders to join the campaign for the empowerment of indigenous women.

This year’s celebration also marked the introduction of an initiative labelled ‘violet chair,’ an urgent call to encourage the participation of indigenous women in Zero Hunger policy discussions, behind the metaphor of a seat at the table.

“We cannot be short of food…corn… plantain… these are the foods that characterise our countries,” said Indira Vargas, a member of the Ecuadorian Quechua indigenous people, in a Visible Women campaign video.

“It is important to make indigenous women visible because it is a debt that states still owe indigenous towns and particularly indigenous women,” Salvadorian Betty Elisa Perez Valiente of the Nahuat Pipil community stated in an FAO campaign video.

In Mexico, advances in this area have already been made as July’s presidential election saw the first indigenous woman, traditional healer and Nahua speaker Maria de Jesus Patricio Martinez, run as a presidential candidate.","According to the United Nations, indigenous women have higher malnutrition rates than any other social group and typically earn a lot less than men, putting them at a serious disadvantage.

Kaleemullah, 35, has frequent visits to Basic Health Unit Iskalkoo these days with his two and half years old boy Abdul Rauf, who doctors say is malnourished, to get checked and receive the prescribed Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), the Plumpy’Nut specifically designed to treat acute malnutrition without complications. However, he returns his home hopelessly, when he is told that the program of Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition has not been relaunched.

Kaleemullah’s son was one of more than one hundred beneficiaries of “Food for Peace project”, A project for acute malnourished children at UC Iskalkoo of district Kalat in Balochistan. “My son was very weak but later he recovered and could walk but the closure of government run project has again left my child exposed to danger of being malnourished,” Kaleemullah told this reporter.

Back in, 10 centers to treat malnourished children were established in district Kalat – with the support of UNICEF in nine districts. Hundreds of registered children received Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) under the project, according to Rais Manzoor Ahmed, former District Nutrition Coordinator of “Food for Peace”.

Talking to this scribe, Rais said: “We have received some death reports of malnourished children who were part of nutrition project; it is feared that their deaths have been caused due to poor health.”

“A large number of poor people wait for a such a project to feed their children. Having seen the demand of people for healthy life of their children we suggest that all the BHUs and other health centers including DHQs of Kalat and Sikandar Abad should be included in such programs since Kalat is one of the poorest districts of Balochistan and such steps can help tackle malnutrition,” Rais Manzoor suggested.

When it comes to malnutrition, Kaleemullah’s son is not the first child who has worried his family members but there are thousands of children in Balochistan who suffer from malnutrition in Balochistan, the largest province of Pakistan in terms of area with least population. The nutrition wing of the National Health Services (NHS) has reveled in a recent report that nearly 80% of the children between the age of six and 25 months do not get a balanced diet leading to stunted growth, women and children are the immediate challenges being faced by the people in Balochistan.

Poverty is marked as the chief cause of malnutrition in Balochistan. United Nations Development Program in its recent report in 2018, has ranked Balochistan the poorest province of the country. Each province has been ranked on its citizens living below the poverty lines. Which is defined living on less than the $2 a day. It should be noted that in 2014, the World Health Organization(WHO) declared a state of emergency in Balochistan in consideration of the indicators of acute malnutrition. Due to the poverty in Balochistan, children remain severely and moderately malnourished.

Provincial Manager Balochistan Nutrition Program for Mothers and Children Dr. Ali Nasir Bugti says that Malnutrition refers to the abnormal physiological condition caused by deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in energy and/or nutrients necessary for an active, healthy life. Malnutrition includes undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity. These conditions can arise separately or coexist.

Talking to the Balochistan Point, Dr. Ali Nasir Bugti said: “Major percentage of Population living in Balochistan is food insecure. Food insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life that is missing in Balochistan.”

“For people to be food secure, food must be available in sufficient quantities – whether it may be obtained from home-grown, locally grown or imported from elsewhere. Adding more he said acute food insecurity and malnutrition are any manifestation of food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration,” Dr. Ali Nasir added.

According to the nutrition experts in Balochistan, the province is confronting serious issues of malnutrition, despite utilization of wealth and projects implemented by government, national and international organizations, there has been no remarkable improvement for many years.

The World Food Program officials state that 61% population in Balochistan is food insecure, whereas out of 20 foods insecure districts 10 are in Balochistan because 40% children are underweight, 52% ate stunned and 16% are wasted. In terms of other demographics 49% women are anemic along with 57% children are anemic.

BNPMC office has shared that 54.9% of women are vitamin A deficient whereas 73.5% children are suffering from vitamin A deficiency. On the other hand, 48.9 % of women and 56.8% of children are iron deficient in Balochistan.

Nutrition experts estimate that nearly 63 percent of households in the province are food insecure and Malnutrition rates in Balochistan are alarmingly high. Currently, more than half of all children under five are stunted – have low growth for their age – and 16 percent of the population is malnourished. According to a Survey conducted by the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) in 2011, almost 58 percent of Pakistanis are food insecure.

Gul Khan Naseer, Member Executive Council Scaling Up Nutrition Civil Society Alliance (SUN-CSA) Pakistan says that People in Pakistan are facing nutrition crisis while in Balochistan almost 83 percent of households are deprived of requisite nutrition. Mostly rural communities are affected by this problem. World Food Programme (WFP) has revealed that in Pakistan two out of every three households cannot afford a proper diet and in Balochistan, the situation is worst.

Talking to the Balochistan Point Gul Khan Naseer, said: “The first 1000 days (constituting 9 months of pregnancy and the first two years of life) is a crucial period as the damages of malnutrition during this period have profound and largely irreversible effects on health, brain development, intelligence, educational attainment, and productivity.”

“Balochistan Nutrition Program for Mothers & Children (BNPMC) is a good initiative of the Government that is addressing the malnutrition issue in seven districts of the Province, it must be expended to all the districts of Balochistan on emergency basis to address this major issue and a detailed and effective Health Policy is required to address the issue of malnutrition, promotion of breastfeeding and behavior change,” Gull Khan added.

Gull Khan is of the view that school level feeding programs have also been effective in past; such programs may be started again to provide nutritious food supplement to school going children at primary school level particularly in rural areas. “The Health Department, Nutrition cell, food department, education department, BNPMC and NGOs working on nutrition must jointly plan and implement awareness and behavior change campaigns and projects in the province with an at least 05-year plan,” Gul Khan Naseer suggested.

Pakistan is a signatory to The UN Sustainable Development Goals, that also aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030. Zero Hunger is one of the 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Dr.Ali Nasir Bugti said that ending or controlling Malnutrition was a multi-context sectoral approach and liaising is fore mostly acquired but this could not be dealt alone by the Health Department or the Nutrition Program. “To this devastating situation Government must constitute a Nutrition Directorate on immediate basis where all departments i.e. Food, Fisheries, Agriculture, Social welfare, Local government, Information, Education, Livestock, Forestry, PHE, Irrigation etc have their representatives that work in a coordinated manner,” Said Dr. Bugti.

The GCAS convened from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, US, and resulted in range of new climate commitments and announcements by subnational stakeholders.

During the dialogue on rapid transition to a net-zero society, participants shared stories and ideas on the leadership and change required to make zero emissions development a reality, including strengthening and expanding public and private sector partnerships and synergies.

The dialogue aimed to: help to set the scene for the GCAS by bringing the Talanoa spirit into the Summit through constructive and inclusive dialogue with inspiring stories; provide high-level inputs to the GCAS outcomes; and contribute to the development of high-level key messages to be presented at the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue during the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018.

Many NDCs do not incorporate the “best ideas and solutions,” which are currently being implemented at the sub-national level, said Frank Bainimarama.

During the dialogue, COP 23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama stressed that current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) “fall far short” of the Paris Agreement’s goals, noting that many NDCs do not incorporate the “best ideas and solutions,” which are currently being implemented at the subnational level. The event focused on the third of the three questions posed by the Talanoa Dialogue process: How do we get there?

Participants called on political and government leaders at all levels to set national, regional, sectoral and city-level targets, and create the necessary frameworks to establish “predictable economic and a socially-conscious environments.”

Dialogue participants called on business leaders to:

establish and ensure the necessary resources to achieve science-based targets, including creating an environment that encourages innovation;

expand their climate ambition into supply chains; and

motivate their peers to take action.

Additionally, the dialogue called on:

the investment community to commit their companies and clients to use financial resources to expand technologies, incorporate the assessment of climate-related risk and promote financial disclosure;

civil society leaders to call for responsible, committed and accountable governments and companies, and promote behavioral change; and

spiritual leaders to unlock spiritual pathways for addressing climate change by helping people to reconnect to “the wonders of nature and creation, nurture love for the planet and foster compassion and reconciliation.”

The Fijian COP 23 Presidency and the Office of the Governor of the State of California organized the event.

The COP 23 Presidency also hosted a finance-themed Talanoa dialogue on 14 September 2018, which brought together representatives from across the financial system to determine what is required to reach net zero emissions and contribute to the SDGs. The event was co-organized by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Climate Policy Institute.

Talanoa is a traditional Fijian word used across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue. The process aims to support governments in raising their national climate ambition as they prepare for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, where dialogue outcomes will be formally presented to governments to inform the next round of NDCs, along with helping to raise short-term ambition.

An editor on the CBS News national desk was calling and directed LaGanga to drive to downtown Manhattan to shoot what, at that time, was thought to be a small plane crash at the World Trade Center.

Mark LaGanga after he shot his footage at ground zero on September 11, 2001

LaGanga, now a 60 Minutes cameraman, tried to make sense of the nightmare unfolding in front of him as he raced down Manhattan's West Side Highway. Then he turned on his camera.

Seventeen years after the September 11th terrorist attack, the footage LaGanga captured provides a remarkable firsthand account of rescue workers at ground zero moments after the two planes hit. It also gives viewers a rare look at the 29 minutes of dust, confusion, and stillness in between the time the two World Trade Center towers collapsed.

""I saw the twin towers fall""

LaGanga arrived on the scene shortly after 10 am. He stood on his news truck to get a better angle of the smoke billowing out of the north tower, not realizing that the south tower behind it had already fallen.

""There was so much dust and the street signs were hard to see that it never really dawned on me that one tower already came down,"" he tells 60 Minutes Overtime in the video above.

As LaGanga walked from the highway toward the base of the north tower, he interviewed passing firemen, asking the question on everyone's mind: ""What happened?""

On the street near the remaining tower, New York City looked unrecognizable, hazy and monochromatic. A thick layer of dust and soot caked every surface. LaGanga turned his camera upward to film the north tower, smoldering and stark against a bright blue sky.

Minutes later, it too would collapse. LaGanga's camera kept rolling.

""It sounded like a jet flying over,"" he says. ""That's why I panned up.""

As the building fell in on itself, people sprinted down the street, panicked. An ensuing wave of smoke and dust engulfed LaGanga's lens, and the screen turned to black. Several minutes elapsed. Finally, he coughed.

""Boy, that was close,"" a voice said in the dark.

LaGanga tells Overtime that he returned to film the rescue and recovery at ground zero for a week after the attack. Remarkably, he says he's experienced no adverse health effects as a result of his time on the site.

Mark LaGanga today

Since then, LaGanga has continued working as a photojournalist, most recently for 60 Minutes.

""At the end of the day, what we're trying to do is capture real moments,"" he says. ""So you just kind of follow and try not to get in anyone's way. But document real moments of what's going on.""

Nelson Mandela once said, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” This belief resonates with the theme of World Food Day 2018 – Zero Hunger World is possible by 2030. Celebrated on 16 October each year to revisit the status of food and nutrition security, the World Food Day informs the global development discourse, and renews the pledge to end hunger and malnutrition. In recent years, food insecurity has also been viewed as a non-traditional security threat for poor regions. Food-poor people are more likely to be embroiled in conflict, particularly over natural resources.

The task ahead is daunting. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) (2016), around 11 per cent of the global population is suffering from chronic undernourishment. The absolute number of undernourished people is the largest in Asia (FAO, 2017). The prevalence of undernourishment is rising in South Asia, from 9.4 per cent in 2015 to 11.5 per cent in 2016 (FAO 2017). Wasting and stunting are the visible consequences of malnutrition. According to a joint report of UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank (2018), wasting prevalence in 2017 was estimated at almost 8 per cent across the globe. The same report underlines the fact that approximately two-thirds of all wasted children under five live in Asia.

The figures are more depressing in mountain regions such as the Hindukush Himalayas (HKH) where people face multiple challenges including poverty, inaccessibility, fragility, limited market access and climatic induced risks. In the HKH region, nearly 31 per cent of the population suffers from food insecurity, 50 per cent are malnourished, and women and children suffer the most.

There are many factors that influence food security; poverty and climate change are the two biggest challenges. Climate plays an important role in agriculture and changing temperatures,erratic rainfall and increasing frequency of extreme events have impacted agricultural activities everywhere, creating unfavourable conditions for food production. Further, the change from multi to mono cropping systems limits the diversity of agricultural products. Likewise, an increasing inclination towards cash crops and changing food habits restrict the dietary intake of people and may result in malnutrition, undernutrition and even micro-nutrient deficiencies. Food wastage is also an emerging challenge that undermines the efforts to end hunger and malnutrition. According to the FAO, the global volume of food wastage is estimated at 1.6 billion tonnes of primary product equivalents. Ending food waste is therefore crucial to achieving zero hunger by 2030.

In a developing country like Nepal, social structures also determine food availability, especially for women. Women tend to first feed their children and other members of the family before eating themselves. In doing so, their nutritional requirements are often unmet as they consume whatever is left after everyone else has eaten. Such scenarios are common in villages and rural settings not only in Nepal but also in India. Low agricultural investments and poor health, sanitation and childcare practices are other hindrances in achieving zero hunger.

In the light of these facts, it may seem impossible to see a world free of hunger by 2030. Yet, countries like China and Myanmar have reduced under nutrition substantially.

It is also important to look at the future of food production to achieve the zero hunger goal. New technologies and devices like mobile phones can be used for knowledge transfer to rural farmers on the food production cycle and market linkages. Agriculture is a huge business and it is important to create opportunities and careers for the younger generation to take up and practice agriculture in order to safeguard long-term food security.

Fighting hunger is a global mission and zero hunger is also one of the main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires strong determination and commitment from individual nations. Formulating policies that support better agricultural investments, providing agriculture subsidies and incentives, promoting child and women health care, prioritising nutrition programmes, and boosting the production and consumption of climate resilient native nutritional crops are some of the elementary practices that will be crucial in defeating hunger and creating a zero hunger world by 2030.","Fighting hunger is a global mission and zero hunger is also one of the main Sustainable Development Goals, achieving which requires strong determination and commitment from individual nationsNelson Mandela once said, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” This belief resonates with the theme of World Food Day 2018 – Zero Hunger World is possible by 2030.

SDG2 includes five targets and three sub-targets, as well as 13 indicators.

2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.

ADVERTISEMENT

2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.

2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.

2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.

2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.

2.A Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries.

2.B Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.

2.C Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

Progress to date

The UN's most recent SDG progress report for SDG2 starts on a bleak note. ""After a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again,"" it states. ""Conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing the reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 more difficult.""

The increase in the global undernourishment rate is marginal - climbing from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11 per cent in 2016 - but it amounts to 38 million more people going hungry and the potential long term causes of the reversal have policymakers globally extremely worried. Is this a blip caused by food price spikes and protracted conflicts in parts of the Middle East and Africa or is this one of the clearest signs yet that long-projected climate impacts are starting to bite?

Either way, the implications are severe. Malnutrition-induced stunting - where children are too short for their age - is declining in almost every region, but it still impacts 22 per cent of children under five globally. Meanwhile, further evidence of a flawed global food system is provided by the fact that last year 51 million children under five were suffering from wasting, while 38 million were affected by obesity.

Assessing progress on agricultural sustainability remains difficult given the huge number of metrics involved and the massive variations from region to region, but one figure stands out that suggests governments are yet to fully recognise the scale of the challenge: government expenditure in the agricultural sector as a share of GDP fell from 0.38 per cent in 2001 to 0.23 per cent in 2016.

There are few, if any, large scale government-backed sustainable agriculture programmes in operation and R&D funding across the sector is also notoriously underpowered.

However, there is also a potentially encouraging explanation for the fall in government expenditure, as the UN notes progress has been made in reducing subsidies that distort world agricultural markets, with export subsidies having halved inside five years from $491m in 2010 to less than $200m in 2015.

Business implications

SDG2 mirrors SDG1 in its remarkable breadth. Everybody needs to eat; every business has a stake in the food supply chain, whether directly as producers or consumers of food, or indirectly through the need for healthy employees and stable, food-secure societies; every country needs a sustainable agricultural sector, arguably above all else.

As such, all businesses can support SDG2 by purchasing food with strong sustainability credentials, promoting good nutrition amongst staff and stakeholders, and lobbying for a greater policy focus on sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation.

However, it is for businesses with a direct role in the food supply chain where SDG2 will inevitably have the biggest impact. The inter-locking goals of ending hunger and poor nutrition while embracing sustainable agriculture that improves ""capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters"" requires sustained increased in yields and higher productivity. But such improvements need to be delivered without the unsustainable intensification that has accelerated soil and biodiversity loss in many parts of the world.

The goal's targets imply systems change across the agri-food industry centred on drastically improved supply chain transparency, ever closer co-operation between farmers - including developing economy smallholders - and end customers, increased R&D spend, a better understanding of ecosystem services, more effective policy interventions and subsidy reforms, and an end to gaming the food commodity market in a way that creates food price volatility.

Business risks

As the most recent UN progress report makes clear SDG2 will be very difficult to achieve. The world is engaged in a race against time to accelerate the adoption of sustainable agricultural methods and enhance food security at a faster rate than climate impacts undermine yields. A failure to win this race would see businesses the world over have to wrestle with rising food prices and the social and economic insecurity that would inevitably result.

More specifically, businesses operating in the food and agriculture space face a web of risks relating to both the supply chain disruption that will likely come if sustainable agricultural practices are not embraced and the disruption that will inevitably accompany attempts to push the sector towards new approaches.

Risks include increased climate impacts leading to higher food prices and availability risks, as well as food price spikes contributing to economic, social, and political instability.

At the same time changes to agricultural subsidies could spark a major shake out of the sector that could lead to further consolidation, while tighter regulations to protect ecosystems and measures to secure fairer deals for farmers at the end of the supply chain could leading to higher short term costs for some operators.

Finally, emerging biotechnologies and changing consumer appetites, such as the trend for vegetarianism, could destroy value and lead to stranded assets for firms that fail to adapt.

Business opportunities

The global effort to deliver on SDG2 should improve the long term risk profiles for all businesses and also create a raft of specific business opportunities arising from the transition to sustainable agricultural techniques.

Reduced levels of malnutrition and food price volatility is likely to result in stronger economic growth in emerging markets and reduced risks of economic, social, and political instability globally. Meanwhile, improved climate resilience and genetic diversity of seeds and livestock should help minimise wider climate and security risks.

Increased R&D across the agricultural sector promises to also unlock a new era of innovation for a highly conservative and inefficient industry, bringing massive resource and cost savings across the piece. At the same time the targeted doubling of yields promises improved financial returns throughout the supply chain.

Similarly, improved nutrition has the potential to bolster economic growth and enhance productivity through improved health across the workforce.

And the nascent trends towards vegetarianism and more sustainable agriculture promises to cut methane emissions, curb deforestation, enhance ecosystem services, and free up more land for biodiversity, while also opening up major new technology-led markets.

Ultimately, businesses that take a holistic approach to SDG2 demonstrating progress in supporting smallholders, protecting habitats, and promoting sustainable practices, while tackling hunger and delivering healthy products should reap dividends amongst an increasingly values-led employee and customer base.","Progress to dateThe UN's most recent SDG progress report for SDG2 starts on a bleak note.

This article is part of a series of opinion pieces to mark World Food Day October 16

José Graziano da Silva is Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

ROME, Oct 15 2018 (IPS) - Just three years ago, in September 2015, all United Nations Member States approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition (Sustainable Development Goal number 2) was defined by world leaders as a cardinal objective of the Agenda, a sine qua non condition for a safer, fairer and more peaceful world.

Paradoxically, global hunger has only grown since then. According to the latest estimates, the number of undernourished people in the world increased in 2017, for the third consecutive year. Last year, 821 million people suffered from hunger (11 percent of the world population – one in nine people on the planet), most of them family and subsistence farmers living in poor rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.

However, the growing rate of undernourished people is not the only big challenge we are facing. Other forms of malnutrition have also increased. In 2017, at least 1.5 billion people suffered from micronutrient deficiencies that undermine their health and lives, At the same time, the proportion of adult obesity continues to rise , from 11.7 percent in 2012 to 13.3 percent in 2016 (or 672.3 million people).

Hunger is mainly circumscribed to specific areas, namely those ravaged by conflicts, droughts and extreme poverty; yet obesity is everywhere, and it is increasing all around the world. As a matter of fact, we are witnessing the globalization of obesity. For example: obesity rates are climbing faster in Africa than any other region – eight of the 20 countries in the world with the fastest rising rates of adult obesity are in Africa. Furthermore, childhood overweight affected 38 million children under five years of age in 2017. About 46 percent of these children live in Asia, while 25 percent live in Africa.

If we do not call for urgent actions to halt the increasing obesity rates, we soon may have more obese than undernourished people in the world. The growing rate of obesity is happening at a huge socio-economic cost. Obesity is a risk factor for many non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Estimates indicate that the global economic impact of obesity is about USD 2 trillion per year (2.8 percent of the global GDP). This is equivalent to the impacts of smoking or armed conflicts.

This year, World Food Day (celebrated every 16th of October) aims to remind the international community of its fundamental political commitment to humanity – the eradication of all forms of malnutrition – and raise awareness that achieving a Zero Hunger world by 2030 (so in 12 years-time) is still possible. The experience of Brazil is a good example to have in mind.

According to FAO estimates, hunger in Brazil was reduced from 10.6 percent of the total population (about 19 million people) at the beginning of the 2000s to less than 2.5 percent in the 2008-2010 triennium, which is the minimum value in which FAO can make meaningful statistical inference. This reduction in the number of undernourished people was mainly possible due to the firm commitment of former President Lula and the implementation of public policies and social protection programmes addressing extreme poverty and the impacts of prolonged droughts in the northeastern part of the country.

In fact, governments have the most fundamental role in achieving Zero Hunger by ensuring that vulnerable people have sufficient income to buy the food they need, or the means to produce it for themselves – even in times of conflict.

However, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment. It aims to provide people with the necessary nutrients for a healthy life. Zero Hunger encompasses the eradication of all forms of malnutrition. So it is not just about feeding people but nourishing people as well.

Current global food systems have increased the availability and accessibility of processed food that is very caloric and energy-dense, high in fat, sugar and salt. Food systems must be transformed in a way so that all people can consume healthy and nutritious food. We need to address obesity as a public issue, not as an individual problem. This requires the adoption of a multisectoral approach involving not only governments, but also international organizations, national institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector and citizens in general.

It must be a collective effort towards healthy diets that include, for instance, the creation of norms such as labelling and the banning of some harmful ingredients, the introduction of nutrition in the school curriculum, the adoption of methods to avoid food loss and waste, and the establishment of trade agreements that do not hamper access to locally grown, fresh and nutritious food from family farming.

“Our actions are our future” is the message of World Food Day 2018. It is time to renew our commitment and, even more important, the political support towards a sustainable world free from hunger and all forms of malnutrition.","Paradoxically, global hunger has only grown since then.
However, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment.
Zero Hunger encompasses the eradication of all forms of malnutrition.

This article forms part of the IPS coverage for World Food Day, celebrated on October 16.

SANTIAGO, Oct 14 2018 (IPS) - For the third consecutive year, South America slid backwards in the global struggle to achieve zero hunger by 2030, with 39 million people living with hunger and five million children suffering from malnutrition.

“It’s very distressing because we’re not making progress. We’re not doing well, we’re going in reverse. You can accept this in a year of great drought or a crisis somewhere, but when it’s happened three years in a row, that’s a trend,” reflected Julio Berdegué, FAO’s highest authority in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The regional representative of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations said it is cause for concern that it is not Central America, the poorest subregion, that is failing in its efforts, but the South American countries that have stagnated.

“More than five million children in Latin America are permanently malnourished. In a continent of abundant food, a continent of upper-middle- and high-income countries, five million children … It’s unacceptable,” he said in an interview with IPS at the agency’s regional headquarters in Santiago.

“They are children who already have scars in their lives. Children whose lives have already been marked, even though countries, governments, civil society, NGOs, churches, and communities are working against this. The development potential of a child whose first months and years of life are marked by malnutrition is already radically limited for his entire life,” he said.

What can the region do to move forward again? In line with this year’s theme of World Food Day, celebrated Oct. 16, “Our actions are our future. A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible”, Berdegué underlined the responsibility of governments and society as a whole.

Governments, he said, must “call us all together, facilitate, support, promote job creation and income generation, especially for people from the weakest socioeconomic strata.”

In addition, he stressed that policies for social protection, peace and the absence of conflict and addressing climate change are also required.

New foods to improve nutrition

In the small town of Los Muermos, near Puerto Montt, 1,100 kilometers south of Santiago, nine women and two male algae collectors are working to create new foods, with the aim of helping to curb both under- and over-nutrition, in Chile and in neighboring countries. Their star product is jam made with cochayuyo (Durvillaea antarctica), a large bull kelp species that is the dominant seaweed in southern Chile.

“I grew up on the water. I’ve been working along the sea for more than 30 years, as a shore gatherer,” said Ximena Cárcamo, 48, president of the Flor del Mar fishing cooperative.

The seaweed gatherer told IPS from Los Muermos about the great potential of cochayuyo and other algae “that boost health and nutrition because they have many benefits for people,” in a region with high levels of poverty and social vulnerability, which translate into under-nutrition.

“We are adding value to products that we have in our locality. We want people to consume them and that’s why we made jam because children don’t eat seaweed and in Chile we have so many things that people don’t consume and that could help improve their diet,” she explained.

In the first stage, the women, with the support of the Aquaculture and Fishing Centre for Applied Research, identified which seaweed have a high nutritional value, are rich in minerals, proteins, fiber and vitamins, and have low levels of sugar.

The seaweed gatherers created a recipe book, “cooking with seaweed from the sea garden”, including sweet and salty recipes such as cochayuyo ice cream, rice pudding and luche and reineta ceviche with sea chicory.

Now the project aims to create high value-added food such as energy bars.

“We want to reach schools, where seaweed is not consumed. That’s why we want to mix them with dried fruit from our sector,” said Cárcamo, insisting that a healthy and varied diet introduced since childhood is the way to combat malnutrition, as well as the “appalling” levels of overweight and obesity that affects Chile, as well as the rest of Latin America.

The paradox of obesity

“Obesity is killing us…it kills more people than organised crime,” Berdegué warned, pointing out that in terms of nutrition the region is plagued by under-nutrition on the one hand and over-nutrition on the other.

“Nearly 60 percent of the region’s population is overweight. There are 250 million candidates for diabetes, colon cancer or stroke,” he said.

He explained that “there are 105 million obese people, who are key candidates for these diseases. More than seven million children are obese with problems of self-esteem and problems of emotional and physical development. They are children who are candidates to die young,” he said.

According to Berdegué, this problem “is growing wildly…there are four million more obese people in the region each year.”

The latest statistic for 2016 reported 105 million obese people in Latin America and the Caribbean, up from 88 million only four years earlier.

In view of this situation, the FAO regional representative stressed the need for a profound transformation of the food system.

“How do we produce, what do we produce, what do we import, how is it distributed, what is access like in your neighborhood? What do you do if you live in a neighborhood where the only store, that is 500 meters away, only sells ultra-processed food and does not sell vegetables or fruits?” he asked.

Berdegué harshly criticised “advertising, which tells us every day that good eating is to go sit in a fast food restaurant and eat 2,000 calories of junk as if that were entirely normal.”

Change of policies as well as habits

“You have to change habits, yes, but you have to change policies as well. There are countries, such as the small Caribbean island nations, that depend fundamentally on imported food. And the vast majority of these foods are ultra-processed, many of which are food only in name because they’re actually just chemicals, fats and junk,” he said.

He insisted that “we lack production of fruits, vegetables and dairy products in many countries or trade policies that encourage imports of these foods and not so much junk food.”

And to move toward the goal of zero hunger in just 12 years, Berdegué also called for generating jobs and improving incomes, because that “is the best policy against hunger.”

The second of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which make up the 2030 Development Agenda, is achieving zero hunger through eight specific targets.

Poverty making a comeback

“In Latin America we don’t lack food. People just can’t afford to buy it,” Berdegué said.

He also called for countries to strengthen policies to protect people living in poverty and extreme poverty.

According to the latest figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), poverty in the region grew between 2014 and 2017, when it affected 186 million people, 30.7 percent of the population. Extreme poverty affects 10 percent of the total: 61 million people.

Moreover, in this region where 82 percent of the population is urban, 48.6 percent of the rural population is poor, compared to 26.8 percent of the urban population, and this inequality drives the rural exodus to the cities.

“FAO urges countries to rethink social protection policies, particularly for children. We cannot allow ourselves to slow down in eradicating malnutrition and hunger among children,” Berdegué said.

He also advocated for the need for peace and the cessation of conflicts because “we have all the evidence in the world that when you lose peace, hunger soars. It is automatic. The great hunger hotspots and problems in the world today are in places where we are faced with conflict situations.”

“We have countries in the region where there is upheaval and governments have to know that this social and political turmoil causes hunger,” he concluded.","SANTIAGO, Oct 14 2018 (IPS) - For the third consecutive year, South America slid backwards in the global struggle to achieve zero hunger by 2030, with 39 million people living with hunger and five million children suffering from malnutrition.

José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has released a video message on the occasion of the World Food Day, October 16.

By Robin Gomes

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is urging nations, continents, sectors and professions to join forces and take action to eliminate hunger, saying a Zero Hunger World by 2030 is still possible. FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva made the call in a video message on the occasion of World Food Day that was marked worldwide on Tuesday.

FAO marks World Food Day each year on 16 October to highlight the need to step up efforts to end hunger and malnutrition in the world.

The theme of this year’s observance is ""Our actions are our future. A #ZeroHunger world by 2030 is possible"". Various events are being held in over 130 countries, including at the FAO headquarters in Rome, to mark World Food Day.

Listen to our report

Three years ago, in September 2015, all UN Member States approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 2 aims at the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This SDG was defined by world leaders as an indispensable condition for a safer, fairer and more peaceful world.

In his message, Graziano pointed out that this year’s World Food Day was taking place at a critical moment in the fight against hunger and malnutrition.

Growing number of hungry

The FAO Director-General noted that for 3 consecutive years, the number of hungry people worldwide has been growing and the trend showed the world was returning to levels of 10 years ago. According to the latest “State of Food Security in the World” report, nearly 820 million people were undernourished in 2017.



Graziano noted that conflicts, extreme weather events linked to climate change and economic slowdown were reversing the progress made in the fight against hunger.

He also noted that overweight and obesity levels were growing rapidly. The FAO chief said it was time the world community redoubled its efforts to achieve the global goal of Zero Hunger.

Joining forces against hunger, malnutrition

The FAO Director-General said this year’s World Day calls on the international community to work more closely together, and make use of the evidence and tools available. Three years ago, he noted, “all UN Member Countries pledged to end poverty and hunger, when they committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.”

“Zero Hunger,” Graziano said, “is still achievable if we join forces across nations, continents, sectors and professions, in the remaining years for 2030.” “ Taking action is not an option, Graziano stressed, adding, “ It is a necessary step to a truly sustainable future for all.”

Noting that our present actions will determine our future, Graziano said that a Zero Hunger World by 2030 is still possible.","(ANSA)José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has released a video message on the occasion of the World Food Day, October 16.

People across the globe were having a collective moment of raising awareness about the hunger crisis on Tuesday, which marked World Food Day. Hunger, inextricably linked to poverty, disproportionally affects African-Americans, motivating many Black folks to find practical ways to fight to end the crisis.

Oprah Winfrey, who has long used her influence and celebrity status to call attention to human rights issues such as hunger, volunteered at the Freestore Foodbank in Cincinnati last month. The mogul partnered with retail company Kroger to attack hunger, WKRC, a CBS and CW affiliate, reported.

“Every step to zero hunger in this country, this city, this world is a step in the right direction,” Winfrey said at the time, spotlighting an issue that the United Nations said it hoped to completely eradicate by 2030.

The crisis hits home for many people nationwide, but for African-Americans, it’s been even worse. Black people are more than twice as likely to face hunger, according to Feeding America. That was widely connected to high poverty rates among Blacks — more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households in 2017.

With such a high poverty rate, it is no wonder why African Americans are trying to fight back. Volunteers, farmers, activists and celebrities alike are all using their power to make a difference to combat hunger.

For instance, Chance the Rapper has played a role in trying to combat hunger in his native Chicago. The lyricist had teamed up with Lyft to donate $1 million to the city’s schools, and his gift can go a long way in helping provide breakfast and lunch for hungry students.

T.I. also recently decided to pay for a year’s worth of school lunches for a teenager in Florida. A high school had reportedly denied food to the teen, Danielle Aiken because she was 15 cents short in August.

Perhaps other rappers will also donate money for institutions in their home cities and help students afford school meals. The National School Lunch Program allows for 100,000 schools to serve school lunches to 30 million students each day. The program provides 20 million free lunches, 2 million reduced-price lunches in which students pay $0.40 each and 8 million full price lunches, according to the School Nutrition Association.

If more people support families struggling to provide meals for their school-age children and global hunger efforts, then the UN’s goal of ending hunger in just 12 years could come true.

According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. is thrown away. At the same time, more than 10 percent of Americans struggle with hunger, reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

As part of the Kroger/Dillons-wide initiative, employees are taking a closer look at every aspect of the business and brainstorming ways to cut back on waste. Environmental accountability is gaining momentum in the corporate sector, with several major corporations like Walmart, Texas Instruments and Estee Lauder setting similar goals.

In Dillons stores, everything -- from unsold food items in the deli to shipping pallets -- can be directed away from landfills, says Sheila Lowrie, corporate affairs manager of Dillons.

“Each department has a way they can contribute to this movement,” Lowrie said.

In Hutchinson, the Dillons Marketplace store on 30th Avenue is diverting 79.19 percent of waste. The goal is to divert 90 percent company-wide by 2025.

Recycling takes no extra effort from employees -- the time spent collecting and throwing away trash is instead used for recycling. And employees are also using the recycling tips learned on the job at home.

“We weren’t doing the best of jobs before and we’ve come so far,"" said Dillons Marketplace Store Manager Mike Matney. ""When you go from throwing 20 to 30 trash cans out every day to throwing away none, you know you’re making a difference in the environment and the community,”

Other Dillons stores in Hutchinson are participating, but the Marketplace store is serving as a flagship that can develop solutions for others.

“We selected this store because it’s so large and there are so many departments,"" Lowrie said. ""If we can achieve it here, we can achieve it in other stores.”

Redirect

Fruit and vegetables with minor blemishes that would normally be thrown away are bagged and sold for a discount or donated to the Reno County Food Bank. Meat that hasn’t sold, but is still good to eat, is frozen and also donated.

“So far this year in our division, we were able to provide 100,000 meals since this time last year because of our focus on rescued food for donations,” Lowrie said.

Penny Taapken, director of the Reno County Food Bank, explained that donations straight from the store improve what she can offer area families.

“Clients can go out with more fresh produce, dairy, whatever they send us. That’s a supplement to what they’re able to receive,” Taapken said. “They all appreciate it; sometimes they come in amazed at what’s available.”

What can’t be donated can be diverted. The food bank can’t accept pre-made foods like sandwiches or cakes past their prime, but those can still be good for animals.

Meat trimmings from the deli department are used to make dog treats. Produce or bakery items are used to make feed for cattle.

“They take apart the sandwiches we have here so the meat goes in the meat rendering bin and the bread and cheese go in the food diversion bin. They’re doing a great job of making sure everything gets to the right place,” said Ben Hughes, expense manager for Dillons. “The cows love it when there are doughnuts. They love the sweet stuff.”

The resulting feed is kept in-state by going to Struther's Ranch in North Milton.

“Not only are we helping the environment, we’re also helping local companies,” Hughes said.

Improvements can still be made, such as in the floral department. Flowers and trimmings could be composted, but it isn’t cost effective.

“It’s a matter of having someone who will do it,"" Hughes explained. ""Composting is very expensive. There are divisions that compost, but it takes a lot of space. If you’ve been out to the dump, you’ll see rows and rows of composting that have to be constantly turned.”

Recycle

The first line of defense for non-food items is source reduction, Lowrie said. This includes smart ordering practices and returning shipping pallets for future use.

What can’t be reduced can often be recycled. Large pallets are sent back on the salvage truck to reuse, but reusing quarter pallets isn’t as easy. Instead, the store began selling them to crafters interested in making home decorations and other craft projects.

While employees make a number of changes behind the scenes, customers can also make small changes to lessen their impact on the environment.

“Every day, we use 6 billion bags throughout the whole Kroger company. About 10 percent of those bags are recycled every year,” Lowrie said. “So many of our customers are using reusable bags today, so we’d like to encourage this.”","Dillons stores are celebrating a year of implementing the Zero Huger/Zero Waste initiative, which seeks to improve communities by solving both hunger and food waste.

2 November 2018, Changsha CHINA - Government representatives attending the Ministerial Forum on South-South Cooperation in Agriculture have today committed to greater South-South cooperation on agriculture and rural development to increase momentum towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of ending poverty and hunger.

The Changsha Declaration, formalized at the end of today's forum, sets out plans to include South-South cooperation principles into national policies and programmes, and was agreed to by 26 countries and 11 international organizations.

""As the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015 by world leaders calls for the eradication of extreme poverty, hunger and all forms of malnutrition, more and more we need to mobilize private sector financing in support of the 2030 Agenda, as without the private sector we will never achieve the desired goals by 2030,"" the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva said during his closing remarks.

The result of this Ministerial Forum will provide new momentum for international development cooperation, and will be an important contribution to the second UN Conference on South-South Cooperation (BAPA+40) to be held in Argentina next year.

China's leading example

The forum in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was organized by FAO and China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. In 2006, China was the first country to establish a strategic alliance with FAO on South-South cooperation, and today more than one thousand Chinese experts and technicians have supported 37 countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean on agriculture issues.

On the sidelines of the forum, FAO signed a two-year agreement with China and Madagascar that will see China share its technical expertise to boost Madagascar's agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors, with support from FAO. One of the aims of the project is to make Madagascar self-sufficient in rice production by 2025.

Working together

Demand by countries for South-South cooperation programs has increased in the past decade, and such programs have proven to be an effective instrument for sharing knowledge and facilitating mutual learning.

To respond to the growing demand, FAO together with sister Rome-based UN agencies the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have produced the Joint Roadmap on Sooth-South Cooperation as a common strategy for implementing triangular projects in developing countries.

Hunger and malnutrition in Asia

The forum comes as four UN agencies (FAO, UNICEF, WFP, WHO) released a new regional report on food security and malnutrition in Asia and the Pacific region. The report highlights that nearly half a billion people (486 million) are undernourished in the region, with little improvement in the last two years. One child in every four (79 million) suffers from stunting and 34 million children are wasting, including 12 million who suffer from severe acute malnutrition. At the same time, obesity in the region is increasing.

The four agencies warn of a colossal human loss to Asia and the Pacific and its economies if countries in the region do not recommit themselves to ending all forms of malnutrition and achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.

Centre of Excellence

The Director-General also announced plans to establish an International Centre of Excellence for Agriculture Innovation and Rural Development in Beijing. The Centre will provide training and capacity development for agricultural innovation and rural revitalization, and promote greater investment in rural areas in order to fast-track the achievement of Zero Hunger.

Graziano da Silva also signed a Memorandum of Understanding between FAO and the China Agriculture Science and Education Foundation. The collaboration will focus on fostering sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural development in China, reducing rural poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, and facilitating China's regional and international agricultural cooperation.

WFP’s Executive Director, David Beasley, and Alibaba Partner and Chairman of the Alibaba Foundation, Sun Lijun, signed the agreement at Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China.

What exactly will come out of this partnership?

Under the framework, Alibaba will provide its leading technology and resources to support the digital transformation of WFP’s operations. In particular, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba, will collaborate with WFP to develop a digital World Hunger Map to monitor the status of global hunger and help enhance the efficiency of operations to support efforts towards the goal of ending world hunger by 2030.

Alleviating global poverty and fighting hunger is the shared vision of Alibaba and WFP, said Sun. We look forward to joining the global campaign of fighting hunger using our innovative technologies in data intelligence and cloud computing, as well as sharing our experience in China and worldwide.

Beasley lauded the strategic partnership as a milestone in the relationship between WFP and China’s private sector.

We now have a great ally in the fight against hunger, he said. The support and expertise of the Alibaba Group including their cloud computing, advanced data analytic capabilities, and online platforms will help WFP become even more efficient and effective in its work to reverse the trend of rising hunger around the world.

The visual World Hunger Map is intended to leverage data insights to help WFP improve assessment and monitoring to increase efficiency and shorten emergency response times. To coordinate their joint efforts, the parties will also create a Digital Transformation Working Group to determine priorities, assess new opportunities, and review progress on projects.

Alibaba established the Alibaba Poverty Relief Program in December 2017, aiming to invest RMB10 billion in five years to alleviate poverty with focuses on education, rural commerce advancement, empowering women, healthcare and environmental sustainability. In August, 2017, Alibaba worked with WFP on a poverty alleviation project by connecting small farmers in Anhui, a province in Eastern China, directly with the market to obtain better prices for agricultural produce.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường made the statement at the International Support Group (ISG) Plenary Meeting 2018 held on Thursday in Hà Nội.

At the meeting, he called for co-operation and support from international partners, related ministries and agencies, domestic and foreign businesses, and voluteers to jointly implement the National Action Plan on Zero Hunger in Việt Nam by 2025.

“Việt Nam aims to provide enough food and nutrition to enhance Vietnamese people’s mental and physical health, and, at the same time, to implement the Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) to which the Government has committed with the UN,” the minister said.

The Zero Hunger initiative was launched by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in 2012.

Việt Nam was one of the countries with remarkable achievements in reducing the number of hungry and poor people.

However, some gaps remain. The child malnutrition rate remains high, based on the WHO classification. Particularly, the stunting–form malnutrition rate is especially high in provinces in the Central Highlands, north central and northern mountainous region.

Through the National Action Plan (NAP), Việt Nam aims to narrow the existing gaps and improve the country’s food security and nutrition.

The five key targets of the NAP by 2025 are that households will have enough food with sufficient nutrition all year round; malnutrition in children under two will be reduced; sustainable food systems will be developed; productivity and income of most small-scale production households will increase; and food will not be lost or wasted.

As agriculture and nutrition often involve different sectors and require diverse expertise, a complex action plan targeting different levels ranging from policymakers to community-level stakeholders will be implemented by different ministries.

“As a specialised agency of the United Nations with a clear mandate to address hunger and poverty, FAO has been taking the lead in undertaking the global Sustainable Food and Agriculture programme to contribute to the Zero Hunger goal,” said Albert T Lieberg, a representative of FAO Việt Nam.

“Achieving food security requires an integrated and holistic approach and we believe that, with intersectional collaboration and partnerships, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to reach a shared conviction of the National Action Plan so hunger can be eliminated in our lifetimes,” he said. — VNS","HÀ NỘI — The Vietnamese Government affirmed that agricultural development was the best solution to the ""Zero Hunger"" and ""poverty reduction"" challenges, contributing to the goal of sustainable hunger eradication, food security and improved nutrition.

37,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/alliance-for-zero-extinction-assessment-finds-43-percent-of-critical-sites-unprotected/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Alliance for Zero Extinction Assessment Finds 43 Percent of Critical Sites Unprotected,"16 November 2018: The international Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) released an assessment that finds concerted action is necessary to protect sites that are home to highly threatened species. AZE released the assessment in advance of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

AZE is a global partnership that works to identify, map and safeguard sites that are home to highly threatened species. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) supported the assessment as part of the ‘Alliance for Zero Extinction: Conserving Earth’s Most Irreplaceable Sites for Endangered Biodiversity’ project, which is led by BirdLife International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and American Bird Conservancy (ABC). The protection of AZE sites is a recognized indicator for the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets 11 and 12.

The assessment maps the ranges of 1,483 highly threatened species known to only occur in a single site. To qualify for AZE status, a site must be the last known location of a critically endangered or endangered species, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species extinction threat categories. The assessment classifies 853 sites as AZE sites and finds that 43 percent of AZE sites are currently unprotected. Among the 1,483 global AZE trigger species, 41 percent are amphibians, 15 percent are mammals, 13 percent are birds, ten percent are freshwater crustaceans, nine percent are cacti, four percent are cycads and eight percent are classified as other taxa.

Recognition of AZE sites as key biodiversity areas can improve lives through preserving local biodiversity.

AZE Chairman Mike Parr, who also serves as ABC President, emphasized that it has “been proven that well-managed protected areas prevent extinctions.” He said over 20 governments are taking action to protect their AZE sites, but stressed that urgent action is needed from all 109 countries and territories with AZE sites to protect these unique places and species.

The assessment provides evidence that effective protection can improve species’ status. As an illustration, Colombia established the Ranita Amphibian Reserve to protect two species of poison dart frogs (Andinobates dorisswansonae and Andinobates tolimense), an action that has improved the species’ status to the extent that neither frog qualifies as an AZE trigger species any longer. In the US, the ABC, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and others successfully translocated the Millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris) to a second Hawaiian island, which means that the species now occurs in two sites and is no longer considered an AZE trigger species. Brazil, one of the countries with the most AZE sites, became the first country to enact legislation to ensure that AZE sites are taken into account in national development and conservation planning.

In a press release, UNEP biodiversity expert Ersin Esen underscored the importance of conserving AZE sites beyond conservation benefits and preventing extinction of endangered species. Esen explained that the recognition and protection of AZE sites as key biodiversity areas “have the potential not just to save species but to improve lives” through preserving local biodiversity, protecting water sources, mitigating climate change effects and providing cultural and other ecosystem services.

As part of the wider project, AZE is working with the Governments of Brazil, Chile and Madagascar to improve management of AZE sites to halt global extinctions and safeguard key habitats for endangered species. The AZE project also works with key financial institutions to integrate conservation of threatened species into their environmental safeguard policies.

Former ministers Damian Green, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry are among the signatories of the letter to the prime minister, which said that a stronger long-term goal would cut energy bills and improve air quality.

The UK is committed to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. But the government recently asked its climate advisers to consider whether a deeper cut is needed in the light of a landmark UN report on the risks posed by global warming.

Simon Clarke, the Brexiter Tory MP who organised the letter, said: “By setting a net-zero target before 2050 we can ensure the UK is at the forefront of the zero-carbon technological revolution whilst cementing our status as a global climate leader.”

More than 160 MPs have signed the plea to May, including from Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party. Organisers hope to get 100 Tory MPs signed up by the time the government’s advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, reports back next spring.

Meeting a goal of net-zero emissions before 2050 would require far-reaching changes beyond those already under way in energy, buildings and transport.

But the letter’s signatories argue it would put the UK “at the forefront of the race for investment in clean industries”, and build on a history of “British ingenuity” in science and engineering.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used his conference speech in September to commit the party to a target of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. The letter calls for the goal to be met before 2050 but there is no agreed date – WWF said this week that 2045 was possible.

The intervention comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Climate Change Act receiving royal assent on Monday, the same day the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is due to publish a major report on how global warming will affect the UK.","Fifty Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to adopt an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions to net zero before 2050, to show international leadership on climate change and protect British jobs.

39,https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/thai-blogger-slammed-encouraging-zero-baht-travel/,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Coconuts,Thai blogger slammed for encouraging ‘zero baht’ travel,"It’s been a few years since the “begpacking” trend first emerged among Westerners, so maybe it’s not all that surprising that a version of it is taking root among folks here at home — albeit in a slightly more upscale fashion.

Meet Bangkok travel blogger Theerat Wattanakijrungroj, who is being roundly criticized for promoting the concept of “zero-baht” travel, which essentially means asking businesses for food and hotel stays in exchange for his “talent.”

Theerat, who identifies himself as a freelance graphic designer in his social media profile, got people talking this past week while promoting his #NoPlanNoMoneyTrip lifestyle, after boasting about how he stayed at a comfortable hotel in northern Lampang province for free on his Facebook page “Unless You Try.”

“Who says you can’t stay in a comfortable room when you don’t have money?” he wrote on Nov. 15.

“I proved that the fact I don’t have a single baht, I could sleep in on a comfortable bed, in an air-conditioned room that costs THB1,600 (US$50) a night.”

He recalled his conversation with the hotel’s owner: “Hi folks, we traveled from Bangkok and have zero baht. We’re looking for a place to sleep tonight. Is there any area for us to catch some sleep without being bitten by mosquitoes? I’ll do some labor work in exchange for the accommodation.”

He ended the post emphasizing it’s all about being “daring,” but the post received backlash from several netizens who view his act as simply “begging.”

“You call it ‘daring’, others call it ‘burden” one comment said.

From a quick look at the page, Unless You Try was started in June 2016, and Theerat has shared photos and fun stories of him while visiting several countries.

On the page, Theerat mentioned that he would sometimes draw or teach swing dancing in exchange for money of accommodation.

He responded to the drama in a post last week, saying some people simply misunderstand his concept: “I’m not trying to prove that I can beg for food and comfortable life — that’s why I always carry paper and watercolors to exchange for food and accommodation. I’ve learned guitar just enough to perform in exchange for support of my travel. I always ask what I can do in exchange for what they give me.

“I’m simply trying to prove money is not the biggest limitation for your travel if you have enough talent and boldness.”

Well. I guess we all have different opinions.

After all, he got a little more than the necessities.

“I walked out of my house with no money, but I got to sip some wine. Haha,” he wrote on Nov. 19.

https://www.facebook.com/unlessyoutry/photos/a.812902672195708/1223676764451628/?type=3&theater

The post gained mostly negative responses: “It’s great that this sort of people is the minority of our country. Otherwise, our economy would go down.”

“Parasite,” another said.

There’s more.

“When you don’t eat vegetables and have no money, but fate led you to stay in a vegetarian hotel. #UnlessYouTry.”

Netizens responded: “Some day when you start a hotel or any business, I hope you have people begging for free food.”

“#BeggingTour #ShamelessTour #ParasiteTour I’m adding hashtags for ya,” another wrote.

However, Theerat still has his suppporters, who say they admire him for staying true to himself and enjoy reading about his unexpected journeys.

“It’s a good concept. Although it annoys some people, but I understand and I will support you,” user “Kim Jong Un” wrote. (Ed: We’re like 99.9% it’s not the one you’re thinking of.)

Most, however, say he should traveling the traditional way — you know, working to earn money then paying businesses for their services.

Just leave the begging to the farangs, one user suggested.

“There are so many farangs who travel this way … There are so many who come to Thailand and work illegally. They don’t benefit our society at all. And now us locals have the same idea? Don’t be like them [the foreigners].”

With food waste in Australia becoming a bigger issue every day, and the government beginning to invest millions in their 2030 target of halving Australia’s US$14 billion dollar waste bill, more eyes than ever are on new and inventive food waste reducing tactics. These bloggers are ahead of the game, with inspiring strategies and ideas to cut down on your food waste. So, here are five zero food waste bloggers to inspire you on your journey towards sustainable living.

Trash is for Tossers

Lauren Singer started her zero waste lifestyle journey back in 2012 and has since produced very little garbage, as she shows on her blog Trash is for Tossers. She posts about how best to compost, how to make zero waste dog treats, and even general cooking tips, like “How To Cook and Bake with Common Kitchen Waste Items.” Her aim is to diligently recycle and compost everything and send nothing to the landfill. She’s gained support on social media with over 115K followers on Facebook, more than 17K followers on Twitter, and over 265K followers on Instagram.

“I believe that if I am going to take nutrients from the earth (through consuming food) that I should put them back (by diligently composting).”

And she doesn’t stop there—Lauren’s zero waste policy extends to other areas, as she runs the Package Free Shop, which sells products that help people reduce their waste. The online store sells anything and everything from Zero Waste Oral Hygiene and Shave kits to Cleaning and Shopping Market kits. She also posts blog articles about recycling clothes and zero waste beauty routines.

Treading My Own Path

Lindsay Miles’ blog Treading My Own Path is a rich smorgasbord of eco-friendly how-tos; with blog posts about decluttering and minimalism, as well as recipes for treats like almond butter and roasted chickpeas. She also offers shopping how-tos, like how to bulk-shop properly and how to eliminate plastic from the shopping process. She includes personal experience stories to help inspire people who are struggling with cutting down on waste and admits she’s not perfect in her goal to live sustainably (she doesn’t enjoy recycling and she had a journey from being a hoarder to a minimalist).

Lindsay extends her zero food waste goals beyond the online world, as she offers workshops and courses that help people in her community take action to reduce their waste. She has also spoken about living with less waste at TEDx Events and wrote a free eBook that is a beginners guide to living with less plastic.

Going Zero Waste

Going Zero Waste aims to inspire people to live as sustainably as they can, not just by minimizing food waste, but in all facets of their life. Kathryn Kellogg provides tips on her blog from large-scale tactics, like rejigging all of your kitchen utensils to being eco-friendly and going plastic-free when you shop, all the way down to bringing a handkerchief with you everywhere you go so that you’ll never need a tissue. She says people often don’t think enough about the cost of convenience.

“Zero waste isn’t just about fighting to keep this stuff out of landfills. And, it definitely isn’t about recycling. It’s fighting to reduce our need and dependence for these types of conveniences.”

Kathryn is also one of the few eco-bloggers who has taken on the challenge of producing only a small mason jar’s worth of trash in a year. She writes across many areas, including topics like how to go zero waste with roommates or when you’re living with parents and how to live a more sustainable lifestyle while still being able to order takeout and dine at restaurants. She’s also delved into more niche topics like zero waste holidays, zero waste weddings, and owning a zero waste dog. In the way of food, her recipes section is extensive, with zero waste recipes for iced tea, brownie bliss balls, smoothies, tacos, and wraps; as well as entire meal plans so you can take your whole diet into the zero waste zone.

The Zero-Waste Chef

This zero food waste blogger is all about amazing food that doesn’t cost the earth. Anne Marie Bonneau is the name behind The Zero-Waste Chef. Her recipes page is diverse with a focus on fermentation recipes and she is a big fan of home-made sourdough. Her more popular recipes include Use-It-Up Vegan Apple Crumble, Tomato Paste from Scratch, and a Waste Nothing Beet Pickles recipes.

She posts articles about how to live life more sustainably, like this piece about going plastic free. Anne is also realistic about her impact on the environment. Despite her zero-waste efforts, she recognizes that until she ‘buys that farm’ there are some things she simply can’t cook without buying some cooking products that require a little packaging. “While zero waste may be possible to reach in my home, my activities will still produce waste indirectly elsewhere.”

Litterless

Founder of Litterless, Celia Ristow, is all about the utensils you need to achieve a zero waste status. With everything from reusable cloths, mesh produce bags, reusable ziplocs, and wooden dish brushes to menstrual cups, bamboo toothbrushes, sustainable makeup products, and compostable dental floss; Littlerless is a product guide for living the zero-waste life. She also provides a hub for eBook resources and local workshops.

Ultimately, if you are struggling to work more ethical and sustainable foods into your diet, there’s always room to compromise by investing in sustainable utensils and durable containers, jars, and bottles, so that you never find yourself buying single-use plastics. There are some great recipes that require ingredients with very little packaging, or reusable packaging if you’re looking for something cheap, simple, and tasty that doesn’t wreak havoc on the planet!
