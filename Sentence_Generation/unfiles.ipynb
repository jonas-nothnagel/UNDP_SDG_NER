       "<s n=\"24\"> It should be noted, in this connection, that in December 1974 the Council decided to make its report shorter and more concise, without changing its basic structure (see Official Records of the Security Council, Twenty-ninth Year, Supplement for October, November and December 1974, document S/11586). </s>\n",
       "<s n=\"25\"> Moreover, in January 1985, the Council agreed, in keeping with the spirit of its 1974 decision, to discontinue the practice of summarizing documents addressed to the President of the Council or to the Secretary-General and circulated as documents of the Council and instead simply to indicate the subject matter of those documents which related to the procedure of the Council (see Resolutions and Decisions of the Security Council, 1985, part II, document S/16913). </s>\n",

       "<p n=\"19\">\n",

       "<s n=\"28\"> In March 1995, the Council decided that, in order to make the procedures of the sanctions committees more transparent, the annual report should contain more information about each committee's activities (S/1995/234). </s>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p n=\"21\">\n",
       "<s n=\"29\"> In August 1996, the Council established new procedures for the deletion of matters that had not been considered by the Council in the preceding five years from the list of matters of which the Council is seized (S/1996/603 and S/1996/704). </s>\n",
       "<s n=\"30\"> Pursuant to the procedure set out in those notes by the President of the Council, several items have been deleted from the list of matters of which the Council is seized (see appendix XIII). </s>\n",

       "<s n=\"32\"> As set out in the note by the President of the Security Council of 12 June 1997 (S/1997/451), in relation to each subject dealt with by the Council, the report would include, as background, a descriptive list of the decisions, resolutions and presidential statements of the Council for the one-year period preceding the period covered; for the period covered by the report, a description in chronological order of the consideration by the Council of the matter in question and of actions taken by the Council on that item, including descriptions of the decisions, resolutions and presidential statements, and a list of communications received by the Council and reports of the Secretary-General; factual data, including dates of formal meetings and informal consultations at which a subject was discussed; information regarding the work of the subsidiary bodies of the Council, including the sanctions committees; information regarding the documentation and working methods and procedure of the Council; matters brought to the attention of the Council but not discussed by it during the period covered; appendices as in previous reports, but also the full texts of all resolutions, decisions and presidential statements adopted or voted upon by the Council during the year in question; and information about meetings with troop-contributing countries. </s>\n",
       "<s n=\"33\"> Brief assessments of the work of the Council, which representatives who had completed their functions as President of the Security Council might wish to prepare, under their own responsibility and following consultations with members of the Council, for the month during which they presided, and which should not be considered as representing the views of the Council would be attached, as an addendum to the report. </s>\n",
       "<s n=\"34\"> The members also decided that they would continue to consider and to review ways to improve the Council's documentation and procedure, including the provision of special reports as referred to in Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations. </s>\n",
