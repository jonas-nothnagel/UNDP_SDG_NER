Teaming up with developer Madison Energy Investments, Arcadia is building a solar array on Aegean Dr. in Methuen for residents who aren’t able to install solar panels on their homes.

The project, which comes amid a nationwide surge in demand for solar and wind energy, will give Methuen residents the opportunity to choose renewable energy and also see decreases in their utility bills.

A whopping 92% of American households are unfit for rooftop solar panels for a variety of reasons—they may be multi-family homes or located in shady areas. Additionally, solar panels are just plain expensive, and not everyone might qualify for a loan to help install them.

“These standards pose a challenge for residents that want access to renewable energy, but are unable to meet the requirements,” said D.C.-based Arcadia in a statement. Enter the new community solar panel project.

The project is big enough for 50 subscribers, most of whom are low-income ratepayers. The sign-up process takes just two minutes, with no credit requirements or cancellation fees. Arcadia and Madison Energy Investments are helping solar power become available for everyone to be able to afford access to clean energy.

“The future of energy is people-powered, and we look forward to bringing Methuen households hassle-free guaranteed solar savings,” said Kiran Bhatraju, CEO of Arcadia Power, in a statement. “Community solar can, and should, be easy to access for everyone in the state of Massachusetts.”

Arcadia and Madison Energy Investments have 15 additional projects scheduled for 2020. For more information, visit arcadia.com and madisonei.com.","Arcadia, a clean energy company, launched its first Massachusetts community solar project last month in Methuen.

In some parts of the developing world, it can make up a staggering proportion of a household’s energy bill.

“For example, In Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, up to 40% of a household’s income might be spent on energy – 70% of which is just to heat water,” explained Faisal Ghani, founder and chief executive of Edinburgh ‘cleantech’ start-up, SolarisKit. “This is a significant cost to poor households and a strain on grids which are already struggling to meet demand in many parts of Africa.”

A spin-out from Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, SolarisKit has secured around £250,000 of funding to begin trials in Africa of the world’s first flat-packable solar thermal collector. By turning sunlight into heat, this will allow households to save money, while also reducing their carbon emissions.

The funding was awarded through the Energy Catalyst Programme of Innovate UK, the UK innovation agency.

“By the end of this trial project, we aim to install up to 100 of our collectors in Rwanda to demonstrate both the environmental and socio-economic impact achieved from the supply of affordable clean energy,” Mr Ghani said.

Heating currently accounts for around 40% of the world’s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon emissions from developing countries exceeding those from its modern counterparts, Mr Ghani said.

By focusing on the development of low-cost, high-value solar technology, the company’s goal is to lower global carbon emissions while helping to improve the lives of millions of people in the developing world, particularly in sub Saharan Africa, as well as parts of Asia and Latin America.

Assembled in 30 minutes, the SolarisKit solar collector is small, lightweight and can be transported by bicycle or motorcycle – presenting a potential business opportunity for local entrepreneurs to start their own clean energy business with just a bicycle and trailer.

In most standard weather conditions, the SolarisKit is capable of heating water to temperatures of up to 50 degrees C, perfect for normal showering and laundry requirements.

SolarisKit can significantly reduce the cost to purchase, transport, and install a solar hot water system.","In some parts of the developing world, it can make up a staggering proportion of a household’s energy bill.

4,https://www.startribune.com/a-conversation-with-jacob-frey/566879322/,"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Minneapolis Star Tribune,"From affordable housing to feud with President Trump, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey reflects on 2nd year","The Minneapolis mayor talks to Star Tribune reporter Liz Navratil about his second year in office, President Donald Trump, and what’s next for the city. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: You’re wrapping your second year. How have things changed? How have you changed as a mayor?

A: The professional responsibility as a mayor you largely anticipate. But there are certain things that happen in the job that there is no playbook for. There’s no playbook for getting phone calls at 3:30 in the morning that someone has been shot and killed or a building full of low-income residents is on fire. There is no playbook for the emotional toll that running a city takes not just on a professional life but also on your personal life. As mayor, you experience acutely both the joys and the trauma of a city. And that’s tough. And so over the last couple years, having those experiences has made me a better mayor, has made me a better person. And going to the next two years, I feel we’re stacked full of momentum.

Q: So going into 2020, what do you want to do with that momentum? What will your biggest priorities be?

A: I’m proud to say that the things that I promised when I was campaigning for office are happening. We promised heavy investment in affordable housing. We promised record production of deeply affordable and low-income housing units. We’ve done that. We’ve got a new program that is innovative and groundbreaking in Stable Homes, Stable Schools, in which just in the first six months or so, we have 600 people that are being helped by the program and 457 people that either were homeless or were on the verge of experiencing homelessness now have stability both at their home and in the classroom. We promised to push for beautifully diverse neighborhoods in every sense of the word and passed a groundbreaking comprehensive plan, a first in the nation. That’s just the area of housing. We promised progress in the areas of economic inclusion, and we’ve got a commercial property development fund that is allowing communities of color to reap the benefits of economic development when it comes to their neighborhoods that they’ve made wonderful to begin with. We set up cultural districts that highlight that which sets these wonderful communities apart. In the area of police-community relations, we promised both accountability and transparency, and just to give you one example here, we saw body camera usage go from 55% approximately when I took office to around 95% now.

Q: On affordable housing, that’s obviously an issue we keep hearing about. And the city, as you mentioned, is doing more investment in affordable housing, but the city also just passed one of its largest property tax increases in a decade. Is there a contradiction there, and what will you do as mayor to ensure that homeowners can stay in their homes?

A: Property taxes are a regressive tax. They have a disproportionate impact on people of lower incomes and seniors. And we’ve seen that for years, in fact for decades, the federal government has not put the necessary funding into affordable and public housing … That has caused an undue strain and burden on cities. It’s not unique to Minneapolis. We’re seeing it all throughout the country. A lot of these more difficult, controversial and at times costly issues get passed to cities, are getting pushed under the rug, and who ends up being the rug? Well, cities. I’m proud, though, that at the same time cities around the country, and particularly Minneapolis, has stepped up to the challenge. We’ve become a laboratory of democracy, where new and innovative approaches can take place and we’ve become a city that is willing to grapple with tough and controversial policies and issues when others look the other way. And so these issues of affordable housing and economic inclusion, police-community relations for that matter, these are tough issues, and if you look through the history of our city and our country, you could spend 20 years on these issues and not see a 100% conclusion. But, the data speaks for itself, and we are making clear progress. We have seen over 1,000 units of new, low-income housing in production this year, which is a record.

Q: Some people are wondering, OK, we’re investing in affordable housing, but property taxes are also going up for homeowners. So how do you balance that?

A: First, some of the funding on affordable housing was one-time, which does not lead to a property tax hike. But second, yes, there is a balancing act to play. I believe strongly in creating and having beautifully diverse neighborhoods and I believe strongly that everyone has a right to live in a great city. And that right is not available to large swaths of the population and the values go up and rents continue to rise. So we’re investing strategically in partnership with our state government which has other taxing authorities that allow for that balance to be struck.

A big highlight in my budget this year was not necessarily as sexy and doesn’t necessarily get the press, but we made tough decisions this year that will prevent taxes from going up as much as they otherwise would in subsequent years.

Q: Can you walk me through that?

A: Sure. So, we’re required to have, I believe it’s 1%, of our general fund revenues devoted to our contingency fund. And that contingency fund was funded in part, substantially on a one-time basis. We brought that into an ongoing [basis], because I don’t believe that a contingency fund should be subject to competing with other more sexy but not necessarily more important items. Ensuring the long-term fiscal stability of the city has to be a top priority. We were more conservative with projections for development fees in future years, and making that decision will help protect us against economic downturns, and the inevitable cyclical nature of an economy in the future. I spent a whole lot of time advocating with the state to ensure that the city was not bearing an undue amount of the MERF [Minneapolis Employee Retirement Fund] and PERA [Public Employees Retirement Association of Minnesota] funding. We helped create a plan for the future that would fund neighborhood associations. Thankfully, we’ve created a good plan for the future.

Q: We had two tragedies in one month at apartment buildings that served people who are low income or who are homeless. And a lot of folks have started talking more about safety measures for them. What role do you think a mayor should play in those conversations, and how would you ensure that people in those situations have the safest housing possible?

A: I start from the premise that housing is a right. Everyone should be able to go home at night to a home, to rest their head on a pillow and to rejuvenate for the next day, and clearly that right is not available to everyone. And, yes, in the last month, we’ve had difficult and traumatic events that have tested the very fabric and mentality on which our city is built.

First, the city’s primary function is ensuring safety, and I’m so proud of our firefighters who ran, quite literally, into a burning building, and due to their work and bravery we had … no loss of life and no serious injuries [in the Drake Hotel fire on Christmas Day]. I can’t thank them enough. The building code as you know is a state-based piece of legislation. And I have a feeling that your next question is probably going to be about sprinklers.

Q: Yep.

A: Of course, I would like to see all buildings outfitted with the necessary safety precautions, so something like this never happens. In instances like with public housing, I also don’t want to see an unfunded mandate or by an entity that is already substantially in arrears.

Q: You talked about police-community relations. You go to a public meeting and you’ll see people raising concerns about various departmental policies, and racial inequities. Do you think there are changes that need to occur in the police department and, if so, what would you change?

A: Yes. Our Chief [Medaria] Arradondo is leading a full-scale culture shift in the way our Minneapolis police department does business. He has acknowledged the wrongs and pain of the past, and he’s made commitments of improvement to the future. I full-heartedly support our chief. If you look at the work that we have done around accountability, there’s numerous different facets. We started right off the bat with the body camera policy. That’s progress. We banned warrior training, which was controversial and it was a first-in-the nation initiative, but it was the right thing to do. Officers shouldn’t be going into every interaction with the supposition that an individual was deemed a threat until proven otherwise, and prohibiting warrior training both on and off duty was a step in the right direction there. We entirely revamped our sexual assault policy, making sure that it was victim-centered and trauma informed. We’ve added a victim advocate in our interactions. More recently, there was the bringing our police department into line with almost every other major city throughout the country, which was prohibiting the wearing of uniforms when endorsing political candidates.

Q: Is there anything left on your to-do list in the police department?

A: Yes. There is work still to be done. The cornerstone of what Chief Arradondo is pushing for right now is procedural justice and, as we are seeing, the best way to see that shift is to allow our chief to train in new officers from the very beginning with the mentality and methodology that he has set forth. We saw the beginning stages of that in this recent budget, where we previously had two recruiting classes; now we will have three recruiting classes. We talk about officers, we’re not talking about just adding any officers. We’re talking about adding officers that are groomed from the very beginning with procedural justice baked into every interaction, with the necessary culture that our Chief Arradondo has instilled from the get-go and that are ready to serve with the integrity that he talks about. And, so that’s a change. Does it take time? Yes. But, I mean, it’s one that’s worth it.

We’re also looking at reforms as to how officers do off-duty work. As you may know, in addition to the work on duty in uniform, there is also work that officers are doing when they’re hired by private entities. And there are many ramifications of having that work be a substantial segment of their overall workload. We’ve got a whole plan in place right now to see how we can improve it.

I believe that our Minneapolis police department should be a reflection of our city, and you can’t have an accurate reflection without diversity. If you look at our recent police department recruiting classes, they’re diverse. And they are full-heartedly signed up to the vision and mentality laid out by Chief Arradondo. That, in and of itself, does begin to create a culture shift.

Q: The city recently declared a climate emergency, following a report that said it wasn’t on track to meet its 2050 goals. What role should a city play in fighting climate change?

A: When you have a federal government that’s pulling itself from the Paris climate agreements, it’s on the shoulders of cities to step up. When you have gridlock at the state and federal levels and you have people that are moving back to cities in huge rates, cities are placed in a position where they can transform the way they operate to reduce the per capita carbon footprint. And making a declaration is one thing. Taking the necessary action steps to change the projections for the better is another. And so we’ve got a number of initiatives that are underway right now in terms of sustainability and reducing carbon output. I’m happy to talk about those.

First, let me say that if you read … Janette Sadik-Khan, she was the transportation and public works head of New York City. She said, “You want to save the environment, you move to New York City.” The same mentality applies to Minneapolis. Simply living in the city, allowing for additional density and housing in our city is one mechanism in and of itself that reduces your carbon footprint. You don’t have a 45-minute commute in from the suburbs. You can live in a building that allows the heating not just of one single-family home but many. That was one, and that’s baked into the comprehensive plan. The green business cost-sharing program gives businesses the necessary assistance and resources to retool their entity, allowing for necessary reductions. That program, by the way, is funded in part through a plan that attaches fees to pollution. So, several years ago, I introduced an ordinance that tacked fees to pollution. For every pound of pollution that’s emitted into the atmosphere, there is now a fee. And in just one year alone, it reduced the carbon output by about 6 million pounds, and the criteria pollutant output by 18,000 pounds. Now, those numbers have dramatically grown since then, because that was now three or four years ago. And, the fees that are collected then get dumped directly back into environmentally sustainable work. Additionally, we got the American Cities Climate Challenge award, along with St. Paul, and that award will allow us to expedite some of the work already underway. One example are these bus-only lanes, and so we’ve got bus-only lanes now that are on Hennepin, making it even easier and more efficient to get from Point A to Point B in an environmentally sustainable fashion. There is a lot of other work going underway. I’m thinking about the energy disclosures for buildings that are now required and are in place. There’s the work that’s happening over at our clean energy partnership that’s making some strides right now. We’ve got a long way to go on the environment, but there’s no — I can’t think of a more worthy task than saving the planet.

Q: We can’t really talk about 2019 without mentioning the Trump rally. You got a lot of attention for asking the president to pay costs related to his campaign rally, and some folks had criticized you, wondering if that was a publicity stunt, since the city didn’t have an extensive track record of charging other folks. Was it? And would you do anything different?

A: First, let me say I’m proud of how the city as a whole handled the situation. We stood on our values, noting that we believe diversity is a strength. We stood up for our population, for our communities that we knew full well would get attacked with really hateful rhetoric from our president. And, I’m proud of how our city presented on the national stage and they saw a whole lot of really hateful rhetoric. We stood up and we were quite simply Minneapolis. We were ourselves, and I’m proud of that. Secondly, we handled a very difficult and controversial rally. We kept everyone safe. We made sure that our city was protected and that people felt supported.

We found out that Donald Trump was coming to town. Our city coordinator came and had what was maybe a three-minute meeting. He was sitting right in the seat where you’re sitting now. He says, “What do you want me to do?” I said, “Well, recover what costs you can.” That was it. We didn’t ask for this. We weren’t looking for some sort of fight. Then, I don’t know five, six days later, whatever it ended up being, I get back from a run, about to jump in the shower and I get a phone call or a text, I don’t remember, from I think him [one of his press officers] saying that the president of the United States is tweeting about our city and you as the mayor.

Q: One of your more interesting moments in office, right?

A: It was bizarre. I mean, I’m a mayor of a city that has a population of 435,000 people, and I don’t have the time to be tweeting out garbage. I’m working on affordable housing and potholes and economic inclusion. So, the notion that a president with this massive population, massive constituency has the time to be tweeting at me is ridiculous.

I work my tail off every day, often with little publicity on issues like affordable housing and filling potholes. But the national scene has this weird incentive structure where the work and the results almost get less credence than the clever tweet. That’s perhaps a societal trend that’s frustrating to me. And it signals, I think, the need to kind of make politics not about being somebody but about doing something.

Q: You had mentioned after this that you wanted the city to come up with some sort of policy for how to handle these costs in the future. Have you guys made any progress on that?

A: There are parts of this that I can’t talk about due to legal ramifications.

Q: Are those discussions still happening?

A: They are. I’m trying to think of what I’m able to say. One of the good things that came out of this is we were able to shine a light on a persistent problem that many cities around the country, not just Minneapolis, are experiencing and that’s this difficult scenario where municipalities are forced to bear the costs and the burden of hosting presidential campaign rallies.

Q: It was around that time that the “hot mayor” discussion went viral online. Some folks have also made comments about your looks at different public hearings. Do you feel like you get objectified, and does that change the way you do your job in any way?

A: To answer your first question, yes. To answer the second question, no.

Q: Have you had a most difficult day on the job, and maybe a most rewarding day on the job?

A: Good question. I’ll give you the most difficult issue. It was definitely the homeless encampment. The level of complexity built on centuries of genocide and historical trauma resulted in many things, but one of them is homelessness in our Indigenous community, our Native community. And working with approximately 12 different tribes in our urban American Indian community, activists and multiple jurisdictions to find a solution and engage in a process that was Native-led was tough. But it was also one of the more rewarding in that we were able to dramatically improve the positive outcomes from approximately 15% placement in housing, which is what our homeless shelters normally see on an annual basis, to around 50%.

Q: Are you running for re-election?

A: I fully anticipate and plan to.

Q: What else is it crucial for folks to know?

A: We’re going into 2020 with a … ton of momentum, and it’s because the things that we promised when I ran for election are very much underway. We’re also finding ways to be innovative and there’s a number of firsts that we put forward in these first couple of years, not just firsts in Minneapolis, but in some cases first in the state, first in the country. We have our first cash bail alternatives program, which is funded in this year’s budget and will be underway in 2020. I mentioned Stable Homes, Stable Schools already, and the 2040 Comprehensive Plan, where we got rid of single-family exclusive zoning, also a first which is now being copied throughout many cities and states are attempting to replicate it throughout the country. We have a hospital-based intervention system for opioid use, which is also a first here. And, in fact, these firsts have become somewhat of a regularity.","We promised heavy investment in affordable housing.

State officials and community leaders on Wednesday celebrated the grand opening of The GMDC Ozone Park Industrial Center that will provide affordable rental space to small businesses, artisans, makers and other local entrepreneurs.

Guests included Empire State Development (ESD), New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Enterprise Community Partners, NYCEDC’s President, James Patchett, as well as nonprofit industrial developer Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center (GMDC), Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Councilwoman Adrienne Adams.

“I am so proud to have the new GMDC Ozone Park Industrial Center, a first-class industrial work space, in my district to increase quality industrial jobs and economic development,” Adams said. “This previously unused space has been transformed to a gem for the community that will bring quality living wage jobs to Queens residents.”

The new Ozone Park Industrial Center, spread over three buildings and spanning an entire city block, located at 101-01 95th Ave., provides 85,000 square feet of affordable industrial space that will be leased to local woodworkers, artisans, custom fabricators and other entrepreneurs. The building will house more than two dozen manufacturing businesses, providing approximately 80 jobs at the facility.

The project supports Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s efforts to revitalize New York’s manufacturing sector and support small businesses.

“The new GMDC Ozone Park Industrial Center builds on our economic development strategy by transforming a historic structure into space that will allow manufacturers to thrive in Queens,” Hochul said. “Supported by significant state investment, this project embraces our past and charts a course for the future focused on job growth, innovation and the continued rebirth of manufacturing across New York.”

The rehabilitated building achieved LEED certification and roughly two-thirds of construction workers were based in Brooklyn and Queens. It was originally built in 1906 as the Spear & Company Factory, and originally produced hats and wax novelty items. The building later housed the Worksman bicycle company.

GMDC, New York City’s premier nonprofit industrial developer, spent $42 million to purchase and rehabilitate the property, representing one of the largest investments in Ozone Park in recent history. It is the company’s first location outside of Brooklyn and the building is now listed on both the New York State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places.

“GMDC is grateful for the strong support the state of New York has provided to our Ozone Park project,” said Brian T. Coleman, CEO of Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center Local Development Corporation. “Funding from ESD, subsidy from NYSERDA and historic tax credits from SHPO were vital to the completion of our project.”

The project was supported by nearly $11 million from New York state, including a $2.1 million grant from Empire State Development, $8.8 million in state and federal historic preservation tax credits administered by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and $39,000 from NYSERDA to support solar power installations on the building’s roof.

“Supporting energy efficient technologies and renewable energy resources as part of historic renovations demonstrates New York’s commitment to fostering economy-wide carbon neutrality as we build cleaner, healthier communities for all and protect our natural environment under Governor Cuomo’s clean energy and climate goals,” said Alicia Barton, president and CEO of NYSERDA.

The GMDC Ozone Park Industrial Center also received a $10 million grant from New York City’s Industrial Developer Fund as well as a $3.7 million loan through the Industrial Developer Loan Fund. In addition, $2.3 million in city property tax benefits were provided through the NYC Industrial Development Agency.

State Senator James Sanders Jr. said, “I am hopeful that the new project will create much-needed good-paying jobs, while helping to re-energize our local economy and re-purpose an empty factory. This project is a good example of how government and non-profits working together can produce positive results.”

Tenants are expected to begin occupying the space on a full-time basis in early 2020.","Sign up for our PoliticsNY newsletter for the latest coverage and to stay informed about the 2021 elections in your district and across NYCState officials and community leaders on Wednesday celebrated the grand opening of The GMDC Ozone Park Industrial Center that will provide affordable rental space to small businesses, artisans, makers and other local entrepreneurs.

Greenlight Communities is planning four projects in the Phoenix area that will offer monthly rent $300-$500 less than at comparable buildings, according to a press release.

Cabana Washington, located near the Loop 202 Red Mountain Freeway and Washington Street in Phoenix, will begin leasing its 226 units this month and moving in residents in April.

Cabana 12th, near 12th Street and Indian School Road in Phoenix, will have 252 units and follow the same timeline.

The developer also has plans for a complex near Hayden Road and Oak Street in Scottsdale, expected to open this winter, and a Mesa location near Power and Williams Field roads expected to open in spring 2021.

The complexes will offer studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments and will not be built with any government money, according to the company.

Greenlight Communities said in the release it keeps rent relatively low by streamlining building costs and eliminating expensive extras for residents.

The developer owns its own construction company and employs all of its contractors, which it says saves it money.

“We want to provide teachers, health care workers, first responders and every Arizonan earning a working wage, a home that they can afford in a community they love,” Greenlight co-founder Patricia Watts said in the release.

“When we looked at what is truly affordable … in the market right now, the product simply does not exist.”

Carl Lis OBE, chair of National Parks England, has warned that young people and national parks staff are being forced out of some of the most scenic parts of the country by high prices, driven in part by exclusive holiday homes.

In an interview with the Guardian, Lis said the government should also take action on “land banking” by developers in protected areas such as the Lake District, the South Downs and the Peak District, so-called because property speculators hoard plots with planning permission for years to maximise profits.

Lis, who is also chair of the Yorkshire Dales authority, said more should be done to attract people from a range of backgrounds to England’s most beautiful areas after a government-commissioned report warned visitors to parks are “exclusive, mainly white, mainly middle‑class club”.

Lis told the Guardian: “The simple fact is that we have a problem in the Dales, as do an awful lot of national parks, that an awful lot of houses are now second homes. Some of them [the owners] are brilliant and come every weekend. They’re a major part of our economy, our local shops, local pubs. But there are some that are only occupied twice a year perhaps.

“When you couple that with the fact that young people can’t afford to live in the park at my authority in the dales … our employees that work with us can’t afford to live in the national park … The obvious solution is to build more affordable homes.”

House prices in some English national parks are more than double the regional average, according to research by Hamptons International. The average house price in the New Forest is £622,670 in the past year, often pricing out young families and the park workers.

Lis was behind a proposal in the Yorkshire Dales to increase tax on second homes fivefold, although it was opposed by the local district council.

Lis said more needed to be done to aid the development of genuinely affordable housing in national parks, calling on the government to stop property developers land banking and ensure homes get built once planning permission is given.

“In terms of houses, I think what is important is the situation as far as developers just being able to hang on to land with planning for permission as long as they can,” he added.

Last year, a government-commissioned report led by the writer Julian Glover into the future of England’s protected landscapes, criticised national parks for not doing enough to make people welcome. Lis said parks would do more to attract a wider range of visitors.

“It’s part of our overall strategy to be open for everyone. People think you only get middle-class, white people [in the parks]. We’ve recently got data that suggests we’re improving in that area and our challenge is to try and improve the number of BAME people we have coming round,” he said.

“We need to be attractive to every single part of our population. The national parks are the breathing spaces where people can benefit from peace and tranquility. The pure beauty of landscapes. It’s incumbent on us, as our second purpose of the authority, that we encourage all people to come and visit.”

Despite the aim of attracting a more diverse array of visitors, the head of the Lake District national park authority was accused of using the issue to push through commercial development schemes which could jeopardise its Unesco world heritage status.

Earlier this month, plans to moor holiday boats on the shores of Grasmere in the Lake District national park were withdrawn after thousands of protesters planned to oppose the proposals. The park is also facing a judicial review over its refusal to ban 4x4s and motorbikes amid concerns it was ruining the tranquility of the area.","More affordable housing should be built in England’s national parks to help communities excluded by spiralling prices driven by second homes, the new chair for the authorities has said.

Lower-priced shampoos leave hair feeling squeaky clean, but that squeak often means there are sulfates in the ingredients, which strip hair of natural oils, leaving it dry, brittle and worse-for-wear.

Top-notch hair-care typically comes with a hefty price tag: Whether you buy it at the salon or on the top shelf of your beauty store, quality drives prices higher, with many shampoos and conditioners ringing in around the $20 range.

Then, there's the natural stuff, which usually has a thick, gloopy texture and doesn't quite stack up to the performance of other products. Despite a lack of sulfates, many products positioned as ""natural"" in the market sneak harmful ingredients and chemicals like parabens into the bottles, which can disrupt your endocrine system.

Lauren Krysti Photographer

When it comes to my preferences, I tend to gravitate towards sulfate-free products because they make my hair softer, but many of them are accompanied by a steep price tag. Because my hair is very long (nearly down to my waist) I go through products pretty rapidly and can’t afford to spend exorbitant amounts on each salon-quality product, which means I settle for less-than-ideal quality to stretch my dollar. On top of this, I always look for my beauty products to be both cruelty-free and vegan, which adds another hurdle to my already crowded list of wants.

The Search is Over

I've spent the past few years looking for an affordable haircare line that delivers results without any sulfates or harmful chemicals. This past week, I was lucky enough to be one of the first to try out Odele Beauty, which launched exclusively at Target on January 26th.

Let me just say: I finally found it.

Affordable? Check. Odele rings in at just $11.99 per product.

Effective? Check. My hair has never been this shiny and manageable.

Naturally-formulated? Check. Odele's products are free of sulfates, formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, dyes, synthetic fragrances, and all of the 1,328+ cosmetic ingredients banned by the European Union. ""[Odele is] also vegan, cruelty-free, allergy tested, and dermatologist tested so you're getting a safe, reliable and effective hair care experience.""

After just a couple days of washing my hair with the Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair felt softer, less frizzy and shinier than it had when using any of my previous products. My hair, which was dull, lifeless and limp, sprang to life with Odele. The Leave-In Conditioner nourished my split ends and kept my typically wiry texture at bay.

Even after using their products for just a week, Odele has already started to improve my routine: It takes me a fraction of the time to get ready in the morning because my hair no longer needs hot tools to look presentable, and I no longer have a halo of frizz, thanks to the Air Styler, which turns air-dried hair from disorderly to sleek with just a dime-sized application.

Odele's Philosophy

Like their products, Odele Beauty's philosophy is equally as incredible: Odele is a women-founded company that aims to deliver clean, gender-neutral, salon-quality haircare at an accessible price tag. The goal is to simplify shower-time by offering lines of shampoo, conditioner and styling products that target specific needs and hair types.

Whether you're looking for Curl Defining, Smoothing or Volumizing, there's an Odele product formulated specifically for you and everyone in your family. Their formulas boast ""100% natural fragrance [that] is ungendered, and our products are developed based on needs by hair type; not by gender, age, or any other measure."" So next time you're at Target, captivated by all of the gorgeous trinkets that you don't really need, head over to the beauty aisle grab something you do: clean, affordable, cruelty-free hair care that truly works.","When searching for hair care, it seems like we’re always forced to pick only one: affordable, effective, or naturally-formulated.

What would it have taken to protect the vehicles from AK-47s? In [PrepTech]’s three-part DIY composite vehicle armor tutorial, he shows how he was able to make his own bulletproof armor from scratch. Even if you think the whole complete-collapse-of-civilization thing is a little far-fetched, you’ve got to admit that’s pretty cool.

The first part deals with actually building the composite. He uses layers of stainless steel, ceramic mosaic tiles, and fiberglass, as well as epoxy resin in order to build the composite. The resin was chosen for its high three-dimensional cross-linked density, while the fiberglass happened to be the most affordable composite fabric. Given the nature of the tiny shards produced from cutting fiberglass, extreme care must be taken so that the shards don’t end up in your clothes or face afterwards. Wearing a respirator and gloves, as well as a protective outer layer, can help.

After laminating the fabric, it hardens to the point where individual strands become stiff. The next layer – the hard ceramic – works to deform and slow down projectiles, causing it to lose around 40% of its kinetic energy upon impact. He pipes silicone between the tiles to increase the flexibility. Rather than using one large tile, which can only stand one impact, [PrepTech] uses a mosaic of tiles, allowing multiple tiles to be hit without affecting the integrity of surrounding tiles. While industrial armor uses boron or silicon carbide, ceramic is significantly lower cost.

The stainless steel is sourced from a scrap junkyard and cut to fit the dimensions of the other tiles before being epoxied to the rest of the composite. The final result is allowed to sit for a week to allow the epoxy to fully harden before being subject to ballistics tests. The plate was penetrated by a survived shots from a Glock, Škorpion vz. 61, and AK-47, but was penetrated by the Dragunov sniper rifle. Increasing the depth of the stainless steel to at least a centimeter of ballistic grade steel may have helped protect the plate from higher calibers, but [PrepTech] explained that he wasn’t able to obtain the material in his country.

Nevertheless, the lower calibers were still unable to puncture even the steel, so unless you plan on testing out the plate on high caliber weapons, it’s certainly a success for low-cost defense tools.","In [PrepTech]’s three-part DIY composite vehicle armor tutorial, he shows how he was able to make his own bulletproof armor from scratch.

Since 2007, more than half the houses developed in Dallas have been priced above $350,000, city staff said.

Because the housing inventory hasn’t kept up with Dallas’ population growth, fewer homes are available for middle-to low-income earners, according to the city. And cheaper homes are aging, with few options for families to renovate them.

City officials said a new program could help change that.

The Dallas City Council on Wednesday approved an initiative aimed at keeping residents who would have otherwise been priced out of Dallas. Staffers will create seven residential areas, called Neighborhood Empowerment Zones, where property owners can qualify for tax breaks if they build affordable houses or renovate old homes.

While Dallas already has 10 such zones for commercial development, this is the city’s first initiative targeting residential neighborhoods.

Staffers focused on areas throughout the city that they believe are at a “tipping point” — surrounded by spiking property values but marked by many homes in disrepair and residents vulnerable to displacement.

""This is an exciting day for affordable housing,” said City Council member Chad West, who represents part of Oak Cliff and heads the council’s Housing and Homelessness Solutions Committee.

The city will invest $1 million from its Housing Trust Fund and will lose $1.9 million in tax revenue over 10 years, according to staff. They expect 125 homes to be renovated and 75 new ones to be built under the program, which targets households that make 120% of the area’s median income or less — about $100,000 for a family of four.

In return, the city said, the program would generate about $25 million in private investment. The trust fund dollars would be used to reimburse developer fees up to $50,000.

Applicants can qualify for the tax breaks if:

A developer builds a new house on a lot that’s vacant, about to be demolished, or purchased through the city’s land bank program and sold to an eligible household;

An investor or homeowner spends at least $5,000 to renovate an eligible house, through weather proofing or other essential systems;

A property owner spends at least $10,000 to bring a single-family unit or duplex up to code for eligible households.

Eligible households include renters at or below 80% of the area median income, homeowners at or below 120% of the area median income, or home buyers from the city’s land bank program.

David Noguera, director of housing and neighborhood revitalization, said at a council briefing last week that the program is just one tool.

Staffers said the city will still need more investment if it wants to make a bigger impact. And they want to implement other programs that would help address the significant need as low-income Dallas residents struggle to find homes.

“It’s not the silver bullet for affordable housing,” Noguera said.

The city currently has 10 commercial Neighborhood Empowerment Zones, which offer tax breaks for certain commercial projects. Last year, the city provided more than $500,000 in tax exemptions for such projects.

Michael Mendoza, director of the Office of Economic Development, said the new residential zones would test the program’s effectiveness as an incentive for development.

Council member Casey Thomas, who represents southern Dallas, said the city needs this tool to help prevent gentrification.

“We have not had enough housing stock opportunities. This is us rolling out the welcome mat,” Thomas said. “I think this is critically important in order for us to make Dallas the type of Dallas we can all be proud of.”","Only 2% of Dallas-Fort Worth’s newly built owner-occupied homes under $300,000 fall within the Dallas city limits.

If you’re thinking about investing in a beach town property – whether to rent out or use as a vacation home for yourself – you might quickly realize that not every city by the ocean may be the right fit. With lots of factors to consider, such as mortgage payments, property taxes and amount of space, SmartAsset crunched the numbers to find the most affordable beach towns in the U.S.

We looked at data for 219 waterfront cities across four metrics: median home value, average number of rooms per house, median property taxes paid and monthly housing costs. For details on our data sources and how we put all the information together to create our final rankings, check out our Data and Methodology section below.

This is SmartAsset’s fifth annual study on the most affordable beach towns in America. Check out the 2019 version here.

Key Findings

Mississippi, Florida and Texas. The top 10 most affordable beach towns in our study are all located in the South, specifically in three states. Four of the cities are located in Mississippi, four in Florida and two in Texas.

Low property taxes. Current and potential homeowners alike can take advantage of the relatively low property taxes in the top 10 cities. All 10 cities rank within the top 12% of the study for this metric and the average amount paid in property taxes across these cities is $1,154, compared to an average of $8,453 across the bottom 10 cities in the study.

1. Gulfport, MS

Gulfport, Mississippi ranks as the most affordable beach town in America, with top-10 figures in three of the four metrics we considered. It ranks in the top 10 of the study for three out of the four metrics we considered. The median home value in Gulfport is $120,600, the fourth-lowest value for this metric in the study. Furthermore, the city has the fifth-lowest figure in the study for monthly housing costs, at $833, and the 10th-lowest figure for median property taxes paid, at $1,006.

2. Biloxi, MS

Story continues

Located on the Gulf of Mexico, Biloxi, Mississippi has top-15 rates for its relatively low median home value and median property taxes paid, at $156,700 and $1,093, respectively. Furthermore, the city has a top-five rate for its low monthly housing costs, at $809, making it a great potential spot to invest in a beach town property.

3. Pensacola, FL (tie)

Pensacola, Florida ties for third place with Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. It ranks in the top 25% of the study for all four metrics we examined. It has the 15th-lowest median home value in the study, at $165,700. It ranks 19th-best for the metrics of median property taxes paid, at $1,234, and monthly housing costs, at $932. Furthermore, it has the second-highest average number of rooms per house in the top 10, at 6.4.

3. Bay St. Louis, MS (tie)

Tied with Pensacola, Florida for the No. 3 spot, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi ranks particularly well for its low monthly housing costs. In 2018, the median monthly housing costs in the city were $761, the third-lowest in the study. Additionally, Bay St. Louis ranks within the top 10% of all 219 cities we examined for the metrics of median home value, at $170,400, and median property taxes paid, at $1,167.

5. Port Arthur, TX

Located about 100 miles east of Houston, Port Arthur, Texas ranks in the bottom half of the study for its relatively low average number of rooms per house. However, it leads all 219 cities in two other metrics, median home value and monthly housing costs. The median home value in Port Arthur is $65,700, almost two-thirds less than the home value in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, the city in our top 10 with the highest home value. Partly as a result of this, monthly housing costs in Port Arthur are the lowest in the study, at $628.

6. Ocean Springs, MS

The fourth and final Mississippi beach town in our study, Ocean Springs takes the No. 6 spot. The city ranks within the top 20% of the study for all four metrics we considered. Specifically, the median home value there is $165,100 and median property taxes paid total $1,353. Furthermore, Ocean Springs boasts the highest average number of rooms per house across any city in our top 10 – at approximately 6.5 rooms, that’s likely to fit extra family members or guests that are staying with you.

7. Freeport, TX

Located on the Gulf of Mexico about 60 miles south of Houston, Freeport, Texas is similar to Port Arthur in its low median home value and low monthly housing costs, ranking second-best for each of these metrics. Specifically, the median home value in Freeport was $75,700 and median monthly housing costs total were $657 in 2018.

8. Melbourne, FL

Located southeast of Orlando, Melbourne, Florida ranks eighth overall in our study on the most affordable beach towns in the U.S. It ranks within the top 10% of the study for three of the four metrics we considered: median home value ($155,300), median property taxes paid ($1,232) and monthly housing costs ($920).

9. Fort Walton Beach, FL

Although the median home value in Fort Walton Beach, Florida is the least affordable in our top 10, at $179,600, the city still ranks within the top 25 for this metric out of all 219 cities in the study. Those who decide to invest in property in this beach town will likely be able to find a place that is roomy enough, as the average number of rooms per house is 6.3. Median property taxes paid total less than $1,300 and monthly housing costs total $969.

10. Fort Pierce, FL

Fort Pierce, Florida ranks in the bottom 35 of the study for its average number of rooms per house, at 5.3. The city has top-10 rates, however, for three of the other metrics we considered. It has the third-lowest median home value ($100,100) the seventh-lowest monthly housing costs ($842) and the ninth-lowest median property taxes ($924).

Data and Methodology

To find the most affordable beach towns in the U.S., SmartAsset analyzed data for 219 waterfront cities. Specifically, we looked at the following four factors:

Home value. This is the median home value in each city. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s 2018 5-year American Community Survey.

Number of rooms. This is the average number of rooms per house. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s 2018 5-year American Community Survey.

Property taxes. This is the median annual property taxes paid. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s 2018 5-year American Community Survey.

Monthly housing costs. This is the median monthly housing costs. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s 2018 5-year American Community Survey.

We ranked each beach town in every metric, giving a full weighting to all metrics expect for average number of rooms per house, which was half-weighted. We then found each town’s average ranking and used the average to determine a final score. The place with the best average ranking received a score of 100. The place with the lowest average ranking received a score of 0.

Tips for Managing a Mortgage

Make sure you are ready to buy. Investing in property is a big decision, whether you are the one ultimately moving in or renting it out. Be certain of whether you’re ready to buy rather than rent.

Get clarity on how much you can afford. Especially if your beach house is a second home, you want to make sure you’re not straining your finances. Make sure you know how much house you can afford.

Relax and let the experts handle it. Does the thought of managing all of your finances make you want to be lounging on the beach instead? It can all be a breeze with a little help from a financial expert. Finding the right financial advisor that fits your needs doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with financial advisors in your area in five minutes.

Where exactly the Ariya will fit into the market has been the subject of conjecture up until now. Some reports have suggested that it will be an affordable electric crossover sitting just above the Leaf lineup, while others have suggested it might have a luxury-vehicle price tag and an emphasis on performance.

Turns out both of those are correct—well, all except for the high price.

According to Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan’s senior VP for global design, the Ariya will still be seen as an affordable big-brother crossover to the Leaf. “It is still that,” he said, confirming it’s absolutely a global vehicle but avoiding numbers when we asked him about positioning.

Nissan IMx concept, 2017 Tokyo Motor Show

What Albaisa was more eager to talk about in the Ariya, which was preceded by the farther-out IMx concept, was its design—something he was directly involved in—and its performance.

When we asked about the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which will go on sale before the Ariya, and performance-focused EVs like the Porsche Taycan and Rimac C-Two, Albaisa didn’t hesitate to acknowledge their cool factor and explosive performance—and how they’ve changed the face of what performance means.

“Electric motors have changed the world because this idea of a pure 0-60 is less a differentiator,” he said. “How you use it, how you deliver it, what it means, and for the supercars, how many laps you can do, that matters.”

“Naturally it’s exciting,” he said, adding: “Even the real version of Ariya is fast—faster or as fast as a Z car.”

That’s in line with what Nissan has teased about the concept—that the Ariya will have a 300-mile battery range (driving cycle not disclosed) and a 0-60 mph time of under 5.0 seconds.

Nissan Ariya Concept

“It’s a high-performance crossover, because at the end of the day it’s super-fast,” he said. “Its center of mass is super-low, so the handling characteristics are extremely good.”

The Ariya will also mark the debut of Nissan’s new e-4orce twin-motor all-wheel drive system, which Nissan claims can help the whole vehicle stay flatter during acceleration, braking, and cornering without otherwise having to stiffen the ride the rest of the time—in other words, making it a much more pleasant place for passengers. Green Car Reports got a demo of the e-4orce system in Las Vegas, and it appears to be everything it’s billed to be.

Nissan Leaf e-4orce twin-motor demo car

“You’d be surprised the kind of cars we can beat on a G-test on snow,” Albaisa said about the system.

In shaping the Ariya’s exterior, aerodynamics were very important. “We really wanted to get to 300 miles, something where you’re going to need science of shape, not just batteries and motor efficiencies,” explained Albaisa. “So we intentionally made this bullet-like shape; but then we raised it and gave it an SUV quality we fell in love with this combination.”

Although plenty of details about the Ariya—some of the most important ones, like the battery technology—remain secrets, Albaisa was eager to point out that what we see in the Ariya is, mostly, what we will get—a compact crossover that’s about 181 inches long, 76 inches wide, and 64 inches tall, which lands between today’s Nissan Rogue and Rogue Sport but is wider and a few inches lower (or for another equivalent, slightly shorter than the Tesla Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach-E).

Nissan IMx concept, 2017 Tokyo Motor Show

“This one is incorporating all the realities, even though it’s a concept car,” he said. “It’s very real; it’s on the wheelbase and the width and the height, all of that.”

That’s mostly true inside, too, the executive hinted. The interior emphasizes seamlessness, simplicity, and Japanese craftmanship, and is intended to underscore the technology. There’s a flat floor allowed by the low battery pack and an extra amount of spaciousness afforded by moving climate-control components out of a center console and under the hood. Haptic touch controls essentially fade into the dash design when they’re not in use, and the 12.3-inch infotainment display and dash display are staggered on different planes, keeping the instrument displays out at what should be a more comfortable eye distance.

The Ariya is setting a new design direction for potentially as many as a half-dozen other Nissan EVs to follow in the next decade, globally, and be based on the same underpinnings. Albaisa said that the common thread among all of them is that they’ll be outfitted like flagships inside, but they’ll have an “adventurous spirit” on the outside.

Although Nissan has dodged questions about exact arrival timing for the production vehicle based on Ariya, we might have to wait a while yet. Reports (and reports of a dealer preview last year) peg it for going on sale in the second half of 2021.","According to Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan’s senior VP for global design, the Ariya will still be seen as an affordable big-brother crossover to the Leaf.

This technique seeks to identify those stocks whose prices are varying within a specific band. In case a stock falls below the lower bound of this band, it may be time to dump it from your portfolio. However, a stock breaking above this channel carries the promise of delivering strong gains.

Spotting Breakout Stocks

The first step to selecting the right breakout stock is to calculate their support and resistance levels. A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period.

In other words, demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level, which means most traders are willing to sell it. At the resistance level, most traders are willing to go long on the stock, which means that they would like to add them to their portfolio. The key to identifying breakout stocks is to pin down those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level.

Verifying Whether It’s for Real

Stocks that have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders. But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is whether they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support. This is why it is important to determine whether a long-term price trend is about to emerge.

Only a study of long-term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively. This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels. If you can identify the effective channel for a stock, picking it even at a not-so-reasonable price would give you significant returns.

Screening Parameters

• Percentage price change over four weeks between 10% and 20% (Stocks which are showing considerable price increases, but whose gains are not excessive.)

• Current Price /52-Week High greater than or equal to 0.9 (Stocks which are trading 90% close to their 52-week highs.)

No matter whether the market is good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

• Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2

(Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit.)

• Current price less than or equal to $20 (Stocks which are reasonably priced.)

15,https://www.electrive.com/2020/01/14/lightyear-wants-to-build-affordable-evs/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",www.electrive.com,Lightyear wants to build affordable EVs,"Lightyear, the Dutch start-up company that emerged from the solar team at the TU Eindhoven, is planning a more affordable version of its long-distance solar car Lightyear One, for which a price of €149,000 has been announced. The upcoming models are expected only to cost a third of the One.

Lightyear now announces that the company intends to concentrate fully on the development of its core technology and outsource production. The ambitious goal is the series production of more than 100,000 solar cars per year from 2023 onward at a sales price of about 50,000 euros. Initially, production of an exclusive set of 946 vehicles is planned for 2021. Lightyear does not mention, which company will produce the vehicles in the announcement.

The Lightyear One was introduced in June 2019. Among the special features of the five-meter sedan are not only the solar cells but also the focus on efficiency. The WLTP range is to be 725 kilometres, and the battery, which has not yet been described in detail, is to be as small and light as possible. Together with a light and aerodynamic body and four efficient engines, the standard consumption is to be just 8.3 kWh per 100 kilometres (83 Wh/km). However, the price of at least 149,000 Euro will ensure that the Lightyear One will remain an exclusive car.

For the planned other models (the company itself speaks in the plural) the price is expected to drop to the mentioned 50,000 Euro. Lightyear does not give more details about size, drive or even body shape in the announcement.

This year, Lightyear’s focus will be on “developing its core technologies”, as the company writes. The goal is to bring the One to (small) production maturity, “to secure Lightyear’s competitive advantage”.

In plans, Lightyear intends to continue to work according to its credo of “making a positive impact through technological innovation”. “We are convinced that this is the way to grow, make our full impact and take our responsibility: Clean mobility for everyone, everywhere,” says Lex Hoefsloot, Lightyear’s CEO with confidence.

Most recently, the founders of Sono Motors in Germany had to learn what it can mean to hold on to your ideals and convictions. The turning away from financial investors and the current crowdfunding campaign are the result. Lightyear, too, is currently in a round of investments to finance serial production. The Lightyear platform and the exclusive small series of the One will then serve as a basis for attracting the investments required for the 2023 scale-up.

The hatchback model of Toyota’s nifty Yaris subcompact car was discontinued for 2019, but an all-new 2020 version is now on the market. Like the 2020 Yaris sedan, the 2020 Yaris hatchback is based on Mazda’s current Mazda2, a car not available in the United States.

Toyota offers the new Yaris Hatchback in two trims: LE and XLE. They are both mono-spec, meaning they come with specific standard features and no optional equipment is available. But the standard features aren’t paltry.

Features of the LE grade include halogen headlights, fog lights, 16-inch wheels, fabric sport front bucket seats, 60/40 split fold-flat rear seats, remote keyless entry with push button start, a backup camera, six-speaker audio system with 7-inch touchscreen display, SiriusXM satellite radio, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, Bluetooth, an auxiliary port and two USB ports.

To the list of LE features, the XLE adds rain-sensing variable intermittent windshield wipers, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel with controls for audio, cruise, and phone. The XLE also has automatic climate control, LED headlights with auto on/off, and leatherette rather than fabric for the seats.

The interior of the 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback is tidy, artistic, and assembled with precision. (Manufacturer photo)

Both models are powered by a capable four-cylinder engine with 106 horsepower, paired with a fluent six-speed automatic transmission. The fuel economy rating is a splendid 32 mpg city, 40 mpg highway, and 35 mpg combined.

Base pricing with a $955 destination charge included is $18,705 for the LE, and $19,705 for the XLE.

The term “affordable subcompact” can sometimes be used to flatter an uncomfortable, flimsy car. The 2020 Yaris Hatchback is affordable and a subcompact, but uncomfortable and flimsy it is not.

The Mazda effect is apparent in the new Yaris Hatchback’s appealing exterior and interior design. Toyota says its cab-rearward design gives the 2020 Yaris Hatchback “a distinct hunkered-down, bulldog-like stance,” and as a dog lover I can’t top that description.

The interior is neat, tidy, and artistic, and has been assembled with precision. It’s also pretty quiet. Driver and front passenger are given enough space to keep from feeling cramped. Rear seat room is decent, but as expected in a subcompact, leg room is scarce. Cargo space, on the other hand, is impressive: 15.86 cubic feet.

The 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback is available in two mono-spec trim levels: LE and XLE. (Manufacturer photo)

The Mazda chassis gives the new Yaris Hatchback sportier handling, and there’s a Sport driving mode if you think even better response would be nice.

One of my favorite things about driving the Yaris Hatchback was how effortlessly I could maneuver through parking lots and whip into tight parking spaces. The car’s turning radius is only 32.2 feet. To put that into perspective: On a narrow street in downtown Everett with diagonal parking, I was able to turn into a space intended for cars coming in the opposite direction, and I didn’t even have to straighten the car out. It was perfectly in the space. It was thrilling. Probably illegal, but at least there were no cars coming when I did it.

In December, the car was seen, among others, by former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel (see video below from 0.47-0.50), who is a well-known home solar power supporter.

Our attention was caught by the most recent news about the plan of a next, higher volume, more affordable solar electric car, as the Lightyear One is limited to 946 copies and cost in Europe €149,000 (including VAT).

The more affordable Lightyear solar electric car is planned for 2023, with a price tag of around €50,000 ($55,500).

The company intends to focus on the technology and making its cars very efficient, while production as high as over 100,000 cars annually would be outsourced.

Well, it would be great to achieve such a level, but taking into consideration what we saw from other startups for over more than a decade, it sounds extremely optimistic.

""By scaling up its core technology Lightyear expects to be ready to start high volume production of more than 100,000 cars per year around 2023. The projected sales price can be as sharp as €50,000 ($55,500) on these future models. This ambitious goal is in line with Lightyear’s mission: it is a company founded to generate a positive impact through technology innovation.""

The fund will focus on projects in India’s top seven cities, Bahrain-based Investcorp said in a statement.

BAE Systems Pension Funds Investment Management Ltd, which manages the retirement corpus of the British defence and aerospace firm’s employees, has come in as a cornerstone investor for the platform.

Vikram Aggarwal, head of private markets at BAE Systems Pensions, said there is significant demand for affordable housing projects in India but there is also a lack of institutional capital to fund these projects.

Ritesh Vohra, partner and head of real estate at Investcorp India, said affordable housing has emerged as a dominant segment, augmented by government efforts and the introduction of favourable policies. The current slowdown in the residential markets and in the flow of credit in India create an opportune timing for the firm to launch this new lending initiative, he added.

Sanjay Kohli, a London-based principal at Investcorp, said global investors are looking at the Indian property sector with enthusiasm following policy reforms including the real estate regulatory act and easing of regulations for real estate investment trusts.

These reforms, Kohli said, are helping property markets in India get more transparent, prompting institutional investors to increase their exposure in the country.

Investcorp manages over $28 billion globally and is a mid-market specialist. The firm is an active investor in the US and European real estate markets, targeting properties that generate cash flow and have the potential for capital appreciation through value-add initiatives. Since its inception, the firm has invested in more than 765 properties with total commitment in excess of $18 billion.

Investcorp entered India’s alternative assets management segment last year by acquiring the private equity and real estate investment businesses of IDFC Alternatives Ltd, a subsidiary of IDFC Ltd.

In India, Investcorp’s real estate business has deployed over $200 million through two funds across 27 residential projects in top-tier cities. The funds provided structured senior credit to mid-market and affordable housing projects being developed by well-established developers. The firm also made PE-style bets on Zolo Stays, Citykart, Intergrow Brands, Bewakoof and Nephroplus in 2019.","Global alternative asset management firm Investcorp has raised $130 million (Rs 920 crore) in anchor commitments to provide last-mile lending for affordable and mid-market housing projects in India.

New York-based Blink Fitness recently acquired four former Fitness 2000 gyms in Tarrant County, with plans to further expand around DFW.

Blink describes itself as ""an inclusive, affordable gym that values mood above muscle."" True to that motto, ad campaigns feature real members with realistic bodies, not rail-thin models or elite athletes. And monthly memberships start at just $10.

The first four local Blink locations are:

“Opening our first four gyms in DFW is just the beginning of our presence here in the market, as well as our continued growth nationally,” says Todd Magazine, CEO of Blink Fitness, in a release. “A growing and diverse population brought us to DFW, where we will employ more than 100 people from the community. We are thrilled to be bringing our affordable, inclusive approach to health and wellness to communities throughout DFW.”

Each former Fitness 2000 gym was closed and renovated for several weeks before debuting as Blink. Members returned to a sparkling clean, spacious new layout; technology upgrades; and walls freshly painted in ""mood-lifting"" colors like green, blue, and orange, featuring motivational sayings like ""Strong arms make for better high fives.""

They now sell a variety of energy snacks and sports beverages, and call employees ""mood lifters.""

The gyms offer state-of-the-art equipment including cardio machines, strength equipment, dumbbells, and designated areas for stretching, HIIT, bodyweight training, and more. Certified personal trainers are available for one-on-one fitness coaching ($30), and every membership comes with a free personal training start-up session.

Memberships are available at three levels: Orange ($10 per month), for one location and an annual commitment; Gray ($15 per month), for one location and no commitment; and Blue (currently $18 per month), for all locations and an annual commitment. Only Blue-level members get access to a childcare option called Kid's Club for ages 6 months to 12 years, as well as group fitness classes and a free Blink App that delivers daily fitness and wellness content, including videos for at-home workouts.

All previous Fitness 2000 members are ""grandfathered"" in as Blue members.

For those who like to sweat it out with a group, Blink offers 22 instructor-led classes with variations of yoga, dance, interval training, and cardio (including Zumba, Body Combat, and Body Attack).

The gyms are open 24 hours Monday-Friday (opening at 5 am Monday and closing at 11:59 pm Friday); and 7 am-7 pm Saturday and Sunday.

According to the release, Blink has 140 locations open or in development throughout New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, California, Illinois, Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Texas. Blink, they add, has been ranked on the Inc. 5000 list three times, was recognized as one of the top health clubs by Club Industry, and selected as the best budget chain by Men's Health.","The new year brought a new fitness chain to the Fort Worth area — and along with the treadmills, Zumba classes, and personal training sessions, it's offering a modern message of body-positivity.

Moen

The humble shower is one of those parts of the home many people just don't think about that much. It's early, you jump under the water, do your business, get out, get on with the day. But the showerhead market is ripe for innovation, and Moen is making a run for the head of the pack with its latest Nebia showerhead, which notably has the backing of Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The first Nebia 1.0 showerhead came out in 2015. It was engineered to reduce water consumption by reducing the size of water droplets. That was when Cook, as well as several other big names from Silicon Valley, threw their support behind the eco-conscious project.

A Nebia 2.0 followed, and this new iteration is the third—and smallest, least expensive showerhead yet. What makes the Nebia by Moen showerhead such a novel innovation is that it is designed to give users twice the usual coverage you can expect from whatever's installed in your bath now, yet cut consumption by up to 45 percent.

It does this by using a patented method of atomizing water into very small drops yet not losing water pressure in the bargain. It doesn't affect the water's heat, either, but consumes more than 40 percent less energy.

But the price cut is the big deal here—the Nebia showerhead has been reduced from the 2.0 version's rather steep $499 to $199, and for $269 consumers also get an optional wand.

But if you jump on this deal now and back it through Kickstarter, you can buy the Nebia by Moen for $160. It comes in three finishes: matte black, nickel, and white + chrome, and including the wand only bumps it up to $199.

Article content Urgent investment from all three levels of government is needed to increase Ottawa’s supply of affordable housing, and to help homeless and disabled people find permanent homes that meet their needs, Mayor Jim Watson says. The memo, signed by Watson and Councillors Jenna Sudds and Catherine McKenney, was issued late Tuesday on the eve of a debate about whether to declare a city-wide emergency on affordable housing and homelessness. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Urgent investment needed to increase affordable housing supply: Ottawa mayor Back to video The memo reviews the city’s six year-old plan to address housing and homelessness and calls for a dramatic “refresh” of that strategy. In the next 10 years, it suggests, the city should create between 5,700 and 8,500 affordable housing units and financial subsidies, while also ensuring that 20 per cent of those are devoted to supportive and accessible housing. It also calls on the city to preserve its existing stock of Ottawa Community Housing units. The proposal sets out some ambitious goals: to reduce overall homelessness by 25 per cent and to eliminate “unsheltered” homelessness — people living on the streets.

Article content “The refreshed plan is aspirational in nature and requires the commitment of significant new funding from all levels of government in order to be realized,” the memo says. “Without an injection of increased, sustained and long-term funding, the plan will not achieve its ambitious outcomes.” The city will spend $109 million on housing and homelessness this year, which means the cost of the refreshed plan cannot be absorbed by municipal property taxpayers alone, Watson said. In the past two budgets, the city has committed $30 million in capital for new affordable housing developments. The province will contribute $43 million and the federal government $27 million to affordable housing and homelessness initiatives in Ottawa in 2020. Last month, McKenney put colleagues on notice that she will ask for their support to declare an emergency on affordable housing and homelessness. Council is to debate her motion Wednesday. The city’s housing crisis has been created by a welter of issues, according to a review of the city’s 2014 housing and homelessness plan. Funding for new affordable housing units has not kept pace with the city’s population growth that has forced Ottawa’s overall vacancy rate down to 1.8 per cent. That supply shortage has driven up prices: the average market rent in 2018 was $1,174 — a 15 per cent increase from 2014. That means more people in community housing are holding onto their units longer, reducing the annual turnover. The centralized wait list for community housing has more than 10,600 households on it. Families can wait years for a spot, and some are spending longer periods in emergency shelters.

Article content The lack of affordable housing has exacerbated the city’s homelessness problem. During the past six years, there has been a 23 per cent increase in the number of people requesting an emergency shelter placement. In 2018, the emergency shelter system operated, on average, at 108 per cent of its capacity. Family homelessness, the report said, is the main driver of the increased demand at the city’s emergency shelters, and the reason why Ottawa increasingly is relying on hotels and motels to house the overflow. More than 55,000 households in Ottawa — about 13 per cent of the population — live with the kind of low incomes that make housing a serious challenge. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation says Canadians should be spending no more than 30 per cent of their before-tax income on housing.

In the past two budgets, the city has committed $30 million in capital for new affordable housing developments.
The city’s housing crisis has been created by a welter of issues, according to a review of the city’s 2014 housing and homelessness plan.
That supply shortage has driven up prices: the average market rent in 2018 was $1,174 — a 15 per cent increase from 2014."

Growing up in the dusty streets of Harare's high-density suburb of Mufakose in the early '80s, most parents pressed children to get the highest points to enrol at the University of Zimbabwe.

Those who were ambitious would even push their children further to excel so that they could meet the requirements of Makerere University in Uganda.

Since 1920, when the British Secretary of State, Winston Churchill approved the establishment of a ""native technical school at Kampala"" Makerere University is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Africa.

It became a symbol of African civilisation, centre of knowledge and academic excellence.

For decades, Makerere University was regarded as the ""Harvard of Africa"", where thousands of students from African and even some European countries would study.

It was considered the foundation of knowledge that produced notables like Tanzanian presidents Julius Nyerere and Benjamin Mkapa, former president of the DRC, Laurent Desire Kabila and former Kenyan leader Mwai Kibaki.

In the same category was Fort Hare University of South Africa, which created an environment that inspired black consciousness and resistance against colonialism.

So, one could imagine what the yesteryear students had to put up with, at the behest of their parents, to acquire the best results.

As years passed, more universities were built in African countries to absorb the number of students who wanted to acquire university education.

Zimbabwe was not left out in the academic revolution, where the Government committed resources and expertise to construct more universities and technical colleges to absorb the growing number of students thirsty for university education.

Churches and the private sector ably assisted in the transformational phase by building universities to complement Government efforts to ensure university education was easily accessible.

Students no longer needed to travel far and beyond to acquire education unless there were other extenuating circumstances because universities were now readily available.

With Government grants, and subsidies, university education became easily accessible, and affordable, while offering quality education.

The country now boasts more than 10 universities, several technical colleges and vocational centres sprouted around Zimbabwe.

However, events of the last two months could reverse the country's efforts to ensure access to affordable university education.

Steep increases in fees and other ancillary costs came at a time Government had put a cap on university and college fees to ensure that tertiary education remains affordable.

A few weeks ago, the Government ordered State universities to set their full fees, including tuition and accommodation at $5 000 and below per semester, for both full-time conventional students and those on block release.

Polytechnics and teachers' colleges were directed to charge fees below $1 300 a semester for certificate and diploma programmes, while higher national diplomas and degrees will attract slightly higher fees.

The Government encouraged colleges to ensure they were charging a maximum of $1 200 a semester.

Naturally, most parents welcomed the move by Government to put a cap on university and college fees to make it affordable.

A week later, they were shocked to receive invoices, where accommodation and other ancillary costs for some degree programmes have been increased by more than 300 percent.

Students studying medicine at one local State university are being asked to pay $8 650, a fee structure which presumably caters for other ancillary costs such as lab fees.

Suffice to say, many parents say the fees are too steep and may drain their thinning pockets, which also have other competing interests to contend with, such as food, rentals and clothing.

In coming up with the cap, Government was trying to ensure that university education remains affordable and accessible in light of the dwindling disposable incomes particularly the majority of the formally employed whose salaries have not been adjusted.

With all things being equal, the decision by Government to cap fees, should create a balance between viability and affordability.

It is the desire of public universities and colleges in Zimbabwe to strengthen higher education systems locally and regionally by churning out top notch students.

That exercise requires the necessary tools such as skilled lecturers, infrastructure and proper teaching aids.

However, we believe that such a vision occasionally needs to be tuned with reality.

Reality on the ground shows that salaries for most workers have not been increased, hence the majority of them will not afford.

In light of that, universities and colleges should not regard the decision to cap the fees as averse, but as an interim solution to balance viability of institutions and affordable of university education.

It would be prudent for universities and colleges to justify the proposed fee hikes they had applied for, to enable Government to come up with a proper fee structure.

Already, accommodation for students remain a challenge at most institutions and yet some universities and colleges have been claiming that part of the students' fees go towards infrastructural development.

On the other hand, Government should not turn a blind eye to considerable difficulties that universities and colleges have been facing in recent years.

Top of the challenges that institutions of higher learning face are brain drain, inadequate infrastructure, the collapse of infrastructure and in some cases, lack of access to most basic tools needed to conduct high-level teaching and learning in the information age.

It is important to collectively consider the reality of attempting to not only remain committed to the core mission of institutions of higher learning under these difficult conditions, but also to other environmental constraints, and to demonstrating collective solidarity in such circumstances.

The nation hopes that those who cannot afford the increased fees should benefit from the $90 million grant set aside by the Government to benefit less-privileged students eager to acquire tertiary education.

With some banks requiring collateral security in form of a payslip, or proof of stable income from any business venture, students from underprivileged families are naturally disenfranchised and cannot access the money.

We hope the facility will not be abused by well-connected people and will assist disadvantaged students, giving relief to their struggling parents.

The Emefs Royal View Estate will include reasonable priced high class and middle class homes in addition to apartments, according to Mr Sitsofe Akpebu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company.

The company was among the exhibitors at the trade fair mounted alongside the just-ended 2020 Ghana Investment and Opportunities Summit held in London.

According to Mr Akpebu, the first phase of the project which involved the construction of two-bedroom expandable houses at customers' specifications was currently ongoing.

""This comes with a two-year payment plan in beautifully crafted houses which would cover 43 acres,"" he said.

The objective of the project, Mr Akpebu explained, was to build a model metropolitan community to contribute to industrialisation and national development.

Pursuant to that, he said, other sterling amenities, such as 24/7 secured gates for the housing units, a community police station and integrated home security systems would be provided at the estate to ensure the safety and comfort of residents.

There would also be water storage reservoirs, internet access, community playground, a gymnasium, schools and a club house and a shopping centre, Mr Akpebu added.

Mr Akpebu said that after executing that project in two years, Emefs Construction Limited would then embark on another housing project on 500 acres at Shai Hills.

He told the Ghanaian Times that some investors who visited Emefs Construction Limited's stand at the trade fair had expressed interest in the projects.

About 500 representatives of various business concerns from the UK, Ghana and the Ghanaian diaspora attended the two-day Ghana Investments and Opportunities Summit which ended at the London Hilton, Park Lane on Wednesday.

The event was under the theme: ""Accessing the African Common Market through Ghana - Technology, Digitisation and Industrialisation.""","London — Emefs Construction Limited has begun work on a 400 affordable housing unit's project at Gbetsile, along the Tema-Afienya road.

In Zimbabwe, nurses and doctors in government and local council-run health centres have been engaging in industrial action demanding salaries in foreign currency and improved working conditions.

This has seriously affected the country's fragile health delivery system with some public hospitals forced to close wards while patients left with no option but to visit private doctors who charge their services in foreign currency.

Investigations carried out by NewZimbabwe.com this week showed that cash-strapped Zimbabweans in need of urgent treatment, have resorted to crossing into Zambia to access cheaper and better health care.

Charles Gwindiri said his wife fell ill and he took her to Karoi hospital where they were turned away.

He decided to try a private hospital, which demanded US$300 upfront from the couple before they decided to travel to Zambia.

""Just a few days before Christmas, I took my wife to Mutendere Hospital in Zambia. She had problems with her legs and uterus,"" said Gwindiri.

""For her treatment and transport for the two of us, we used US$40, which is equivalent to 520 Kwacha. This amount is very little compared to the US$300, which we had been quoted by a local private hospital.""

In Zambia, Gwindiri said he met several Zimbabweans who were seeking medical assistance at the hospital.

Cleopas Moyo, 69, of Bulawayo also recently travelled to Livingstone in Zambia seeking treatment after he suffered a heart attack.

""I was forced to travel to Livingstone Central Hospital in Zambia because the money which was being charged by private doctors in Bulawayo was too exorbitant. I went to Mpilo Hospital thrice and I was told that there were no doctors,"" said Moyo.

For his transport, drugs and treatment in Zambia, Moyo said he used US$30.

""I boarded a train from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls and travelled to Livingstone by road. Had I not travelled to Zambia, I would be dead by now,"" said Moyo before urging the government to prioritise the health sector.

""Something has to be done by the government to bring life back to our health delivery system which has collapsed to unprecedented levels,"" he added.

To celebrate, we asked members of the profession how engineers can contribute to each of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

We asked Steve Posselt, Chair of Engineers Australia’s Sustainable Engineering Society, about which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals means the most to him and how engineers drive change in this space.

Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. According to the United Nations, 13 per cent of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity, and nearly 3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating.

Using combustible fuels for household energy can create indoor air pollution, which caused 4.3 million deaths in 2012, with women and girls accounting for six out of every 10 of these.

Our demand for energy is also the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

However, progress is being made towards more sustainable and cleaner sources of energy. The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5 per cent in 2015.

Posselt said SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy holds the greatest significance for him.

“I’ve been saying for 10 years that if you want to contribute to climate change action, buy green energy. And, once you’ve bought your green energy, the next best thing you can do is get your family to buy green energy. Once they have bought it, get your boss to buy green energy,” he said.

Posselt, who is based in New South Wales (NSW), was part of the leadership for the World Engineering Conference meeting on climate change in November last year.

“I’ve been saying for a very long time that the answer to all our woes is going to be found in engineering,” he said.

“But we need policymakers to say to engineers, ‘fix it’.”

Posselt added that it’s “fantastic” that there is now an international day for engineering.

“Because I don’t think the profession gets the attention it deserves,” he said.

“Just about everything you see has the fingerprint of an engineer on it. The buildings in a city, even the trees in the street have been through a process of deciding where you’re going to plant them and how you’re going to get water to them. Engineers have had something to do with it all.”

""In addition to accelerating the increased price of electricity to all consumers, this plan will require additional costs through the necessary retrofitting of each home and business to accommodate an electric-only infrastructure.""

Research from a McLaughlin & Associates survey shows that while New Jersey residents care strongly about climate change, they also disapprove of many of the key elements of the EMP.

Although the SPHS technology was established previously, it has not been used often.

The study was reported in the Nature Communications journal, and shows that when compared to other fully developed storage solutions, like natural gas, there is substantial potential for SPHS to offer highly competitive energy storage costs. This could fill a desperately needed gap to promote the switch to renewable energy.

“The energy sectors of most countries are undergoing a transition to renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar generation,” says Julian Hunt, an IIASA postdoc and the lead author of the study.

These sources are intermittent and have seasonal variations, so they need storage alternatives to guarantee that the demand can be met at any time. Short-term energy storage solutions with batteries are underway to resolve intermittency issues, however, the alternative for long-term energy storage that is usually considered to resolve seasonal variations in electricity generation is hydrogen, which is not yet economically competitive. Julian Hunt, Study Lead Author and Postdoc, IIASA

SPHS involves pumping water into a deep storage reservoir, constructed parallel to a major river, when there is high water flow or low demand for energy. During water scarcity or an increase in energy demand, the stored water is released from the reservoir to produce electricity.

This study is the first to offer a universal, high-resolution analysis of the costs and prospects for SPHS technology. As part of the analysis, the researchers evaluated the theoretical worldwide potential to store water and energy seasonally with SPHS, with a focus on locations with the lowest cost and highest potential.

In addition, the researchers analyzed various scenarios in which the storage of water and energy with SPHS could be a feasible alternative. The study involved topographical, hydrology, and river network data, estimation of infrastructure cost, and optimization of project design, to determine technically viable candidate locations.

The research reveals that the cost of water storage using SPHS plants range from 0.007 to 0.2 US$/m3, costs for long-term storage of energy range from 1.8 to 50 US$/MWh, and costs for short-term storage of energy range from 370 to 600 US$/KW of installed power generation capacity, taking tunnel, dam, generator, turbine, land, and excavation costs into account.

The estimated global energy storage potential is below a cost of 50 $/MWh is 17.3 PWh. This value is roughly 79% of the global electricity consumption in 2017.

The team discovered that there is considerable potential for SPHS across the globe, specifically in the lower part of the Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, Alps, Andes, northern part of the Middle East, Brazilian Highlands, Ethiopian Highlands, East Asia, Central America, Papua New Guinea, the Sayan, Yablonoi and Stanovoy mountain ranges in Russia, and various other locations with smaller potential.

Concerns about the intermittency and seasonality of wind and solar can be valid, but are also sometimes exaggerated. This study demonstrates that there is an extremely high potential for SPHS to be used across much of the world, providing a readily-available, affordable, and sustainable solution to support the transition to sustainable energy systems and overcome real and perceived barriers to high shares of renewable generation. Edward Byers, Study Coauthor and Researcher, IIASA

The research also deals with certain possible environmental concerns associated with hydropower. SPHS reservoirs are deep and built parallel to, and not within the course of a river; therefore, the land use and environmental effects can also be nearly 10 to 50 times less than conventional hydropower plants.

With the need for a transition to a more sustainable world with lower CO 2 emissions, renewable energies and energy storage will play a major role in the near future. Given the vast untapped and cheap potential of SPHS, it will soon play an important role in storing energy and water on a yearly basis. Julian Hunt, Study Lead Author and Postdoc, IIASA

29,https://grist.org/politics/why-are-climate-conscious-cities-often-the-least-affordable/,"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Grist,Why are climate-conscious cities often the least affordable?,"Cities can do a lot to stop climate change. They can fill their streets with electric buses, pass strict efficiency rules for its buildings, and switch to powering the place with clean energy.

But there’s a problem that mayors rarely mention when touting their green cred. The cities striving to go green tend to be the priciest, pushing all but the affluent into carbon-spewing commutes. Think New York, London, and, of course, San Francisco.

Most of San Francisco’s electricity comes from a nuclear plant, solar panels, and other forms of clean energy, meaning that eighty-five percent of the energy powering the city’s network of electric buses and trains is carbon- free. It recently barred people from driving on the main drag, Market Street, allowing bicycles and transit to flow freely. The city pays residents to put solar panels on their homes. But boy do you have to pay to get into this garden of delights: $1.2 million for the median home. As a result, the area has seen a 170 percent increase in the number of people commuting more than an hour and a half since 2005. All that driving has California’s climate efforts stuck in traffic. To meet its climate goals, most experts say the state will need to build a lot more apartments near bus and train stops.

It’s not just California or even the United States. As cities around the world expand to house some 2 billion new people by the end of the century, they’ll have to decide: Will they grow up, grow out, or try to stop growing entirely and turn away immigrants?

California’s coastal cities were true innovators in strategies to push people elsewhere. In his new book, Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America, Connor Dougherty, an economics reporter at The New York Times who was raised in the Bay Area, puts the state’s housing history under the microscope. Grist asked Dougherty how well-meaning environmentalists helped drive up housing costs, and what will reverse that trend.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Q.First of all, what’s behind the housing crisis in California?

A.Put simply, we do not have enough housing. And it costs too much to build the housing needed. California has the highest home prices in the country. We have some of the worst rents in the country. We have half the homeless population in the country, even though we have just one-twelfth the population. So, while this is a national problem, California has been exceptionally bad at dealing with it.

Q.Are homeless people moving to California or is the homeless problem simply related to the lack of homes?

A.It’s absolutely related to a lack of homes. A lot of people want to say it’s mental health or drug addiction, and obviously those things are related. But lots of people around the country struggle with drugs and mental health without ending up on the streets. So what’s the variable that matters? It’s the cost of housing.

Q.Do environmentalists share some blame for driving up housing prices?

A.So in the 1960s and ‘70s there was a transition around the first Earth Day where we saw the rise of suburban environmentalism. Some of that was really good: The environmental justice movement has been amazing, and suburban environmentalism was a mass movement. Older conservationism was generally exclusive because only a certain type of person could go spend a bunch of time in nature. It wasn’t a bad movement — I don’t think we’d be better off without Yosemite National Park — it just wasn’t something moving majorities at the local level. Because it was pretty inextricably tied to home values, as well as a general love of your neighborhood, environmentalism could move majorities.

Q.So that suburban environmentalism worked because people could see benefits in their own neighborhoods. They were also pushing for less housing nearby so there would be more room for birds.

A.Totally. I think that if somebody could know definitely that allowing higher density housing in their neighborhood would affect the arc of climate change they would make that sacrifice. But it’s hard to see and hard to know.

Q.The green backlash against growth is also important. How did that emerge?

A.There was a postwar suburban boom and California, really Los Angeles, was the most exaggerated example of that. In the early days people were pretty apolitical; that is, the newcomers were not anti-newcomer. That started to change in the ’70s. A bunch of books were published about how California was being ruined. One of those books was The Destruction of California by Raymond Dasmann. He was an environmentalist, and he was very concerned about growth — as he should have been. They were trying to build freeways everywhere.

Today, saying we do not want to keep growing at this scale and that we do not want to keep chewing up land and creating more space for cars is not something anyone would disagree with. But there are also aspects of that movement we can question.

Dasmann basically posits that, if we don’t plan for population growth, it won’t happen. If we don’t make California hospitable to people they will not come. Presciently, he says, the only place I’ve seen this done successfully is wealthy cities like Santa Barbara. I read that and thought, “Wow!” That, ideology taken to its logical extreme means that all of California becomes Santa Barbara, where only the wealthy can afford a house.

Q.And it’s not just greens. A big part of the housing crisis comes from people wanting to keep their neighborhoods white and affluent. How does that translate into restricting homes?

A.All around the country there are rules to make lot sizes large, or prohibit multifamily buildings, which have the net effect of making housing more expensive. Though these rules were often explicitly racist when they were passed, I don’t think they are as explicitly race motivated as they once were. But the net effect is the same, because of wealth inequality. I’m sure there are wonderful people who want to live in a diverse, multicultural suburb that is just generally wealthy and has all the same housing type.

Q.You write that one way to keep poor people out of a neighborhood is to incorporate as a city. Californian cities, starting with Lakewood in Los Angeles County, figured out how to do this by creating something called a contract city. What’s that?

A.A contract city is a technology. It makes something expensive and time consuming simpler and easier — that is what technology does. In a contract city, instead of hiring departments they contract out city services — often to the county. If you go to Lafayette, California today there are Lafayette police cars, but they are not really police, they are county sheriffs that are contracted to pretend that they are Lafayette police. If you wanted to build a city and actually pay for a police department and a waste treatment plant you’d have to pay a lot of money for them.

So this innovation makes it cheaper for an area to gain the land-use power of a city to make housing more expensive. Rules like large-lot zoning ordinances that require people to buy three acres with their house have the effect of excluding poorer people who require more services.

Q.How do we fix this?

A.It’s pretty simple, right? You can either make housing affordable by subsidizing it, or you can build more housing. You can do both and hopefully they work together. Step one in a solution is that we are talking about the problem. People are sick of living like this; they’ve accepted that the status quo is totally unacceptable. There are young people both on the tenant side [we should subsidize housing] and the YIMBY [“yes in my backyard” — let’s build more] side choosing to spend their Wednesday evenings going to planning meetings. This alone is a huge amount of progress.","The cities striving to go green tend to be the priciest, pushing all but the affluent into carbon-spewing commutes.

Then agan, maybe not.

By living in cities we often have to choose between livability, sustainability and affordability. However, that is not the case in the new project presented by the SPACE10 Research and Design Lab, EFFEKT Architects and IKEA, which promises to unite the three under one roof.

Building on years of research, the project tackles a simple question: how can human communities thrive in the 21st century while respecting nature and using the benefits of modern technology? The Urban Village Project sets out to explore this idea, providing visionary descriptions and rich 3D visuals for imagining those possibilities.

The premise is to find partners that are willing to explore such opportunities in real life. The creators believe that “living a sustainable life shouldn’t feel like a burden, but like a natural part of life.” And they want to achieve this by “rethinking the design, management and life cycle of our built environment.”

At the core of this vision is living in small neighborhoods supplied with 12 shared services and facilities, which fit “people of all ages, backgrounds, and living situations”. These include a shared living room and kitchen, co-working and event spaces, as well as fitness and playscape areas.

Every such neighborhood would also have sensory gardens for recreation, retail, health clinics, and farms. Ebike stations and maker spaces are also considered to be a must.

Among key sustainable solutions, the project relies on renewable energy, water harvesting, tool-lending libraries, local food production and the composting of food leftovers, as well as digital apps that grant access to community services. The neighborhoods would also rely on circular design principles, with all of the buildings and items being easy to disassemble, repair, replace and recycle.

In terms of actual living, the idea is to offer flexible housing fit for particular needs. Apartment options range from 36sqm for single people to 144sqm for families with three children. The buildings would be made from cross-laminated sustainable timber, which the founders consider a much better fit for human health and the planet than buildings made from steel frames filled with concrete.

To make all of this affordable, the project will use a prefabricated modular building system that would be mass-produced and funded by investors that don’t seek short-term profits, like pension funds, sustainable businesses, and municipalities. Project founders would further seek to transition those properties to community ownership with each person or family taking financial ownership at the scale and pace they can afford.

Even with a wealth of futuristic sustainable developments hitting the market in recent years, this new project seems to stand out by focusing on things that matter. It balances between shiny eco-luxury and utopian ecovillage ideas and provides a decent response to the global urbanization challenge.

Hopefully, we can soon see this visionary project taking off the ground in real life.","By living in cities we often have to choose between livability, sustainability and affordability.

The Maine State Housing Authority (MaineHousing) will be tasked with administering and allocating $80 million of credits to affordable rental housing developers between 2021 and 2028, with up to $10 million allocated each year. Any unused allocation can be carried forward to later years.

The Governor’s State of the State address touted the credit as aiming to create nearly 1,000 additional affordable housing units over eight years and increasing Maine’s current rate of production by 50%.

The AHTC is modeled on Maine’s existing historic preservation tax credit as well as certain aspects of the federal low income housing tax credit. Like the historic preservation credit, the AHTC is available for both income and insurance premiums taxpayers, and importantly, is fully refundable, meaning an investor need not have Maine tax liability in order to benefit from the credit. Furthermore, the credit can be allocated among partners or co-owners of an affordable housing project.

Eighty percent of the credits are available for “qualified Maine projects,” which means new construction or rehab of existing buildings that have not been used for residential purposes, that are subject to a restrictive covenant requiring 60% of the units to be rented to tenants with household income at or below 50% of area median gross income, and that are eligible for the 30% present value federal credit because they utilize tax-exempt financing.

Like the federal credit, the amount of the AHTC is tied to project costs. At a very high level, (1) for affordable housing projects funded by tax-exempt bonds, the Maine AHTC equals the federal low-income housing tax credit; and (2) for other projects, the AHTC is 50% of qualified basis, up to $500,000 for a single affordable housing project. No more than 20% of the credits can be used for projects that do not utilize tax-exempt financing.

An affordable housing project must maintain a level of qualification for 45 years from the date the project is placed in service. A project that does not restrict 60% of its units to households with incomes at or below 50% of the area median gross income, or qualify as a qualified rural development preservation project, for 15 years after being placed in service must repay a portion of the AHTC.

Ten percent of the AHTC allocation in any year is set aside for rural development preservation projects. In addition, MaineHousing must target at least 30% of the AHTC to be allocated to senior housing and 20% of the AHTC to be allocated to housing in rural areas.","1645 , establishing a Maine affordable housing tax credit (AHTC).

Like most students, Emily Jenkins had to choose between the best college for her and the best price.

Eight years ago, she chose the best college. Now, she’s paying the price.

Even with a combination of merit scholarships and lots of help from her parents, Jenkins walked away with a psychology degree from Wheelock College, a private school in Boston, with $30,000 in loans.

Like many people her age, she likes both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for lots of reasons. But it’s their bold plans to offer free college that intrigued her most.

“I like that what they are talking about isn’t just making the current debt go away, but how can we prevent other kids from getting this debt,” said Jenkins, who graduated from Bow High School in 2012. “They are getting debt that is way worse – six figures of debt to get a degree so that they can do what they want for a career.”

She thinks the government should do more to control college costs and help students pay for tuition. Even better, make it free, she said.

“I think education should be mostly government-funded,” she said. “We offer through grade 12, but I think we should offer at the very least a few years after that, so you can get through general education requirements.”

As college costs have soared, so has student debt, making it one of the most significant financial issues for Millenials and their Gen X parents.

Recognizing the issue and a captive audience, all of the Democratic candidates support some form of free college, but there is substantial variation in scope, according to a study released Wednesday by the Carsey School of Public Policy. Similarly, most candidates promise relief on existing loans, but some provide greater assistance to students with the largest debts regardless of their income, while others want to target assistance to lower-income earners and those in public service.

The diversity of approaches between the candidates is striking, the Carsey School found.

The average student loan debt for members of the Class of 2018 is $29,200, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. And federal student debt now totals $1.5 trillion, its highest level ever. It is now the second leading consumer debt category, behind only mortgage debt.

‘Shadow that hangs over you’

These days, Jenkins is working in Manchester at Manchester Child Development Center as an infant teacher. Jenkins said it’s a job she loves – and she doesn’t want her loans to impact her ability to stay there long-term.

“At the time I didn’t really care about the money or the loans, because I just wanted the best education,” she said, of when she started the college search in high school. “Now, I don’t have as many loans as some of my peers do, but I am paying literally for choosing that expensive education now. It’s a shadow that hangs over you and your future.”

The issue of college affordability is particularly acute in New Hampshire, which has some of the highest in-state tuition costs in the country and graduates are saddled with the most debt.

The Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire is hosting an event Thursday from 3:30-7:30 p.m. in Huddleston Hall Ballroom to explore the topic of college affordability as well as look at how the issue is playing out on the campaign trail.

Speakers include presidential candidates of both parties, U.S. legislators, and political and college affordability experts. All presidential candidates from both parties were invited to speak.

College cost is an ever-present issue for young people who’ve been crippled by debt from a system that was not created to give them the support they need.

Maggie Phillips, of Pembroke, works three jobs, 20 hours a week, and is a full-time student at Keene State College.

Phillips, 19, is a sophomore studying political science and has already accrued $25,000 in debt. She went to NHTI for her first semester of school to save more costs.

Phillips and her parents estimated she would graduate with about $50,000 in debt, but even that was low.

“Around $57,000 – even just saying that number that feels like a death sentence,” she said. “I have no concept of that at all.”

Phillips said the candidate that stood out to her on the campaign trail has been Sanders, who has promised to eliminate tuition at public schools as well as private historically black and other minority-serving colleges. Sanders would write off $1.6 trillion in student loans. Sanders would also triple the number of work-study jobs.

“From the get-go, I have known he’s my candidate. We bailed out the banks after the recession and we need to do the same for people with student debt,” she said. “There are people in their 30s, 40s and 50s who are still paying their student debts. I signed up to get an education not to live in poverty for 30 or 40 years.”

State funding for public colleges and universities has declined for years, leading to soaring costs. At the same, federal student assistance has decreased. The combination made student debt nearly triple in a decade.

“In the distant past, students might have reasonably expected to pay their tuition and living expenses with the earnings from a part-time or summer job. But for decades now, college costs have risen inexorably, and increasing costs without equal increases in grant aid have resulted in pervasive affordability challenges and rising student debt,” the Carsey study said.

States often make deep cuts in higher education during economic downturns, but they tend not to replace the funds when times are good. The trend accelerated during the Great Recession when almost all states made deep cuts, but those cuts were particularly sharp in the Granite State, which gives the lowest amount of college aid per person of all the states, according to the Carsey study.

Candidate’s plans

All of the Democratic candidates support some form of free college, the Carsey study found. Former mayor Pete Buttigieg hopes to eliminate tuition at all public colleges and universities for students with family incomes under $100,000. He also wants to offer at least some subsidies for students with families earning under $125,000. Warren would make all public colleges and universities tuition-free.

Sen. Michael Bennet, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Gov. Deval Patrick and Tom Steyer would provide money to states to eliminate tuition at community colleges. These programs would be funded in part by the federal government, and in part by each state, according to the Carsey analysis.

Andrew Yang would make community college “tuition-free or nearly free,” funded by the government and businesses, according to the Carsey study. Among Republicans, Gov. Bill Weld would offer two free years at a community college or a university.

Nearly all of the Democratic candidates would also increase spending on Pell Grants, a program that assists low-income students in paying for college costs. Biden and Klobuchar would double the size of Pell Grants – now about $6,200. Klobuchar would also expand eligibility for Pell Grants to families earning up to $100,000. Buttigieg and Warren would invest smaller amounts to increase Pell grants by about $1,000 per student, the Carsey study found.

Bennet supports expanding Pell Grants to technical training, according to the study. President Trump would extend Pell Grants to programs that are shorter than the traditional academic semester.

Bennet, Biden, and Weld wish to offer additional loan forgiveness to those in public service jobs. Steyer would improve the implementation of the public service loan forgiveness promised by current law. Sen. Klobuchar would forgive loans for those in in-demand occupations, according to the Carsey study.

U.S. Rep Tulsi Gabbard and Yang would allow loans to be forgiven in cases of bankruptcy. President Trump is also considering this step, the Carsey study noted, citing the Wall Street Journal.

Buttigieg and Patrick would cancel debt for those who attended low-quality for-profit colleges and offer reductions to students who do not graduate, according to the Carsey report.

‘A ton of money’

Matthew Gerding said he was eyeing opportunities out of state before he graduated from Concord High. He liked McGill in Canada or the University of Rochester in New York but he chose UNH because it was the best financial option for him.

Gerding’s father worked at Plymouth State as a locksmith and he was able to receive reduced tuition, along with scholarships and grants. He worked full-time in college between a job at the dining halls all four years and a job in the university’s research labs.

“I felt like I was making the best decision I possibly could and I still walked away with a bunch of money I owed,” said Gerding, now a sixth-grade science and math teacher at Somersworth Middle School.

He ended by with $20,000 in student loans after graduating with a microbiology degree in 2012.

“That’s a ton of money – that’s a car – but compared to so many people with debt that’s nothing,” he said.

Now, he’s back at UNH while teaching full time getting his master’s in education public policy.

His job helps pay his tuition and he applied for a federal benefit for teachers in math and science, which could contribute up to $17,500.

Gerding said he likes Warren’s plan best. In addition to free tuition at public universities and colleges, Warren has proposed forgiving the first $50,000 in debt, based upon income, and promised to do so on day one of her presidency.

“She’s trying to take a big chunk out of the pockets of people and saying, ‘I don’t want people to have as much debt – I want people to worry about other things, like their career or family and not have to worry about paying for college,” he said.

“Shes been reasonable,” he added. “I think Bernie’s is a little too sweeping.”

Mackenzie Murphy, 22, got her associate’s degree at Nashua Community College and transferred to Granite State College, where she studied psychology and business management online and was able to work at the community college in the admissions and financial aid office.

She did a year of AmeriCorps and received $5,500 to put toward college. She is currently enrolled in a master’s program at SNHU and she’s paying for two classes every 10 weeks to avoid loans.

Murphy said she liked Sanders’s plan best because it will expand federal Pell grants, make public colleges and universities tuition-free and increase work-study opportunities.

“Working in the admissions office, when you see those students who come into the office and they want to come to college but don’t have support from their parents, or can’t afford it, it’s not fair and it takes away so many opportunities from them,” she said. “Bernie’s plan would change that.”

Researchers are working on two solutions for electric vehicles (EVs), including a technology that would allow sharing of stored battery power with another EV and even sell excess energy to make a fast buck, for making the clean vehicles more economical.

Along with the power-sharing tool vehicle-to-everything (V2X), researchers are also examining the feasibility of battery swapping stations where an EV owner would simply replace the batteries like refilling of gas cylinders, Hitesh Datt Mathur, Associate Professor at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, has said.

The two solutions can make EVs economical as customers would not need to buy expensive heavy batteries which account for around 25-30 percent of the total cost of an EV currently.

The research projects are sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Mathur, who has designed an EV with V2X technology, said the model is capable of sharing stored power with another EV, a grid, hotels, malls, etc.

“The incentive could be seen by an example where a customer is charging EV with V2X feature at home at Rs 8 per unit and discharging some part of stored power at any commercial place at Rs 15 as commercial rates are higher than domestic rates of electricity,” he suggested.

When the EV is not in use, some parts of stored energy may be sold to others including the grid, another EV customer, even some offices or homes.

If a customer sells 20 units equivalent of power during this discharge, he will have Rs 140 earned. The power grid, at large, during peak hour, can also be supplemented by orderly managed owners of EVs with the V2X feature.

“One can imagine a parking lot of a mall where hundreds of V2X electric vehicles are parked for more than 6-7 hours in a day which is equivalent to a mid-sized power plant of 5 to 10-megawatt range since each electric car has a battery power of 20-25 kilowatts. Even if 30-40 percent of customers decide to sell power to the grid, it would be good enough for that mall itself. All this would be executed through a mobile app,” he said.

“The project will develop a cyber-physical network using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms,” Mathur said.

However, the project faces some challenges, he said. The associated infrastructure at various commercial and non-commercial places to enable V2X EVs is a great challenge.

Developing battery swapping stations (BSS) is another aspect of the project as it would make EVs with V2X feature affordable because one does not have to buy a battery of EV that costs approximately 25-30 percent of the total cost of the vehicle, Mathur said.

“This would just be like the refilling of gas cylinders we use. The opening of BSS has a huge commercial opportunity and many private players can be given the option to open a BSS (similar to petrol pumps),” he added. BSS may also have its own renewable power generation sources like solar, wind, etc.","Researchers are working on a technology for sharing of battery power with other EVs and selling excess energy to the grid to make EVs more economicalResearchers are working on two solutions for electric vehicles (EVs), including a technology that would allow sharing of stored battery power with another EV and even sell excess energy to make a fast buck, for making the clean vehicles more economical.

The homes are big enough for families of up to nine – 171 residents in total – and provide the borough with a type of housing which is in desperately short supply.

They will be owned by the council and managed by a housing association. Each home will be let at affordable rent – between 60% and 80% of market rent.

The proposal follows the launch of the council’s ‘Creating a Better Place’ boroughwide regeneration strategy which will see £306 million invested to transform Oldham, including creating more than 2,000 new homes in the town centre, 1,000 new jobs and 100 apprenticeship opportunities.

Cllr Hannah Roberts, cabinet member for housing, said: “Oldham Council is committed to ensuring more modern, right-sized, affordable homes are delivered across the borough.

“There are currently 2,689 households on the council’s waiting list who need four bedrooms or more. We only have 213 affordable/social rented properties of this size across the borough – and during the first six months of 2019, only five of these became vacant.

“The numbers speak for themselves and we are delighted to be stepping in to make sure 19 families will have a home that meets their needs, both now and in the future.”

The homes, on Ashton Road and Lee Street, Primrose Bank, are currently being built, with seven homes due to be completed in August 2020 and the final 12 in September.

Each property will feature state-of-the-art renewable energy equipment including photovoltaic solar panels and modern electrical heating, which will reduce carbon emissions and each property’s reliance on the National Grid.

The smart technology is being fitted as part of a project called RED WoLF (Rethink Electricity Distribution Without Load Following) – an Interreg North-West Europe programme funded by the EU, which Oldham Council is a key partner in.

It will combine solar PV renewable energy generation with battery storage and modern storage heaters. This will allow these homes to use renewable energy within the property, as well as to store grid electricity when nobody wants it. Negotiations with utilities will be aimed at achieving a reduced tariff for this service.

Cllr Abdul Jabbar, cabinet member for low carbon, said: “This is a really exciting scheme which will provide substantial financial benefits for residents, with most of their home’s energy generated by the renewable solar pv panels. At the same time, the equipment will create clean energy – resulting in a considerable reduction in carbon emissions.

“We’re proud to be one of only six pilot schemes in the UK, Ireland and France. The project is another important step in the council’s ambitions to becoming carbon neutral as an organisation by 2025 and to leading the borough to carbon neutrality by 2030.”

The council will buy the homes from Engie Regeneration, using Housing Revenue Account funds, as well as Section 106 contributions.

The proposal, which has been recommended for approval, will be discussed by councillors at the next cabinet meeting on Monday 24 February.","Oldham Council is set to approve plans to buy 19 new-build five-bedroom homes at Primrose Bank – providing much-needed new affordable housing in the borough.

The tool is hosted on Zillow’s website and allows landlords with affordable units and caseworkers seeking housing for their clients to connect in one place.

Local non-profit Housing Connector and other homeless service providers can browse availability across locations, rather than the traditional process of searching property-by-property. Landlords that use Housing Connector have relaxed criteria that can make it difficult for people to secure housing, like a history of evictions or criminal offenses.

There are 35 landlords and 42 nonprofits using the platform as of Wednesday, with additional partners expected to join, Zillow said.

Housing Connector is the main nonprofit utilizing Zillow’s new tool. The organization launched last year to help private property owners rent homes to people exiting homelessness. The Zillow tool launching today provides the technology to facilitate those connections more efficiently. Housing Connector mitigates risks for landlords who agree to rent to their clients, including sometimes covering move-in fees and other costs.

The tool is not public-facing, so individuals searching for housing won’t find it on Zillow’s website. But landlords and caseworkers who sign up for the program are able to access it on behalf of clients.

Zillow says its hopeful other communities could find a use for the affordability tool but the company doesn’t have plans to scale beyond the Seattle region at this time.

The tool was born out of Durkan’s Innovation Advisory Council, a coalition of technologists and government officials tasked with solving city problems using technology.","Zillow Group launched a new tool Thursday to help people experiencing homelessness in Seattle connect with affordable housing options.
The tool is hosted on Zillow’s website and allows landlords with affordable units and caseworkers seeking housing for their clients to connect in one place.
Local non-profit Housing Connector and other homeless service providers can browse availability across locations, rather than the traditional process of searching property-by-property.
Landlords that use Housing Connector have relaxed criteria that can make it difficult for people to secure housing, like a history of evictions or criminal offenses.
Housing Connector mitigates risks for landlords who agree to rent to their clients, including sometimes covering move-in fees and other costs."

Secured against the income stream of a UK-wide portfolio of high quality operational affordable housing, this represents its first deal to generate attractive matching-adjustment, compliant direct investments from affordable housing for its growing annuity portfolio. A further GBP175 million of development finance is being provided by a consortium of external investors to support the delivery of its current pipeline of 3,500 homes.



Legal & General is uniquely placed to invest annuity money into the UK economy, supporting its long-term pension commitments and creating real assets which provide new jobs, housing, productivity and wage growth. Affordable housing is an appropriate asset for Legal & General’s Pension Risk Transfer business, offering a secure portfolio of inflation-linked rental income which delivers long-term, diversified, stable returns. This latest investment demonstrates how Legal & General’s varied capital streams can be put to work in order to tackle the UK’s housing crisis and deliver extraordinary social outcomes.



The UK continues to suffer a growing crisis as 1.3 million households remain on waiting lists for social housing. One in three low income earners have had to borrow money to pay their rent and the steep decline in social housing has led to huge increases in government welfare costs, as well as rising homelessness. Legal & General is leading the evolution of the affordable housing sector; committed to raising service standards and deploying long-term institutional capital into a sector which continues to suffer from chronic undersupply.



Across its growing portfolio, Legal & General’s Affordable Housing business is delivering a mix of social rent, affordable rent and shared ownership homes. Established in 2018 and delivering its first homes in 2019, it is on target to create 3,000 homes each year by 2023 working in partnership with 14 established housing associations and providers.



Nigel Wilson, CEO of Legal & General, says: “Legal & General’s continued activity in the affordable housing sector demonstrates our unique ability to create real assets which match our long term pension liabilities, recycling the UK’s hard earned savings and pensions to support those most in need in society. We have already directly invested over GBP22 billion into new homes, urban regeneration, clean energy and transport infrastructure. Bringing in pension fund capital gives us the scope to do even more. This is inclusive capitalism at its best.”



Simon Century, Head of Affordable Housing at Legal & General, adds: “There is an urgent need to provide stable homes for millions of households on waiting lists. Legal & General is increasingly innovating with how to deploy institutional capital at scale to meet these needs and have a significant long term socio-economic impact. We have made a great start in executing our development programme, which now stands at nearly 3,500 homes all across the country. This investment from Legal & General Retirement will help us further bolster this pipeline.”

The program aims to converge automotive mass production techniques with the reliability of commercial-grade aerospace. The path to delivering low-cost aircraft systems starts with engineering services, then parts fabrication, and finally system integration supporting the launch of ASX’s all-electric eVTOL aircraft, the MOBi-One.





MOBi-One will use a Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) System. DEP provides for quiet and scale-free propulsion where electric motors provide high power to weight, efficiency, reliability, and compactness at different scales.

MOBi-One will feature redundant, digitally controlled vehicle thrust, and robust control throughout forward flight to hover with 4x cruise efficiency (lift/drag ratio) compared to helicopters.

In addition to a purely electric solution, we are working to integrate a clean hybrid propulsion system that enables our aircraft to fly continuously without recharging.

ASX is enlisting the proven expertise of Spirit, a top supplier of structures, such as fuselages and wing components, to the world’s premier commercial and defense aircraft manufacturers.

We look forward to working with ASX, an early pioneer in the emerging urban air mobility market. Spirit is actively developing new concepts, designs and solutions that will help build next-generation aircraft and solve challenges in the future. This collaboration gives Spirit the opportunity to bring our world-class capabilities to this important future market for logistics and personal transportation. —Keith Hamilton, Executive Director, Programs and Business Development for Spirit

In an article in the Wall Street Journal last September, Lettie Teague questioned why so few Americans have taken note of recent excellent Beaujolais vintages. She noted that Beaujolais, a sub region of Burgundy, includes 10 Beaujolais ‘cru’ appellations that produce serious vintages in comparison to lesser quality ‘Beaujolais nouveau’ ilk. A wine seller in New York she spoke with ‘posited that a rise in prices has been a boon to their reputation.’

Before their prices rise across the board, many of these wines still remain a bargain for their quality.

Last weekend I traveled from Bordeaux to Paris via train to attend the Wine Paris exposition and also—the evening before this event—to a tasting of wines from the Fleurie appellation of Beaujolais—held inside Le Mordant restaurant. I arrived at 5.00 p.m. and spent hours sampling dozens of these light red wines produced from the Gamay grape, most of them from the 2018 vintage.

Tasting from magnums of Fleurie wines in Paris Tom Mullen

Vines in Fleurie grow over decomposed granite, with higher slopes lacking soils and producing wines with more mineral character than those from lower, clay abundant slopes, which tend to produce fuller, more complex wines.

The name Fleurie comes not from flower (fleur), but apparently from Fleurie hill (Montagne de Fleurie) which was named after the Roman general Floricum. Of ten cru appellations of Beaujolais, those from Fleurie are renowned for their light and delicate aromas and hence the region is sometimes referred to as the ‘Queen of Beaujolais.’ On a hill sits the chapel of the Madonna—resulting in a litany of local wines being named 'la madone.' Historically, women have been critical for tending vineyards: when soldiers were away during the First World War, a group of mostly women founded Fleurie’s wine cooperative.

Fleurie wines can have both indistinct or powerful aromas of red fruit and flowers and sometimes a hit of spice. I found not one disagreeable wine at the tasting; some were exceptional. Most cellar retail prices are modest. Out of 32 wines, only seven cost 20 Euros ($21.70) or more per bottle.

Intriguing counterintuitive realities emerged during the tasting. For example, Château de Poncié Les Moriers (2018) wine is a pinnacle of quality—although it has somewhat hefty, masculine structure that differs from the lighter characteristics so quintessential of most Fleurie wines. Also, pinnaces of classical expression of Fleurie aromas and tastes—balanced and velvety—are found in wines from Gilles Copéret, such as La Madone (2018) or Les Roches (2018); yet these wines retail locally for less than 11.00 Euros ($12.00) a bottle. Price and quality (as usual in the wine world) hardly correlate.

Tasting notes.

Tasting notes are included below. Prices are local retail prices at the cellar (in Euros; also converted to U.S. dollar equivalents). These wines subjectively score between 90 and 97 points on a 100-point scale. (Specific scores can be requested via email.)

At night they descend upon the Southwind complex, a long stretch of moldy wreckage and rubble that runs along Brockbank Drive behind a chain-link fence that keeps out no trespasser.

“There is a homeless man living in my old unit,” Patricia Zuniga said of the place where she lived until Oct. 20, when The Tornado crumpled her home, destroyed her belongings and made her baby girl sick ever since. “But that’s OK.”

The 31-year-old said it’s better that this man has a ragged somewhere to go than nowhere at all. She says this because she understands better than most how fine the line between having and needing, between owning something and losing everything.

Zuniga was among the few residents of the old Southwind complex I could find out of the more than 40 low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking families living there when 140-mph winds cut through this part of town last fall. She still lives nearby, in a different complex also called Southwind, with a different owner, in a unit with unpainted walls. It is bearable for now, she said, but not for long.

“Ever since the tornado — when all the windows were broken out and there was a bunch of junk in the air — my daughter is wheezing,” she said of the girl who is now 6 months old. Zuniga ticked off a long list of ailments that have sent her child to the doctor in recent months, from parainfluenza to bronchitis (twice).

She wants to get far away from here — from her new place and the old one that still stands off Walnut Hill Lane, a blighted petri dish that I’m sure the Japan-based owners and their local reps would say is held up in insurance limbo if they ever returned messages. But where will she go in a city with few vacancies and rising rents?

Since passing its impotent comprehensive housing policy in 2018, City Hall has repeatedly reminded us that Dallas is short 20,000 affordable housing units. That policy, amended numerous times after, came without any extra money, just some guidelines now treated more like suggestions. Two years later, that number has only grown, because of rampant development and October’s disaster, which also took out, among so many other things, rows of townhouses near Marsh Lane and Walnut Hill and half a sprawling complex along Northaven Road near North Central Expressway.

“Our supply of affordable housing was so limited,” said David Noguera, head of Dallas’ housing department. “Now we just made it even more restricted.”

In Austin, the housing authority is spending tens of millions to convert old apartment complexes into affordable housing — something Noguera said Dallas is considering by making “nuisance acquisitions,” which could include tornado-damaged properties. But City Hall is like so many trying to find a place to live in this city: It doesn’t have the money. The housing department’s budget before the comprehensive housing policy was $20 million. After, too.

“You have to realize the city is like a ship, right?” Noguera said. “It’s not made to move fast.”

Four months ago, the plight of the Southwind’s residents briefly garnered local media attention as they pleaded for help and relief that never came until the Red Cross showed up days later with cold vegetable sandwiches. Activist Carlos Quintanilla threatened to sue when the owners — Samurai Global LLC, which bought the complex only three weeks before the tornado — kicked out residents for whom the uninhabitable complex was their sole shelter.

Quintanilla said this week that the owners eventually paid $1,500 to each leaseholder stranded by the storm. That covered a few weeks at a hotel, if residents could find a room.

I drive past the Southwind complex at least once a week, and have wondered ever since the storm what became of its residents — where, in this city that doesn’t even talk about its affordable-housing crisis anymore, have they gone?

Some, like Lakisha Miller-Waldrup, had to move out of the city because they could find nothing affordable in Dallas. Even then, what she found in Addison is still far more expensive than what she spent on these apartments in northwest Dallas.

""And some of my friends, my neighbors, they moved to dangerous areas,"" she said, the parts of town where rent is less expensive. ""And some people had to go back to Mexico because they had nothing here.""

Miller-Waldrup had shared a Southwind two-story with her husband and their three children, ages 19, 8 and 6. They had fenced-in front and back yards, three bedrooms, plenty of space. The family had paid $1,200 a month in rent and had been there eight months when the tornado came, snatching their roof and most everything beneath it.

Lakisha Miller-Waldrup, a former Southwind resident, said she had to move to these Addison apartments when she could find nothing affordable in North Dallas. (Ashley Landis / Staff Photographer)

They had no family with whom they could stay: Miller-Waldrup is from East Texas, her husband from Louisiana. Like many of the displaced, they took shelter in a motel after the storm. But after a few weeks, that got expensive. And it felt too impermanent, especially to young children who believe every raindrop and wind gust means the tornado is coming back.

“We just wanted a place to call home, so we looked and looked and could find nothing,” she said. They eventually found a two-bedroom box in Addison where rent is more than $1,600 a month.

Once, Miller-Waldrup said, she and her husband could take their children to the movies, the roller rink, the bowling alley. The family traveled, too, when it had a few extra dollars to spend. That extra $400 month in rent now means there is no leftover cash.

“We had to cut back,” she said. “All we do is stay at home. All my kids are squeezed into one room. We have to make sure our rent is paid. The tornado messed us up. No more having fun. We have to pay for parking now, too, and renters insurance, because we don’t want to go through that again.”

Andres Ortiz, 32, had lived in the Southwind since 2014, back when it was dangerous enough to get the attention of community prosecutors and city attorneys who took previous owners to court. “We saw someone get killed in front of us — shot in the head,” Ortiz said. That was about two years ago, before the townhomes’ recent renovations were wiped away in the wind.

Ortiz now lives with his sister and 59-year-old father in Oak Cliff in a friend’s house they’re renting while she’s away. He still works at the Walmart across from Bachman Lake, and sees old friends from the Southwind now living in motels or with family members because there are no better options.

“Pretty much everyone I know is still in the area, but they haven’t been able to settle in,” he said. “It’s hard.”

And it’s not going to get any easier.

Sandy Rollins, executive director of the Texas Tenants’ Union, said that last year, eviction filings in Dallas County rose to around 43,000, most likely for nonpayment of rent. Or, the cash-strapped were given the boot to make room for the high-priced, as we saw last year at the Bryan Song Apartments in East Dallas. Whatever the reason, the spike in evictions, too, is a crisis seldom discussed.

“There are many not natural disasters, day in and day out, in this city,” Rollins said of the rise in evictions. “There’s just a huge mismatch between people’s incomes and the availability of affordable housing. We are seeing people priced out of the market.”

That includes the former residents of the Southwind, who were just watching a Cowboys game one Sunday night when the winds came and scattered them across a city that never even bothered to find out where they went. Everyone I found wants to come back to northwest Dallas. It’s where their kids go to school, where their jobs are, where their friends live.

""I saw Andres the other day,” Miller-Waldrup said of her former neighbor still driving from Oak Cliff to Bachman Lake every day. “I hate that he’s in that situation. I am glad he’s OK, but it’s not a place he wants to be. And some of my old neighbors, they hear gunshots every night where they live now. But that was the first thing they could get their hands on. What else were they going to do?”","Since passing its impotent comprehensive housing policy in 2018, City Hall has repeatedly reminded us that Dallas is short 20,000 affordable housing units.
“Our supply of affordable housing was so limited,” said David Noguera, head of Dallas’ housing department.
Some, like Lakisha Miller-Waldrup, had to move out of the city because they could find nothing affordable in Dallas.

44,https://planetprinceton.com/2020/02/10/judge-approves-princetons-affordable-housing-settlement/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Planet Princeton,Judge approves Princeton's affordable housing settlement -,"The Thanet site is the future home of an AvalonBay apartment complex and an affordable senior housing development.

Mercer County Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson approved a settlement agreement between the municipality of Princeton and the Fair Share Housing Center on Friday after hearing testimony for about eight hours. The approval of the settlement agreement ends almost five years of litigation that was initiated by municipal officials back in 2015.

Half a dozen groups filed objections to the affordable housing plan and had lawyers present at the hearing on Friday. Objectors included the Princeton Progressive Action Group, the Old Orchard Village Homeowners Association, the owners of 29 Thanet, the owner of 375 Terhune Road, the owner of 235 Nassau Street and 25 Wiggins Street, and the owners of the Ivy Inn.

Jacobson said the hearing was to determine whether the plan protects the interest of low and moderate-income households and whether it is fair and reasonable.

“The plan does provide a reasonable opportunity for low and moderate-income housing,” Jacobson said when approving the plan after a marathon day of testimony. Jacobson also said that the town is exceeding its required number of affordable unit credits by 25 units. “It’s rare that a municipality exceeds it by as many,” she said, adding that it shows that the town is trying in good faith to provide affordable housing opportunities.

Numerous conditions must be met as part of the municipality’s plan, and a compliance hearing will be held in about four months to review whether the conditions have been met.

Princeton is one of two municipalities in Mercer County that went ahead with multi-year litigation challenging calculations for the number of affordable units the town would be required to build under COAH. West Windsor was the other municipality. Most other municipalities in the county reached settlements back in 2015.

Details of the settlement

The Princeton settlement stipulates that the municipality will be required to meet an affordable housing rehabilitation obligation of 80 units through a local rehabilitation program for rental and for-sale housing administered by the Princeton Affordable Housing Office. Five units have already been rehabilitated since 2010, so 75 units still must be rehabilitated.

As part of the settlement, it has been agreed that the municipality has met its prior round obligation of 641 units. Princeton officials have agreed to adopt a new ordinance for the consolidated municipality that requires an on-site affordable housing set-aside of 20 percent for all new multi-family residential developments of five or more units that are developed at a density of six or more units per acre.

The municipality has a third-round state Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) prospective need of 753 units. But 244 units have already been built and another four are approved but have not been built yet. The town will also receive bonus credits for certain kinds of developments like group homes.

The bottom line in terms of what the agreement means for future development: The municipality has agreed to fund 265 affordable units in 100 percent affordable developments under the settlement agreement, and the municipality will also rezone other properties for housing that will result in another 77 affordable units within those developments.

Sites to be rezoned for inclusionary development

Terhune and Harrison – The vacant site will be rezoned to permit a residential density of 22 units per acre of family housing and to remove the age restriction requirement. This is anticipated to result in 60 residential units with a required 20 percent set-aside.

A parcel of land at the Princeton Shopping Center – Princeton has reached agreement with the property owner to facilitate the development, via a zoning amendment or use of the redevelopment process, to provide a density of 6.9 units per acre on a southern portion of the 29.1 acre site for the development of 200 family rental units with a 22 percent affordable housing set-aside (or 44 affordable housing family rental units).

Thanet Circle – AvalonBay has purchased 100 and 101 Thanet. The site currently has two office buildings on it totaling 110,000 square feet. Princeton officials are planning to declare the site an area in need of redevelopment. The site will include 221 apartments. Six apartments will be affordable units, and five will be special needs apartments. AvalonBay will subdivide a 2.5-acre parcel and give it to Princeton for an age-restricted affordable housing development.

One hundred percent affordable sites funded by the municipality

Princeton Community Village – Princeton will sponsor the creation of 24 new affordable housing units at Princeton Community Village’s existing development located off of Bunn Drive.

Franklin Avenue and Maple Terrace – The redevelopment project, which will be managed jointly by Princeton Community Housing and the Princeton Housing Authority, will create 80 new affordable family rental units. The project was originally proposed to have 20 “local Princeton preference units,” but the proposal has since been modified by Princeton to eliminate the Princeton preference. Princeton will adopt a zoning ordinance providing for the proposed development. Princeton Community Housing and the Princeton Housing Authority will seek 9% tax credits. The municipality will adopt a resolution committing funding from the municipal affordable housing trust fund for the project.

900 Herrontown Road – The 3-acre, vacant site formerly housed the SAVE animal shelter. The property owner has entered into a contract with the RPM Development Group to develop a 65-unit affordable housing project (64 restricted units, plus a unit for an on-site residential property manager). Editor’s note: RPM submitted an application with NJHMFA seeking 9% tax credits in the 2019 funding round, but the application was denied in December.

The Thanet Tract Senior Development – AvalonBay will give Princeton a 2.5 acre tract located on Thanet Road for the development of an 80-unit, municipally-sponsored, age-restricted, 100% affordable housing development.

The trade off? AvalonBay will not have to pay local property taxes on the site for 30 years, and instead will enter into a payment in lieu of taxes arrangement with the town. AvalonBay will only have to pay the town 11 percent of gross income from its apartment complex at the site each year for 30 years. Developers have called the arrangement a sweetheart deal for AvalonBay.

The 80-unit senior project will not be a 9% tax credit project. The municipality will fund the project with a combination of 4% volume cap tax credits and the municipal affordable housing trust fund, and/or will borrow money for the project. The current estimated cost for the project is $15 to $20 million. The municipality must formally authorize and commit funding sufficient to fully fund the project no later than December 31, 2021.

Supportive and Special Needs Group Homes – Princeton will sponsor four group home projects that will provide16 bedrooms and earn the town 16 unit credits. Princeton agrees to provide a site, sponsor, and funding plan for eight bedrooms no later than June 30, 2021 and have those bedrooms ready for occupancy by June 30, 2022. A site, sponsor, and funding plan for the remaining eight bedrooms must be provided no later than June 30, 2024. All 16 bedrooms must be ready for occupancy by June 30 of 2025. The plans and other information must be provided to the Fair Share Housing Center on or before the date they are due.

In addition to the new units that will be built in town, Princeton has agreed to adopt an overlay ordinance to permit as-of-right, residential uses on the second and third floors of existing or new non-residential developments at a density of 15-units per acre, with a 20-percent set-aside of affordable housing, creating a mixed-use zone providing residences, shopping, and services. Affordable housing developed in the overlay areas will be credited to the municipality’s future affordable housing obligations.

Objectors concerns

The Princeton Progressive Action Group argues that the proposed municipal affordable housing overlay zone ordinances contain requirements that won’t fully achieve the goals of providing more affordable housing options. The Princeton Progressive Action Group has recommended that the affordable housing overlay zones don’t skip over adjacent properties, and that minimum lot sizes be eliminated. The group is also calling for the town to eliminate side-yard requirements unless a lot abuts a residential property, and to set height limits for each affordable housing overlay zone, but eliminate limitations on the number of stories for buildings. The group also argues that the overlay zones should be on both sides of the street in a given block. In lieu of being able to provide enough parking spaces, the group also argues that developers should be able to make payments in lieu of parking, support car shares, and support improved access to biking and transit. The issues raised by the group will be explored more during the compliance phase of the plan.

The Old Orchard Village Homeowners Association argued that the construction of a 65-unit affordable housing development at Herrontown Road at the former SAVE property isn’t appropriate, and doesn’t offer great access to transportation and other amenities.

Elsie Pang supported the Princeton Progressive Action Group, said certain provisions of the draft ordinances would prevent many property owners from implementing the overlay. Pang wants her property at 235 Nassau Street included within an affordable housing overlay zone and is also seeking to have her 25 Wiggins Street property included within an affordable housing overlay zone.

The owners of the Ivy Inn, Rich Ryan and Geoff Aton, were objectors because they believe the affordable housing overlay properties and surroundings lots should not have a 40,000 square foot minimum. They said there should be no minimum lot requirement.

Lawyers for the owner of 375 Terhune Road have argued that the property should be included in the town’s affordable housing plan given that the shopping center and another Terhune property have been included. The owners of 29 Thanet, a former office site similar to 100 and 101 Thanet, made the same argument for that property and said it should be included in the affordable housing plan.

Christine Herbert, the special master appointed by the court to assist the municipality in determining its obligations for affordable housing, told the judge Friday that municipalities aren’t required to include every property that could potentially be used for affordable housing in their affordable housing plans.

“At this point in the process, the municipality is in a position where it has vetted other sites,” Herbert said. “Just because another site could qualify, doesn’t mean they should or have to for the process to be legitimate. There is no obligation of a municipality to look at every site.”","Details of the settlementThe Princeton settlement stipulates that the municipality will be required to meet an affordable housing rehabilitation obligation of 80 units through a local rehabilitation program for rental and for-sale housing administered by the Princeton Affordable Housing Office.

It will be scheduled for an Ordinance Committee hearing as soon as possible, likely being heard in less than a month, said committee co-chair Dennis Carlone, who promised to report a date at next Monday’s council meeting.

“I think maybe councillor Carlone is still having PTSD about the 2,700 hours we spent in the Ordinance Committee talking about this,” joked councillor Marc McGovern, the other committee co-chair, after reintroducing the overlay.

The zoning is intended to eliminate design limits and development hurdles for developers putting up buildings of 100 percent affordable housing, including in parts of the city dominated by single-family homes and lacking in affordable housing. But questions on its effectiveness and approach – and, conversely, whether those opposing it were being racist, classist or just selfish – led to the certainty last year it would not get enough votes to pass. The start of a council term in January doesn’t mean just a fresh look, but a changed council that many believe now has the six of nine votes needed for a zoning overlay to become law; in the past term, only five councillors had been willing to vote it in.

Councillors’ work

That was after were more than 20 community meetings overall, including nine Housing Committee hearings, with 62 amendments proposed and 46 of them passed into the zoning to be considered, McGovern said.

He said all of those amendments are in the document councillors agreed to send on to the Ordinance Committee and Planning Board – following procedure for citizen zoning petitions, although this is a council proposal – but the “clean version” he made was perhaps an omen of the complicated conversations to come. Even after McGovern said he believed the document held only the existing, approved amendments, councillor Quinton Zondervan made a request showing caution, if not wariness: that a “red-line version [of any new changes] would be helpful.” A letter from resident Stephen Kaiser also urged a version formatted like the ones by city staff, since McGovern’s version didn’t show changes from the Aug. 29 version or, for that matter, a date or page numbers.

McGovern agreed to reformat the document as needed to show any changes since the final round of amendments last year, staying focused on moving the document forward in the process. “We heard from a few folks tonight, and even those who continue to have concerns about the overlay all said that they want more discussion. This is how we get more discussion, is we go to the Ordinance Committee,” McGovern said.

Divided public

Some 20 speakers during the public comment part of the meeting addressed the overlay, including representatives from each of the city’s nonprofit developers of affordable housing that might benefit most directly. Rebecca Schofield of Homeowners Rehab Inc. – who noted that she herself was priced out of Cambridge a couple of years ago – called it an “essential tool for building more affordable housing” that was ready “as currently proposed.” A counterpart at Just-A-Start, Lauren Curry, agreed it was “ready for enactment, and desperately needed” considering the thousands of applications received recently for a building of only 98 affordable units.

There were still skeptics among the speakers, though, who pointed to the need for traffic studies before approvals, questioned if open space requirements were adequate or reminded that for all the energy it was taking, the zoning promised almost nothing in terms of producing units – including for Cantabrigians, since the state is pressuring the city to deemphasize housing priority for people who live or work in Cambridge. There were “valid sticking points” to the overlay, and the huge number of amendments last term “showed how much work it needed. And you know, you can’t put the genie back in the bottle with bad legislation,” resident Marilee Meyer said. “Legislative surgery is needed, not this heavy-handed approach.”

“Let’s look for collaboration, not just a total win at any cost,” Meyer said. “Above all, let’s hope civility rules.”

Linkage fee

In other affordable housing action Monday, the council passed to a second reading an interim update to the city’s “incentive zoning” that sets a per-square-foot “linkage fee” for big non-residential construction. Intended to make up for resident displacement caused by bringing in new, likely high-earning residents, the fee was recommended to rise to $19.10 from the current $17.10. But at a Feb. 12 meeting of the Ordinance Committee, first-term councillor Patty Nolan proposed going up to $20.10, drawing approval of the members.

“When the rate was raised just a few years ago, it clearly didn’t have one iota of impact on the amount of development that happened in the city,” Nolan said during the committee hearing. “The sooner that we can get to a greater amount of linkage fees, the better.”","The affordable housing zoning overlay tabled in September after a year of controversy and divisiveness returned to the City Council on Monday, heading off to committee after drawing familiar-sounding public comments pro and con and some foreshadowing of councillor debate.

With the 1-Tap Switch tool, Sweet connects with the user’s provider, including all of the nation’s largest networks, to confirm the switch. Before committing to a new plan, Sweet users will be able to see their new price, device compatibility and coverage plans.

Travis Cummings is gearing up for the yearly ritual of budget negotiations with the Senate.

He addressed the House position on several matters in a brief Q&A over the weekend.

One such controversial issue that exists between the House and Senate budgets is a radically different dispensation toward the state’s land acquisition program.

The Senate wants to slot $125 million to acquire environmentally sensitive lands; the House, just $20 million.

Cummings noted that these are initial proposals, subject to negotiation.

“It is a start, and yes, we are far apart from the Governor and Senate. We own a bunch of land today and have to always consider the permanent expenditures to manage such lands. But, we look forward to engaging our Senate partners during budget conference. There are no doubt some pristine areas in our state that are worthy candidates for Florida Forever funds,” Cummings noted.

Another area where daylight exists between the House and Senate and Governor is affordable housing funding.

The Governor and Senate each want $387 million for the Sadowski Trust Fund; the House, just $144 million.

In urban areas, renters face an affordable housing crisis, with property owners holding the leverage in a tight market.

However, Cummings sees the problem as something that localities should be able to solve, in part by engaging private sector developers.

“We think local governments need to be responsible leaders in these housing initiatives, whether it be reduced zoning and regulatory barriers or incentives such as waiving impact fees etc.,” Cummings said.

“We are seeing some progress in that regard and are fortunate to have first-class developers/contractors in our backyard in Jax like Vestcor and Summit. Touring those properties and speaking to their tenants has provided me a new perspective, especially for workforce housing,” he added.

Beyond those areas, another potential negotiation point: the House vote to move the Office of Energy out of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The bill has conformed with the House budget, which contemplates the shift of the 14-member FTE office to the Department of Environmental Protection.

Cummings framed it not as an initiative of FDEP or Gov. Ron DeSantis, but as “an idea that arose in the Florida House as we looked at overall efficiencies throughout state government.”

He noted that the energy office had been at FDEP before, so the move was a “reasonable proposal.”

FDACS Commissioner Nikki Fried has contended the move is a “partisan power grab” attempt by the House, which may be more symbolic than anything else. Thus far, the Senate seems cool to the idea, and their budget maintains the status quo.","House Appropriations Chair Rep.

There’s a reference in a photo to Bukhari serving “Arabian food.” What would that be? The only way for me to find out was to step away from the screen and head over to the place. During my visits to Bukhari, it turned out that its Arabian food was generally as tasty as it was affordable and unpretentious. Also, the kind and friendly staff there were happy to specify that Bukhari served dishes with their roots in Yemen, the country that sits south of Saudi Arabia on the Arabian Peninsula, closer to Africa than it is to, say, Iran.

Article content Now, I can affirm that Bukhari serves the best Yemeni food I’ve had, which, it should be said, is also the only Yemeni food I’ve had. Bukhari, which replaced the top-notch casual Middle Eastern restaurant Pita Bell Kabab after its westward move on Carling Avenue, is one of the very few Yemeni restaurants in Ottawa. (I’ve since learned of House of Mandi on Hunt Club Road as well.) Its food is halal, prepared to Islamic strictures, and lamb and chicken are the featured meats, although a beef dish or two can also be found. The meats can be grilled, fried, steamed or stewed. Some menu items were familiar and less specifically Yemeni, including chicken and beef kebabs, chicken tikka, tabbouleh and Greek salad. But most dishes here were Yemeni — lesser known to me and listed with no descriptions. We had to ask about dishes such as chicken mandi and lamb haneed, and we were glad that we did. Before any of our orders at lunch or dinner arrived, we were given small but appetite-whetting bowls of nicely seasoned lamb broth, served with wedges of lime on the side. “It’s welcome soup,” one of the female staffers told me. Speaking of appetite-whetting, the only appetizer we tried at Bukhari was its baba ghanouj ($6), which was fresher, more herbal and much less smoky than other renditions I’ve had of that eggplant dip. Postmedia Hearty appetites would do well with one of the generous platters that pair a heap of long-grain rice with bone-in lamb or chicken. In chicken bukhari ($18), the tender half-bird was tucked in a mound of mildly spiced rice with slivers of carrot. Lamb haneed ($18) kept its rice, garnished with fried onions, separate from a foil packet filled with delectable pieces of lamb. Lamb mandi ($18) delivered pieces of shank and rib, both flavourful and toothsome, on top of rice garnished with fried onions and slivers of almonds.

Article content Postmedia jpg Postmedia All of these dishes came with plates of simply dressed green salad, dusted with tangy sumac, and a spicy, salsa-like condiment also landed on our table. We didn’t try Bukhari’s biryani rice dishes, which we were told were the spiciest among the menu. Next time. Bite-sized pieces of lamb figured in two very literally named and spicier dishes — fried lamb meat ($12) and fried lamb liver ($12). The former was accessibly tasty and quick to disappear when scooped up with pita bread. The latter packed some mild mineral tang with its heat. Postmedia Postmedia Of Bukhari’s stews, we tried ogda chicken ($10), a pleasant mish-mash of bone-in chicken, potatoes, onions, zucchini and more, and fahsa ($13), a brothy and deeply savoury concoction packed with fall-apart chunks of lamb. After we dug into the fahsa, a server came with a frothy concoction that I later learned was made with the bitter herb fenugreek. The accompaniment is called holba, and by itself, it was bracingly bitter. If I order fahsa again, I’ll trying blending some of it into the stew for another layer of flavour. Postmedia Bukhari serves breakfast, too, with a few dishes that are specific to the morning meal and some, such as fried lamb and lamb liver, that are served all day. We ordered shakshouka ($6), which elsewhere has been a dish of eggs in a spicy tomato sauce, and received instead something closer to a scrambled omelet, which was good and homey just the same. Postmedia We also had foul ($7), which was a savoury kidney bean dip served with pita. To finish, we had a very splittable dessert of arika ($12), which was a plate filled with a blend of bread, dates, and heavy cream, topped with honey and grated cheese.

“MHADA [Maharashtra Housing And Area Development Authority] will be happy to tie up with the private developers,” Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said at Confederation Of Indian Industry. “We will be equity partners and are willing to take risks.”

MHADA will pick up equity in these projects and facilitate faster approvals along with providing additional support, he said, adding that the modalities of the policy are yet to be decided.

The model, according to Anuj Puri, chairman at Anarock Property Consultants, is a good combination and will benefit all the stakeholders involved—including homebuyers. “Developers will be delighted to partner with MHADA for this,” he said, adding that private developers will bring agility, efficiency and good design. “If MHADA is on board, the project will get credibility and it will be easier to get permissions and buyers will also have more assurance as the government agency is involved.”

Awhad said Emaar Properties PJSC has shown interest to develop projects in Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The meeting between the Dubai-based developer and minister is likely to take place within two weeks.

“The day I took charge I announced that I am pro-builder. I will do whatever it takes to build affordable homes,” the minister said. “So far, we have only been facilitators. Now I feel we need to change our approach.”

The state government is also planning to carve out a part of unused special economic zone land near Mumbai—India’s costliest property market—and use it to construct affordable housing projects, the minister said. “This provision was introduced by former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra State Housing Policy & Action Plan, 2015. However, this draft policy was not tabled as a bill in the assembly. We are planning to take it forward.”","The Maharashtra government wants the state’s housing body to partner with private developers to build affordable housing projects.

For less wealthy nations, a mix of creative solutions is essential, if they are to get anywhere near meeting the ever growing demand.

A newly-formed company, Affordable Human Needs (AHN), brings the intriguingly named Earthbag Technology into the Rwandan house construction market place.

Earthbag technology was developed in the wake of the devastating Nepal disaster of 2015, as a way of constructing affordable housing, that could withstand earthquakes.

All the structures withstood a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, and the technology has now been embraced not only in Nepal, but as far afield as Iraq, and California, in the United States of America.

The innovation evolved from the construction of military bunkers and flood control methods. It requires minimal use of the normal construction material like cement, concrete, steel and timber.

The primary material used is found on any construction site. Earthbag technology uses mainly ordinary soil, and stone.



As in any normal construction, the foundations are laid in trenches, depending on the size of the house.

With Earthbag technology however, ordinary rubble, or stone rather than concrete is used for foundation. Next, comes ordinary soil, rammed into polypropylene bags, which are then stacked one onto another to form a wall. Barbed wire serves as mortar, between the layers of the bags.

The technology is simple enough, for the house to be constructed by unskilled workers, under supervision. As with any other construction, there is a right and wrong way to build an Earthbag Technology house.

The soil for instance, has to be the right consistency. If properly constructed, it is estimated that the structure could stand for hundreds of years.

Although relatively new, the basic technology has existed for hundreds of years. The Ragbeni monastery built in 1429, was unaffected by the Nepal earthquake, as were other buildings constructed in the same way.

Josephine Mukaminega is now the proud possessor of the first Earthbag house in Rwanda, joining the villagers of Nepal, and US Army veterans in California. In 2016, Mukaminega’s house was swept away by floods.

As a vulnerable person, she qualified for government assistance, and a house was rented for her, but away from her land, close to her small farm.

Fortuitously for Mukaminega, AHN chose her village of Gatwe, in the Northern Province, to pilot the first Earthbag house, and her as its first ever inhabitant. Sceptical neighbours looked on as she joined a group of locals who were trained to erect the construction.

“My neighbours were unconvinced to begin with” she said “they were bewildered, ‘will it not collapse on top of you’ they wondered. But I had confidence in our new friends, that they would build something new and special.”

For Joyce Kung, AHN’s founder, handing the keys of the first house to Mukaminega, was especially affecting. It had taken seven years to arrive at this moment, when she could see her idea become concrete reality, or should that be earthbag reality.

“I cannot express how happy I am to be here, to see the house, and to give the keys to Josephine. It has been seven years, imagining this, I cannot say how happy I am to see it happen.”

During those seven years, Joyce Kung had been travelling to Rwanda, as a member of her Church, Saddleback Church, doing some charity work.

She noted the need for not only affordable housing, access to energy and water, the basic human needs, and wanted to do more independently. That something was the creation of AHN.

Back in her home state of California, she created a volunteer team of researchers, engineers, scientists, to help her find a way of making these human needs affordable.

The result is Earthbag technology. The house is part of a package that includes a clean water filter, which uses nano technology, affordable solar panels, which also power a lamp that attracts and kills mosquitoes.

Mukaminega couldn’t more taken with her new house, declaring that “I will treasure this house”. But for Jack Lin, one of AHN engineers, Mukaminega’s house will provide much needed data on how an ordinary Rwanda family uses the technology, and whether there are any modifications needed.

Almost as excited about the new technology as Mukaminega, were local vice mayor Marie-Claire Gasanganwa, and the region’s Executive Secretary, Emmanuel Gahima, who were in attendance, as Mukaminega moved into her new home. It is to these local officials that responsibility to find affordable housing, especially for the most vulnerable people falls.

“If I could have a few more of these” mused Gahima, almost to himself, “it would help me to solve a few problems.

The house is strong, and flood resistant. The cost is reasonable, but still high. If that can come down, we can build many more houses, because the need is great.”

Gahima’s satisfaction is music to AHN Country Director, James Ngarambe, who hopes to partner with the government in its provision of affordable housing.

“We started with the Northern Province” he said, “and our target is to reach all sectors in the country.”

A basic Earthbag house comes in Rwf6,000,000, or $6,000. “We already get a lot of help from central government, and if we can find a way of using that help to lower the cost of these houses to Rwf3,000,000, we can build many more” added Gahima.","There is a global affordable housing crisis, according to the World Economic Forum.

Story Highlights The Government’s focus on providing affordable housing to Jamaicans will be among the main topics for discussion at the MoBay Expo 2020, which is slated for March 6 to 8 at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in St. James.

The discussions will be held under the theme ‘Urgent Need for Affordable Housing in Western Jamaica’ and will be led by Montego Bay Chamber of Commerce Director and Chairperson for the Affordable Housing section at the Expo, Angella Whitter.

Speaking with JIS News, Ms. Whitter said while there have been increased levels of growth in Montego Bay, this has also come with a rise in number of informal settlements.

The Government’s focus on providing affordable housing to Jamaicans will be among the main topics for discussion at the MoBay Expo 2020, which is slated for March 6 to 8 at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in St. James.

The discussions will be held under the theme ‘Urgent Need for Affordable Housing in Western Jamaica’ and will be led by Montego Bay Chamber of Commerce Director and Chairperson for the Affordable Housing section at the Expo, Angella Whitter.

Speaking with JIS News, Ms. Whitter said while there have been increased levels of growth in Montego Bay, this has also come with a rise in number of informal settlements.

“Even developments that were built within a structured framework have been forced into informal settlements. One of the basic needs of every human being is to have a place to rest their head at nights. Every parent’s role is to ensure that they provide a good base to raise their family,” Ms. Whitter stated.

She noted that the expo will also continue the discussion on affordable housing for low-income tourism workers and their families.

Ms. Whitter pointed out that the hotel sector, which remains a major driving force behind both the rental and housing markets, is driving the housing market right now.

“The same persons who are contributors to the National Housing Trust (NHT) are the ones mostly renting. So there is no doubt that there is a great need to build more houses in Montego Bay.

The increase in hotel rooms and jobs in the global services sector (GSS) has also created a high demand for housing for employees and family,” she stated.

“We know for a fact that all squatter settlements are created when we have a boom in industries like now. So we need to do everything possible to prevent having to deal with squatting or informal settlements,” she added.

Meanwhile, Minister of Tourism, Hon. Edmund Bartlett, said urgent discussions surrounding the affordability of housing for workers, especially those attached to the hotel industry, have been ongoing for some time.

“The housing conditions of hotel workers is of particular concern to me. In fact, a recent survey indicated that over 88 per cent of the workers in the sector cannot even access NHT housing solutions,” Mr. Bartlett noted.

“Subsequently, we have searched long and hard for a formula that can provide affordable housing for our workers, and we are proud of the policy shift that the Prime Minister has announced with regards to the NHT menu of benefits, which will see an increase in loan limit, reduced interest rates on NHT mortgages, intergenerational mortgages, and an increase in construction loan limit for NHT lots,” he added.

Mr. Bartlett said the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF), along with the Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ), has earmarked $1 billion for upgrading housing solutions for tourism workers.

“Our tourism workers deserve to live in clean, orderly, structured and safe communities with appropriate infrastructure. We will go beyond the call of duty to make this a norm across the island,” he added.

The Housing Agency of Jamaica, the National Housing Trust, as well as the Victoria Mutual Building Society (VMBS) are major sponsors of the expo.","Focus On Affordable Housing A Major Topic For Montego Bay Expo 2020Story Highlights The Government’s focus on providing affordable housing to Jamaicans will be among the main topics for discussion at the MoBay Expo 2020, which is slated for March 6 to 8 at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in St. James.

58,https://news.wsu.edu/2020/03/09/water-splitting-advance-holds-promise-affordable-renewable-energy/,"Mon, 09 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",WSU News,Water splitting advance holds promise for affordable renewable energy,"PULLMAN, Wash. – A breakthrough into splitting water into its parts could help make renewable energy pay off, even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.

Using solar and wind power when it is available for water splitting, a process that uses electricity to split H2O into hydrogen and oxygen, offers a way to store energy in the form of hydrogen fuel.

Currently the most popular system used for water splitting, or water electrolysis, relies on precious metals as catalysts, but a collaborative research team, including scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Washington State University, has developed a system that uses less expensive and more abundant materials. They describe the advance in a paper published in Nature Energy on March 9.

“The current water electrolysis system uses a very expensive catalyst. In our system, we use a nickel-iron based catalyst, which is much cheaper, but the performance is comparable,” said Yu Seung Kim, a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and corresponding author on the paper.

Most water splitting today is conducted using a piece of equipment called a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, which generates hydrogen at a high production rate. It’s expensive, and works under very acidic conditions, requiring precious metal catalysts such as platinum and iridium as well as corrosion-resistant metal plates made of titanium.

The research team worked to solve this problem by splitting water under alkaline, or basic, conditions with an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer. This type of electolyzer does not need a catalyst based on precious metals. In fact, a team led by Yuehe Lin, professor at WSU’s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, created a catalyst based on nickel and iron, elements that are less expensive and more abundant in the environment.

Lin’s team shared their development with Kim at Los Alamos, whose team in turn developed the electrode binder to use with the catalyst. The electrode binder is a hydroxide conducting polymer that binds catalysts and provides a high pH environment for fast electrochemical reactions.

The combination of the Los Alamos-developed electrode binder and WSU’s catalyst boosted the hydrogen production rate to nearly ten times the rate of previous anion exchange membrane electrolyzers, making it comparable with the more expensive proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.

About 10 million metric tons of hydrogen are currently produced in the United States every year, mostly by using natural gas in a process called natural gas reforming, according to the U.S. Department

of Energy. Hydrogen produced from a water splitting process that is powered by electricity from renewable energy holds many economic and environmental benefits, Lin said.

“Water splitting is a clean technology, but you need electricity to do it,” said Lin, who is also a corresponding author on the paper. “Now we have a lot of renewable energy, wind and solar power, but it is intermittent. For example, at night, we can’t use solar, but if during the day, we can use extra energy to convert it into something else, like hydrogen, that’s very promising.”

The global hydrogen generation market is expected reach $199.1 billion by 2023. Potential markets for hydrogen energy include everything from mass energy conversion and power grid management to fuel cells for cars. Lin estimates that there are approximately 600 wind farms in the United States ready for direct connections to water electrolysis systems.

In addition to Los Alamos and WSU, researchers at Pajarito Powder and Sandia National Laboratories also contributed to this work. This research was supported by the HydroGen Advanced Water Splitting Materials Consortium established under the U.S. Department of Energy and Washington state’s JCDREAM program.

59,https://www.smart-energy.com/renewable-energy/nyserda-announces-21-renewables-projects-to-boost-affordable-energy/,"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Smart Energy,NYSERDA announces 21 renewables projects to boost affordable energy,"New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo has unveiled the details of the awards for 21 large-scale solar, wind, and energy storage projects across upstate New York, totalling 1,278MW of new renewable capacity.

These projects, which New York Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and other state and local agencies will ensure are sited and developed responsibly, will spur over $2.5 billion in direct, private investments toward their development, construction and operation and create over 2,000 short-term and long-term jobs.

The awards accelerate New York’s progress towards governor Cuomo’s Green New Deal goal to obtain 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030, as codified by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and supports the State mandate for a 100% carbon-free electricity sector by 2040.

“New York continues to be a leader in developing large-scale renewable energy projects in a way that brings significant economic benefits and jobs to the state,” Cuomo said. “With these projects we will build on our aggressive strategy to combat climate change and lay a foundation for a more sustainable future for all New Yorkers.”

This milestone demonstrates New York’s real-time commitment to implementing the most ambitious clean energy agenda in the United States. Expected to generate over 2.5 million megawatt-hours of renewable energy annually – the projects will provide enough to power over 350,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by more than 1.3 million metric tons annually, equivalent to taking nearly 300,000 cars off the road every year.

The awards, totalling $1 billion in state investment, include projects that offered bids 23% lower than the bids received three years ago, representing considerable value for New Yorkers and highlighting the continuing significant cost declines of renewable energy.

The awards announced are the third in a series of annual NYSERDA land-based renewable procurements that are expected to result in the development of dozens of large-scale renewable energy projects over the coming decade.

Several of the projects awarded are expected to break ground as soon as late 2020 and all projects are expected to be operational by 2024.

As the State continues its progress towards the 2030 renewable energy target, it will also continue to emphasise and enhance engagement with the communities where projects are being developed. In order to directly assist communities, NYSERDA will also continue to offer resources and no-cost technical assistance to all cities, towns, and villages throughout the state.

The competitively selected projects include 17 large-scale solar projects, which reaffirms New York as a national leader for solar development. In addition, four utility-scale wind projects received awards, comprised of three redevelopment upgrades to existing wind projects and one new large-scale wind project. Two solar projects will include energy storage to enhance integration of renewable energy resources into the electric grid, and which will support the State’s nation-leading goal to install 3,000MW of energy storage by 2030.

Water splitting is a process that utilizes electricity to split water (H 2 O) into oxygen and hydrogen. Utilizing wind power and solar power when they are available for water splitting provides a method to preserve energy in the form of hydrogen fuel.

The most well-known system that is currently utilized for water electrolysis, or water splitting, depends on precious metals as catalysts. However, a collaborative research group, which included researchers from Washington State University (WSU) and Los Alamos National Laboratory, has devised a system that utilizes more abundant and less costly materials.

The researchers have explained this advancement in a study published in the Nature Energy journal on March 9th, 2020.

The current water electrolysis system uses a very expensive catalyst. In our system, we use a nickel-iron based catalyst, which is much cheaper, but the performance is comparable. Yu Seung Kim, Study Corresponding Author and Research Scientist, Los Alamos National Laboratory

At present, the majority of water splitting is performed by utilizing a piece of equipment known as a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, which produces hydrogen at a high production rate.

But this equipment is costly and operates under highly acidic conditions, needing precious metal catalysts like iridium and platinum and also corrosion-resistant metal plates composed of titanium.

The researchers worked to resolve this issue by splitting water under basic, or alkaline, conditions using an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer. Such an electrolyzer does not require a catalyst based on precious metals.

Indeed, a group headed by Yuehe Lin, a professor at the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering of WSU, developed a catalyst based on iron and nickel, elements that are more abundant and less costly in the setting.

The research group of Lin shared its development with Kim at Los Alamos National Laboratory, whose team consequently designed the electrode binder to utilize with the catalyst. This electrode binder is a hydroxide-conducting polymer material capable of binding catalysts. It offers a high pH environment for rapid electrochemical reactions.

The combination of the catalyst developed by WSU and the electrode binder developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory increased the production rate of hydrogen to almost 10 times the rate of earlier anion exchange membrane electrolyzers, thus making it similar to the more costly proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.

In the United States, around 10 million metric tons of hydrogen are presently produced every year, mainly by utilizing natural gas in a process known as natural gas reforming, as per the U.S. Department of Energy.

Hydrogen generated from a water-splitting process is energized by electricity from renewable energy. This hydrogen holds several environmental and economic benefits, stated Lin.

Water splitting is a clean technology, but you need electricity to do it. Now we have a lot of renewable energy, wind and solar power, but it is intermittent. For example, at night, we can’t use solar, but if during the day, we can use extra energy to convert it into something else, like hydrogen, that’s very promising. Yuehe Lin, Study Corresponding Author and Professor, School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State University

By 2023, the global hydrogen generation market is anticipated to reach $199.1 billion. Promising markets for hydrogen energy comprise everything from power grid management and mass-energy conversion to fuel cells for cars.

According to Lin, around 600 wind farms in the United States are prepared for direct connections to water electrolysis systems.

Apart from WSU and Los Alamos National Laboratory, scientists at Pajarito Powder and Sandia National Laboratories also assisted in this study. The study was funded by the HydroGen Advanced Water Splitting Materials Consortium established under the U.S. Department of Energy and Washington state’s JCDREAM program.

The power storage system uses a unique recycled aluminium based system that decreases the reliance on diesel by up to 95 percent. Interestingly, the new technology is based on the 200 year old Stirling Engine that runs solely on heat, without any emissions.

The technology represents a seismic shift for the energy sector. It halves the cost of electricity compared to diesel, whilst generating round-the-clock clean and sustainable power. The innovation is key in delivering universal access to renewable energy, especially in the African, South and Central American, Californian and Asian industrial & commercial markets where the need is greatest.

The inaguration ceremony took place at the Noor Solar Power Station in Quarzazate, Morocco, attended by representatives from the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), officials from Sub-Saharan countries, energy specialists from the World Bank and the Swedish government and others.

Over 2 billion people suffer from energy poverty – nearly 1 billion lack access to electricity whilst 1.5 billion are connected to an unreliable electricity supply, according to the World Bank Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report, 2020.

Azelio’s unique thermal energy storage system delivers electricity and heat with a total efficiency of up 90 percent and 50 percent cheaper than diesel generated power. The base of the thermal storage system is made of recycled scrap aluminium, a first for the industry.

Azelio is implementing three verification projects in 2020, one in Sweden, one with Masen in Morocco and one with Masdar in Abu Dhabi. There will be two smaller commercial projects installed this year and the company also has commercial installation plans ready in California, Oman, Jordan, Zambia and Pakistan. Industrial volume production will commence in 2021.

‘Through-the-night’ storage ‘is a key factor in making solar and wind power a robust (24-hour) energy solution. Paradoxically, the increase in solar energy also increases the need for more diesel generated electricity in order to cover the hours of darkness. Azelio’s technology addresses this by providing 13 hours of clean electricity at full power which can be adjusted also match exact demand. This represents a huge breakthrough for energy storage technology and renewable energy supply. Diesel generators are commonly used due to low investment costs but Azelio’s energy storage solution negates the need for diesel.

Using a heat element, Azelio’s thermal energy storage can be charged with solar or wind power.

A recycled aluminium alloy is heated up to 600 degrees Celsius, thereby changing from solid to liquid to maximize the energy density. With high energy density, the material has the ability to store energy for an extended period of time, with no degradation of the aluminium.

Using a heat transfer fluid, the thermal energy can be transferred from storage to a Stirling engine. The Stirling engine runs a generator to produce electricity on demand, with zero emissions and at a lower cost than diesel electricity.

Audrey Joe-Ezigbo hosted the African panel at IP Week. (Image source: Georgia Lewis)

The session was chaired by Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, CEO, Falcon Corporation and featured William Pollen, programme director, Invest in Africa; Khady Dior Ndiaye, regional vice-president and country manager, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire, Kosmos Energy; Wale Olafisan, GMD, Amni International; and a representative for Roger Brown, CFO, Seplat.

Ms Joe-Ezigbo opened the session by emphasising the role that gas, as the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, has to play in Africa’s clean energy transformation. She added that Africa can “leverage its technology, people and unique competencies” to drive the change and ensure more people have access to affordable energy.

Mr Pollen told delegates that in the gas sector, Invest in Africa has been active in facilitating investment in gas-to-power and LNG projects as well as renewable energy. This has been bolstered by significant gas discoveries in Senegal, Mauritania and Mozambique. He said it was important for the private sector to play a leading role as waiting for governments to catch up can take too long.

Ms Ndiaye said “willingness” is needed on the part of the private sector if they are to play their role in energy transformation “in an economically viable way”, and countries “can't rely on government to do all” in relation to meeting the UN's Sustainability Development Goals. She added that all countries across Africa “do not have the same trajectories” in regard to fighting climate change and transitioning to green energy, citing the example of Senegal’s heavy reliance on oil and South Africa’s heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation.

She told the conference about the importance of the major gas discovery off the coast of Senegal and Mauritania, which Kosmos is developing in partnership with BP. She said the aim should be “cheap energy for the population developed in a climate-friendly way”.

The Seplat spokesman said that Nigeria in particular has a “responsibility to meet energy transformation goals”.

“We have the resources to solve energy supply issues,” he told delegates, citing the increased use of LPG for meeting domestic needs, as well as the importance of mini-grids and micro-grids.

“Market forces have to move in - lower tariffs haven’t worked for access to electricity,” he said.

The importance of infrastructure was raised, particularly in regard to pipelines, many of which are on the drawing board in Nigeria.

Mr Olafisan said the whole African value chain needs to be developed to ensure access to energy is achieved.","Ms Joe-Ezigbo opened the session by emphasising the role that gas, as the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, has to play in Africa’s clean energy transformation.

Manchester company develops the UK’s most affordable electric vehicle

A Greater Manchester company, MeV Ltd is addressing the twin issues of reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality by producing innovative and affordable electric vehicles, the BeeAnywhere.

Without the mass adoption of electric vehicles it is unlikely that UK targets for air quality or carbon emissions can be met - something that the BeeAnywhere from MeV Ltd was specifically designed to address. The company has spent the past two years designing and developing a low-cost electric vehicle that can retail at the same price as an average car, for example an 8-year-old hatchback, rather than competing on price with new vehicle.

MeV has combined the expertise of the National Centre for Motorsport Engineering at the University of Bolton with advanced composites from the University of Manchester’s Graphene Engineering and Innovation Centre. The resulting innovative chassis design and composite body allows the vehicles to be assembled from a minimum of parts, significantly reducing production and component costs.

In contrast to other automotive manufacturers whose strategy has been to replicate an existing automobile with an electric power train, the BeeAnywhere has been specifically designed as a two-seat urban vehicle, controlled via the user’s smart phone and with the comfort, range and performance demanded by the urban environment. The company is currently building pre-production vehicles.

“Emissions free transport should not be limited to those who can afford to pay a premium” said Dr Anthony Keating, MeV CEO. “The BeeAnywhere makes electric vehicles affordable, stimulating mass adoption and offers the potential to displace millions of older polluting vehicles, especially if backed by a scrappage scheme.”

MeV Chairman Tim Harper added that for the UK to achieve targets set out in the government’s 2019 Clean Air Strategy there needs to be a rapid switch to electric vehicles and that currently there are no viable alternatives to conventional vehicles at an equivalent price point.

“The targets will not be met simply by charging for entering Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ)” Mr Harper said. “The upcoming COP26 conference gives the government an opportunity to back low carbon innovations and stimulate the creation of new industries.”

The board this week gave charges to two new committees and formally appointed members to both.

The Climate Change Committee, which will be chaired by Jack Czajkowski, will be made up of residents Jeanne Armstrong, Stephen Armstrong, Michael Docter and Joanne Goding, with Select Board Chairman Christian Stanley serving as a liaison.

Stanley said the committee will evaluate municipal energy uses, put a number to the carbon and ecological footprint of Hadley and evaluate how to promote sustainable practices.

Its charge will include identifying potential actions to confront a changing climate, help the town evaluate, choose and implement actions that are sustainable, and monitor changes in the town’s ecological footprint over time.

For the Housing and Economic Development Committee, the members will be residents Sean Barry, Emma Dragon, William Dwyer, Amy Fyden, Mark Howard, Jo-Ann Konieczny and Dylan Manz, with Stanley and fellow Select Board member Molly Keegan serving as liaisons.

Stanley said ensuring housing is affordable for young families is important and that a diminished population would affect the school systems, tax revenue and infrastructure.

“This is a way to kind of enhance that and try to find ways that Hadley can digest that would enhance our development and our future,” Stanley said.

With Dwyer also serving on the Planning Board, the new committee could unite the Select Board and Planning Board on projects and common language, and help both panels to understand better how housing projects coordinated by nonprofits such as Valley Community Development occur.

Among the committee’s charges will be identifying the current inventory of housing in Hadley, exploring resources available to build affordable housing and improve the quality of existing housing, and learning about exclusionary land-use practices that inhibit the development of affordable housing.

The committee might also work with neighboring universities to quantify the need for student housing, locate possible areas for development, and determine alternative zoning and uses, while making sure Hadley’s agricultural heritage is prioritized.

Several Palestinian children are among the wounded.

The violence on Friday has been described as some of the worst seen in Jerusalem for many years. Some 200 Palestinians and 17 Israeli Police were reportedly injured in fighting around Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount. On Saturday, protesters reportedly threw stones at police, who responded with stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons and, on Sunday, fighting continued in East Jerusalem, ahead of a planned march by an Israeli group through the Old City.

The official spokesperson for Mr. Guterres, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement published on Sunday evening, that Israeli authorities must exercise maximum restraint and respect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.

“All leaders have a responsibility to act against extremists and to speak out against all acts of violence and incitement”, the statement continued. “The Secretary-General reiterates his commitment, including through the Middle East Quartet, to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements”.

The Envoys of the Middle East Quartet (from the European Union, Russia, the United States, and the United Nations), released a press statement on Saturday, in which they expressed their alarm at “the provocative statements made by some political groups, as well as the launching of rockets and the resumption of incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel, and attacks on Palestinian farmland in the West Bank”.

Imminent risk of eviction

The Quartet representatives went on to declare their concern regarding the possible evictions of Palestinian families from homes, in which they have lived in for generations, in two neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem – Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan – and their opposition to “unilateral actions, which will only escalate the already tense environment”.

This is a reference to a court case involving several Palestinians who face eviction due to a legal challenge by the Nahalat Shimon settler organization. The risk is considered to be imminent for four of the families.

The UN has called for on the Israeli Government to halt all forced evictions and on Thursday, Rupert Colville, the spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR), warned that, if they take place, the evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah case would violate Israel’s obligations under international law.

Saturday’s fighting took place on Laylat-al-Qadr, the most holy day in the Muslim month of Ramadan, after large numbers of worshippers had prayed at the Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount compound. In their statement, the Quartet

Envoys called on the Israeli authorities to exercise restraint and to avoid measures that would further escalate the situation during this period of Muslim Holy Days.

“We call on all sides to uphold and respect the status quo at the holy sites”, the statement continues. “All leaders have a responsibility to act against extremists and to speak out against all acts of violence and incitement”.

The statement concluded with a reiteration by the Quartet Envoys of their commitment to a negotiated two state solution.

37 Palestinian children injured and arrested

On Sunday, the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, urged the Israeli authorities to refrain from using violence against children and release all those children detained.

In a joint statement, Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, and Lucia Elmi, UNICEF Special Representative in the State of Palestine, noted that 29 Palestinian children have been injured over the past two days, and a further eight arrested. “A one-year-old toddler was among those injured. Some children were taken for treatment at hospitals, with injuries in the head and the spine. This comes amid reports that nearly 300 people were injured in the area”.

The senior UNICEF officials said that the agency had received reports of ambulances being restricted from arriving on location to assist and evacuate the injured, and that an on-site clinic was reportedly hit and searched.

The statement called for all children to be protected from violence and kept out of harm’s way at all times, for families’ rights to access all places of worship to be preserved, and for those injured to be assisted without restrictions.","Several Palestinian children are among the wounded.

As the world is battling to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, civilians should take extra hygiene precautions to ensure health and safety. Though keeping your homes clean is an essential part of daily life and general well-being, now it's more important than ever to disinfect certain surfaces on a daily basis, especially as you’re encouraged to stay home as much as possible. If you’re wondering how you can keep your home germ-free or if someone is sick in your home, here are 5 affordable ways to keep bacteria and viruses at bay.

1. Hard Surfaces: Bleach Mixture

Bleach is one of the most common household cleaning products that you most probably already have at home. Besides using it to remove stains from fabric, you can also use it to clean hard surfaces. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using a bleach solution by mixing 5 tablespoons (⅓ cup) bleach per 4 litres of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per litre of water. You can store the solution in a spray bottle and use it to clean hard surfaces. As it’s a harsh cleaning agent, do wear gloves to protect your skin. You should also keep it away from metal or paint as prolonged exposure to bleach can cause damage to these materials.

This table shows the average cost of cleaners effective at cleaning viruses on hard surfaces

2. Soft surfaces: Phenolic Disinfectant Spray

For carpets, sofas and other soft surfaces like pillows, mattresses and bedding you can’t put in the washer, use a phenolic disinfectant spray to mist the entire surface, and let it set for up to 10 minutes to allow the active ingredients of the spray to work. Not only does a scented spray kill viruses and bacteria, it also keeps your furniture smelling fresh. It can also be used on clothing made of fabrics that cannot be washed. Allow the disinfectant to air-dry on the surface. If a surface might end up in a toddler’s mouth, use a oral-safe disinfectant such as the Spick disinfectant spray.

This table shows the average cost of cleaners that are effective at killing viruses and bacteria on soft surfaces

3. Bathroom: Hydrogen Peroxide

Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as a disinfectant in a healthcare setting. According to the CDC, “3% hydrogen peroxide is able to inactivate rhinovirus within 8 minutes.” The CDC also states that “commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant when used on inanimate surfaces.” You can use it to disinfect your bathroom, sinks, toilet, countertop and even toothbrush. Hard surfaces in the bathroom should be disinfected twice a day as they are the most exposed to bodily fluids. As for your toothbrush, soak it in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes and rinse it thoroughly with hot water.

4. Electronics: Alcohol Wipes

We touch electronic devices like laptops, keyboards and mobile phones every day and these need to be sanitised daily. Professional care alcohol wipes such as the ones used by nurses to remove bacteria off your skin before an injection will do the trick. These wipes can also be used to disinfect remote controls, tv, monitors and game consoles.

This table shows the average cost of disinfecting wipes at different retailers

5. Fabrics: Laundry Sanitizer

Bacteria isn't limited to living on hard surfaces. Even your clothes, towels and sheets are susceptible to bacteria and viruses. While washing your clothes regularly and drying them in high heat may effectively rid them of harmful bacteria, some fabrics may be damaged in high heat. In this case, a laundry sanitizer will come in handy. A bleach free phenolic laundry sanitizer kills harmful bacteria, and removes mildew and odour. Pour the appropriate amount into the detergent drawer of your washer according to instructions on the packaging, or mix 1 capful in 2.5l water with detergent and soak for 15 minutes before washing in the washer or by hand. You should note that viruses and bacteria contaminate different fabrics at different levels, so you should be mindful of what fabrics you wear or use (especially if you or someone in your home is sick).

This table shows the average cost of laundry sanitizers that are effective at killing viruses and bacteria

A Little Goes A Long Way

Just because you should be sanitizing and disinfecting your home a few times a day doesn’t mean you need to use as much of it as possible. Be cautious of the toxic effects of prolonged exposure to chemicals such as bleach, which can cause irritation when left on skin and lung problems when inhaled. Always use cleaning agents according to packaging instructions and wear gloves while disinfecting your home. This way, you can keep your home germ free while making the cleaning solutions last for as long as possible, which saves you money in the long run. Lastly, you should remember that in the event you get sick, your health insurance and the government are promising to cover any COVID-19 medical emergencies.

The property at at 3101 Castle Hayne Road, Castle Hayne, North Carolina will provide space for Habitat to build 30+ homes.

“New Hanover County is committed to improving access to, and availability of, affordable housing in our community,” said County Manager Chris Coudriet. “Most recently, Commissioners conveyed four county-owned pieces of land to Cape Fear Habitat and supported Habitat by funding the extension of water and sewer service to their new housing development off Gordon Road. This 14-acre conveyance is another step in aiding Habitat’s mission, which is good for our community and for our workforce.”

In 2018, the county established a Property Conveyance for Workforce Housing Policy, to allow for the conveyance of county-owned land to qualified nonprofits who have been in existence for at least two years, with a core mission to provide workforce housing. Properties conveyed under this policy must be developed with owner-occupied, taxable housing.

“This generous land donation by New Hanover County Commissioners will allow us to build a development with at least 30 new, affordable homes in the Wrightsboro area,” said Cape Fear Habitat for Humanity Executive Director Steve Spain. “We make it our mission at Habitat to create affordable homeownership opportunities for our neighbors who earn between 30 and 80 percent of the area median income, and we couldn’t accomplish what we do without valuable community partnerships, like New Hanover County.”

The potential for a workforce housing development on this site was first discussed by Commissioners at the Spring 2019 joint county/city workshop on housing. In addition to the developable land for Habitat, the site also includes 1.5 acres that will remain county-owned for a possible future fire station.

With the property authorization, Cape Fear Habitat for Humanity will be responsible for extending water and sewer utilities to the site and making any required sewer connections to existing homes. Habitat will also ensure that the stormwater infrastructure constructed for the residential subdivision is sized, designed, and permitted to incorporate all required stormwater controls for the future fire station, with all necessary easements, permissions, and off-site stormwater agreements granted.

“New Hanover County is committed to improving access to, and availability of, affordable housing in our community,” said County Manager Chris Coudriet.
“Most recently, Commissioners conveyed four county-owned pieces of land to Cape Fear Habitat and supported Habitat by funding the extension of water and sewer service to their new housing development off Gordon Road.

(Bloomberg) -- Market contagion surrounding China Huarong Asset Management Co. is fading less than six weeks after credit investors reeled at the prospect of a default by one of the country’s most important state-owned companies.But while the tentative recovery is good news for Beijing’s attempts to instill more credit-market discipline without triggering a financial crisis, it could be a bad omen for any China Huarong bondholders still counting on a government bailout to make them whole.Spreads on investment-grade dollar bonds have tightened after hitting a nine-month high at the height of the panic, and yields on offshore junk notes are lower than at the end of March, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Tencent Holdings Ltd. recently secured $4.15 billion in one of Asia’s biggest dollar bond deals of the year, while Bank of China Ltd. units raised the equivalent of $2.35 billion in a multi-currency bond sale. At least ten Chinese borrowers were marketing or have sold dollar bonds this week, leaving the period set to be one of the busiest this year.The same is true of other indicators of stress in China’s financial system. While rising corporate defaults spilled over to the country’s money markets in November, there are no such signs of concern now. Banks are having no trouble borrowing from each other, judging by the declining cost of one-year interbank debt. The overnight repo rate fell below 1.5% last week for the first time in two months.Some market watchers say the relative calm could embolden Beijing to impose losses on China Huarong’s creditors.“Markets are getting a signal as loud and clear as one blasted from loudspeakers: China’s policy stance of ‘no debt guarantees’ has been extended beyond local government SOEs to large, national-level SOEs,” DBS strategists led by Taimur Baig wrote in a May 3 note. “Markets should know that these are not mere platitudes, if Huarong serves as an example.”Reducing moral hazard has become a priority for President Xi Jinping as he seeks to make the nation’s state-owned companies more efficient and better run. Ensuring the equity and bond markets reward and punish firms for their corporate behavior, rather than relying on the cumbersome state system, is a relatively new approach. There are signs it is working. SOEs have replaced their private counterparts as the country’s biggest source of defaults.Allowing a debt restructuring at China Huarong, one of the country’s biggest financial conglomerates, would send a strong signal of the government’s resolve. The company’s dollar bonds due 2025 traded at well above par at the end of March, despite the trial and swift execution of its chairman Lai Xiaomin in January for bribery. They’re now priced at about 80 cents on the dollar. Recent high profile defaults by two university-linked companies, Peking University Founder Group Corp. and Tsinghua Unigroup Co., have served as additional warnings to investors dabbling in borrowers with ambiguous ties to the state.Even after the rout in China Huarong’s bonds, some investors are still betting Beijing will stand behind the company. It has so far met all of its debt obligations on time and has said it is operating normally with sufficient liquidity. A China Huarong vice president recently said downgrades by international rating agencies “have no factual basis” and are “too pessimistic.” The comments, which were carried in the state-run Shanghai Securities News, were viewed by some observers as a signal of continued state support.The nation’s banking and insurance regulator has also said China Huarong has ample liquidity, though it has yet to provide clarity about the company’s future or what penalty bondholders might pay, if any, to help fix its debt issues.Curtailing implicit guarantees won’t be easy for China, given that they also backstop the nation’s stocks and currency. But there are signs of a broad shift. The “national team” of state-backed funds has become less influential in the equity market, while China allowed the yuan to weaken past the key support level of 7 per dollar in 2019 for the first time in more than a decade.Of course, there’s no guarantee that credit markets would remain calm if China Huarong announced a restructuring or default. Given the firm’s sprawling and complex business, investors have little clarity over how such an event might ripple through China’s $54 trillion financial system. And because China Huarong hasn’t released its 2020 financial results, the state of its balance sheet remains a mystery.Still, the fact that signs of a broader credit-market panic have subsided without major intervention from Beijing are likely to be of comfort to officials seeking to tackle China’s moral hazard problem.“It is a success as good as can be for policymakers, without using a heavy-handed approach,” wrote the DBS strategists.(Updates third paragraph with details on Chinese borrowers selling bonds.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","While rising corporate defaults spilled over to the country’s money markets in November, there are no such signs of concern now.

72,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/technophile/redmi-note-9-pro-review-specs-price-comparison/article31151804.ece,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",BusinessLine,Redmi Note 9 Pro review: Elegant design meets affordable pricing and flawless performance,"No doubt, Xiaomi and its gadgets are extremely popular in this part of the world and the success stems from the fact that the Chinese gadget-maker was able to put a finger on consumer requirements and it was able to provide them under an affordable price tag.

Xiaomi sold nearly 43 million units of smartphones in 2019. The smartphone giant controls nearly 30 per cent of India’s smartphone market.

The Redmi Note 9 Pro, the latest from the Xiaomi stable, promises to be bigger, better and snazzier while sticking to its pricing legacy. The device is the first to hit the market in these tough times (Covid-19) and had a soft launch of sorts. But reports suggest the device has been doing brisk sales online despite the overall market concerns.

The Redmi Note 9 Pro comes in three colours: Glacier White, Interstellar Black and Aurora Blue. We have the Blue for review.

Premium looks

The Note 9 has got incredible looks. This is a beauty, no doubt. The strong glass panel on the back looks premium-elegant and super shiny, gathers little dust or fingerprints, and is easy to clean with a soft cloth.

The glass panel is powered by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which is quite impressive given the price tag. The glass sheet comes with an anti-oil and anti-fingerprint protective coating. The phone is a little heavy, at 209 grams, but you can still handle it with one hand. The glass body is slippery so you are advised to exercise some caution while handling it, especially while placing it on a slippery surface. It can withstand moderate falls but you’d better watch out. Xiaomi’s cases are available in the market, and you may use one, but that might look like a little compromise on the looks.

Specs

The Redmi Note 9 Pro is 165.75 mm long, 76.68mm wide and has a thickness of 8.8 mm. Indeed, the phone looks and feels big. There are two RAM variants available: 4GB and 6GB (with 64GB and 128 GB storage). The phone’s display is extravagant at 16.9cm (6.67 inches) FHD+ with a resolution of 2400 x 1080. The phone offers three display modes: standard mode, sunshine mode and night mode and allows for colour temperature adjustment. The display is no less than a delight at this price. Movies, images, documents, presentations — everything is displayed truthfully and the image enhancements are done with some robust understanding of display aesthetics and not blindly. The Redmi Note 9 Pro should warm the cockles of streaming fans as it offers seamless streaming in FHD+ and the feeling one gets while playing videos are of near 4K, especially if you have a good broadband connection and have access to UHD content.

Performance

The Redmi Note 9 Pro is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 720G processor. The 720G is enhanced for mobile gaming and the chip supports HDR video playback and high-definition streaming quite efficiently. The processor is great with artificial intelligence-powered functions and helps execute them in an energy-efficient way.

Clearly, this is reflected in the performance of the Redmi Note 9 Pro. The phone plays most big-bang games with ease and without any lag. We ran the latest versions of Call of Duty, PUBG and Asphalt 9 and the experience has been quite impressive. We didn’t experience any delays or heating. The graphics performance is supported by Adreno A618, again from Qualcomm, which powers most mid-range phones in town today.

Like most Redmi devices, this is also a multi-tasker. Surfing and streaming can be done simultaneously without interruptions. Opening multiple tabs (this reviewer is used to keeping dozens of them open in one ago) seems easily manageable and navigating between them is smooth, which makes this a great assistant to researchers and business persons who usually surf and select a lot on the go.

Shoot in style

The Redmi Note 9 Pro comes with a quad-camera unit on the back. The first thing you’d notice and be impressed by the camera unit is its placement on the back panel. The four cameras are packed into two neat rows and the entire unit forms a cute square on the back, below which sits the flash, like a white bindi. The 48 MP rear camera set up includes a 48 MP primary camera with 1/2.25 inch CMOS image sensor, with an aperture of f/1.79 (offering you great depth of field and rich detail), an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens with an aperture value of f/2.2, a 5MP macro camera with 2cm focus distance and a 2MP depth sensor. The camera unit offers a 10x digital zoom as well.

The still camera offers several features, many of which are aided by the latest AI. There are the ultra nightscape mode, AI scene detection, smart ultra-wide angle mode tilt-shift, level display and such. Most users would find these useful. That said, the most interesting faculty here is the 48 MP lens. It captures images in abundant detail and in daylights the shots can match any mid-range DSLR output. The AI is not biased towards saturation or brightness and does a decent job in making the photos look natural and crisp. Even the night shots are pretty good for the price even though images get pixellated a lot, which happens if you are not a pro at mobile phone photography. But with proper lighting, the output is a class apart.

One of the most striking features of the Redmi Note 9 Pro is it allows for 4K video (30 fps, still 4K is 4K). That’s a lot given the price range. The camera can shoot in 1080P (60fps and 30fps) and 720P as well. The extra-wide angle lens works wonders with the Redmi Note 9 Pro. If you are a landscape soul, the Redmi Note 9 Pro is your best buddy. The camera manages to get great depth of field and the auto-focus department responds fast enough.

The 16MP front camera takes bright and clear selfies with decent depth. Surprisingly, it can take good landscape shots as well. The front camera has a slew of features such as panorama selfie, palm shutter, AI silhouette detection, HDR and a clutch of AI functions. The front camera can take videos in full HD (1080P) and HD (720P) resolution and the quality is extremely good. To us, the most striking feature with the front camera is the way it negotiates ambient light. This faculty is inarguably the best in the class.

Features

Another interesting feature is the finger-print sensor which got a transfer to the side from the back. The recent Poco X2, a Xiaomi sub-brand, too has the finger scanner on the sidebar. This is convenient but you need a little patient while negotiating it. Like it happened in our case, you run the risk of touching the finger print sensor unknowingly while holding the phone and leaving the device unlocked until you find out soon enough.

The Redmi Note 9 Pro has a single speaker at the bottom. The audio is clear and measured at mid-volume levels but gets jarring at highs. This means while playing games, you better connect it to an external portable Bluetooth speaker.

The call quality and audio recording capability of the Redmi Note 9 Pro is very premium thanks to the two noise-cancelling microphones. The audio recorded is of broadcast quality (short-filmmakers, take note). The phone comes with a massive 5020 mAh Li-Polymer battery, which lasts long enough even if you surf and stream to your heart’s content. As usual, the MIUI 11 is unimpressive and the bloatware is annoying. The device takes a USB Type-C reversible connector port for charging. The phone supports 18W fast-charging and gets powered up pretty fast. This is a dual-sim device and both slots support 4G connectivity. The storage is expandable up to 512GB.

In sum, sparing minor blemishes, this is a phone you can proudly flash around and for sure you’d grab some eyeballs.","The Redmi Note 9 Pro, the latest from the Xiaomi stable, promises to be bigger, better and snazzier while sticking to its pricing legacy.

Westchester County’s 2020 Fair and Affordable Housing Expo will take place on Saturday, March 14 at The Westchester County Center in White Plains from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Westchester County Executive George Latimer invites residents from across the County to attend, driving home the message that safe, affordable housing should be a basic right for everyone living in Westchester County.

Latimer said: “Those who attend the Affordable Housing Expo can meet with realtors, mortgage lenders, inspectors and not-for-profit housing counselors who will be available to answer their questions. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the Affordable Housing Process, and the County’s commitment to creating more fair and affordable housing opportunities across Westchester.”

Throughout the day, various workshops will be held to help answer questions such as:

Am I eligible for affordable housing?

Is it better to rent or own?

I’ve heard there is a new law that offers protection to renters; how can it help me?

How much money do I need for a down payment?

Are there any programs that help with down payments and closing costs?

What is the importance of credit, and a good credit score?

What is the role of the not-for-profit counselor, the realtor, inspector, the attorney and the lender?

The first workshop of the day begins at 11:45 a.m., and is all about available resources for down payments, closing costs and home improvements. At 1 p.m., a workshop on Fair and Affordable Housing will discuss affordable homeownership and rental opportunities, as well as the application and selection process. Counselors will be available all day to demonstrate how to navigate Homeseeker, a website that provides information about affordable home ownership and rental apartment opportunities in Westchester.

At 2 p.m., a workshop entitled Rental Housing will provide visitors with an opportunity to meet with not-for-profit counselors, who will advise and describe the process of finding affordable rentals.

The list includes a plug-in hybrid Kuga crossover, conventional hybrid sedans, and mild hybrids for popular small cars, like the Fiesta, Focus, and Puma. But this doesn’t mean Ford doesn’t have EVs in the works.

The UK’s Business Car website reported today that the company will leverage its relationship with VW to develop EVs for small cars. Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford Britain, said:

The prioritization for us is to democratize electrification, and that is to go where the volume is.

That means Ford’s best-selling models in the UK, the Fiesta and Focus, will need to be electrified, and not just with mild hybrids. Barratt said that just because those small models had hybrid options didn’t “suggest we are not working on an EV or PHEV Fiesta and Focus. And it doesn’t suggest that we have disregarded them.”

Ford features hybrids in its “Go Electric” roadshow

Ford launched its European “Go Electric” Roadshow, shown above, in London last month. Stuart Rowley, President of Ford Europe, told the Sun:

We’re still developing the alliance with VW, and there will be at least one, probably two passenger vehicles built off the MEB platform, and they will be at a lower price point than the Mustang Mach-E.

We asked Ford today what those hints about a new electric Focus or Fiesta could mean for its global EV efforts. John Gardiner, executive director of communications for Ford of Britain, replied:

Last year, we announced one BEV model based on the Volkswagen MEB platform for Europe, starting in 2023. This will be a potential of more than 600,000 units over its life cycle, which starts in 2023. We’re also looking at the potential for a second vehicle, which is under consideration.

2023 feels like a long way off. But as Barratt pointed out, Ford’s relationship with Volkswagen is its the path forward. He said:

We can jointly share the scale effect on that MEB platform, and that is really important because the market is very small at the moment, and so we really need to amplify that volume and get the scale benefits. Working with Volkswagen is really going to allow us to do that and get those products to market at an affordable level, but still with all the functionality and features you would expect.

Electrek’s Take

Ford’s signature EV is the Ford Mustang Mach-E. But as Darren Palmer, Ford’s product chief for EVs, told us in late January, the new Ford electric vehicle was at first going to be a second-generation Focus. Palmer said:

The Mustang Mach-E car was going to be a Focus BEV Version 2. It would have been a new platform.

Maybe a new and improved, affordable Ford Focus Electric was a good idea after all

Instead, Ford developed an electric powertrain for a crossover SUV.

Just how critical is Ford’s relationship with VW for even more affordable, smaller EVs — especially for Europe? Very.

Even before the coronavirus shut down factories and cut off sales, the company had big financial problems. As we reported a few weeks ago, Ford COO Jim Farley said the company has a “sense of urgency and crisis.”

Now its partnerships with VW and Rivian are coming into sharper relief. Without them, Ford’s EV program looks very American (rather than global) with a Mustang-inspired SUV and an electric F-150. Considering that Europe is now the global capital for EVs, Ford’s electric platforms need to get sized to what’s driven across the pond.

With VW helping to reduce the costs of parts and production for smaller EVs, and perhaps Rivian doing the same for larger electric models, Ford can make the necessary investments in its global electric-car future.

With this in mind, it’s wise to press reset every once in a while, and this simple philosophy is the ethos for the small-but-powerful skincare brand Krave Beauty.

Founded by beauty influencer and YouTuber Liah Yoo, Krave Beauty was started with the mindset of returning to the days “when skincare was a fun way to practice self-care… When skincare was simple.”

“We’re here to #PressReset on your skincare routine,” the brand’s website outlines.

Running with this motif of simplicity and renewal, the brand boasts a compact range of five products — one for each designated stage of a standard skincare routine: cleanser, toner/exfoliant, serum/treatment, moisturizer and SPF.

Take a look at the full range of products below that have received the stamp of approval from Gen Z and millennial skincare lovers and even estheticians, below:

Cleanser

With Krave’s Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser serving as my personal go-to cleanser for over two years now, I can firmly stress that this product’s formula is unlike any other.

Made of matcha, hemp seed oil and vitamin B5, this cleanser is perfect for those who want a deep clean without compromising or stripping their skin’s moisture barrier. “Hydrating” is the most fitting word that can be used to describe this product’s formula as it leaves the skin soft and supple and ready for the next product’s application — Not to mention it’s only $16!

Toner/Chemical Exfoliator

The next step in most people’s routines is usually toning and exfoliating.

While most estheticians recommend chemical exfoliants over physical — as the latter is said to cause micro-tears in the skin, creating wrinkles over time — these tend to be overpowering for some skin types and can cause varying levels of irritation.

Story continues

Krave Beauty’s Kale-Lalu-yAHA — get it? “AHA” as in alpha-hydroxy acids? — is literally made with energy-boosting ingredients and leafy greens like kale, spinach, parsley and sugar-cane derived glycolic acid to promote slow cellular turnover. As with any exfoliator, this should only be used a few times a week.

Serum/Treatment

Though tying with the next product as the brand’s priciest item, this $28 “skin-soothing serum” is perfect for those moments when your skin is inflamed and is in need of a hug.

Ringing true to the brand’s mission, this nourishing formula “offers irritation skin a reset button” with its unique formulation of ingredients. It is made with skin-regenerative tamanu oil and plant-based safflower and rosehip seed oil as well as ceramides and squalane to calm the skin down after its barrier has been compromised.

Sweetening the deal, with every purchase of this product, donations will be made to help protect the Great Barrier Reef, which houses the world’s largest coral reef system.

Moisturizer

Introducing Krave Beauty’s latest release and the next step in your skincare sequence: moisturizer.

This cream’s function is in the name: “so simple.” The Oat So Simple Water Cream is described as a “no-frills” moisturizer that’s created with less than 10 ingredients, making it the perfect way to feed your skin without any worries of irritation — just “some good old-fashion hydration.”

Oats are listed as the main ingredient in this product as it is said to “invite your skin into a state of ZEN.”

Sunscreen

Last but never least on the roster is sunscreen. No matter the season, your complexion or age, SPF is a necessary component to your skincare routine and this option from Krave Beauty is, in my opinion, the leader of the pack.

Many people’s love-hate relationship with sunscreen comes with the white or gray cast it leaves on most skin tones — especially folks with deeper complexions. Krave’s Beet Shield is formulated in a liquidy texture that applies to the skin like a light moisturizer, leaving no white cast at all! — and coming from someone with deeply melanated skin, this is a pretty big deal.

Formulated with beetroot extract, allantoin and vitamin C, The Beet Shield is described as “a lightweight, non-white cast leaving formula” that “fights against the free radicals so you don’t turn beet-red.”

Maple Automobile, a company run by Geely’s technology subsidiary, Geely Technology Group Co., last week released an illustration of the initial vehicle, the 30X subcompact crossover.

The first 30X, to be marketed under the Maple brand, rolled off a production line at a plant in Nantong in east China’s Jiangsu province in January, Maple Auto said.

The electric crossover is 4,005 mm long, 1,760 mm wide and 1,575 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,480 mm. It has a range of 306 kilometers on one charge.

Pricing has not been disclosed.

Maple Auto previously was Kandi Technologies Corp., a company that built two-seat and subcompact EVs. Geely last year increased its stake in Kandi to 78 percent from 50 percent and renamed the company.

With Maple, Geely continues to expand its EV product portfolio.

Geely, China’s largest domestic car and light-truck maker, currently markets EVs under the mass-market Geely brand and a dedicated EV subbrand, Geometry.

Geometry is positioned higher than the Geely brand in the EV market.","Zhejiang Geely Holding Group is set to begin sales of the first model under a newly created brand for value-priced electric vehicles.
Maple Automobile, a company run by Geely’s technology subsidiary, Geely Technology Group Co., last week released an illustration of the initial vehicle, the 30X subcompact crossover.
The first 30X, to be marketed under the Maple brand, rolled off a production line at a plant in Nantong in east China’s Jiangsu province in January, Maple Auto said.

Ass Hair Trimmer,"Mr. Sato acknowledges that he has butt hair, and (sort of) does something about it.

The other day, our crack reporter Mr. Sato was in a pensive mood, ruminating on how often we know so little about ourselves. He doesn’t know what manner of darkness lurks in his subconscious, for example.

Also, he doesn’t now what darkness lurks in his own butt hair.

“I always believed I had no butt hair,” he explained. “Okay, okay…I always tried to convince myself that I had no butt hair. But whether I acknowledged it or not, it’s been silently growing.”

“But is this how a man lives his life?” he shouted. “Is it OK to go on living like this?”

We weren’t sure if he was asking us, himself, or the heavens, but apparently he had the answer to his question. “No! Such cowardice suits no man! A man faces life’s challenges head-on!” he cried out, voicing his fiery resolution to, figuratively, put his head up his ass.

▼ “A man named Sato, 46-years old, ready to face his butt hair.”

And so it was that Mr. Sato ran full-speed to the nearest branch of discount retailer Don Quixote, then ran full-speed back with something called the Osu! Ketsuge Trimmer.

▼ Osu is the way manly men greet each other in Japanese, and ketsuge means “ass hair.”

The Osu! Ass Hair Trimmer costs just 1,480 yen (US$14.30), which was good, because while Mr. Sato was prepared to bid farewell to his butt hair, he wasn’t eager to part with much of his money.

Removing the trimmer from the package, he found that it looks sort of like a compact electric face razor. There’s also a dedicated cleaning brush, since if you’re using a brush to clean something you stuck in your butt, odds are you don’t want those bristles touching anything else.

A key difference between the Osu! Ass Hair Trimmer and regular razors, though, is that the OAHT has a mirror on it.

▼ “So this will show me my butt…”

The razor is powered by four AAA batteries, and when Mr. Sato switched it on, it began to hum and vibrate ever so slightly as the blades turned. There’s also an LED light right below the mirror.

▼ Just as Mr. Sato lights up our lives, the Osu! Ketsuage Trimmer was ready to light up his butt.

And with that, it was time to get to trimming.

▼ Arrow showing Mr. Sato’s back

▼ “Here we gooooooooo!”

However, no sooner did he squat down and reach a hand between his legs did Mr. Sato run into a roadblock impeding his progress towards his smooth ambitions.

Or, perhaps, a roadcock. As he reached down and began to wrap his hand around towards the target zone, his bulge got in the way, and he couldn’t see the mirror.

Now, for some people this won’t be a problem, and no, we’re not trying to brag about the size of Mr. Sato’s package here. In order to see what’s going on in the mirror, you have to look down at a pretty steep angle. That in itself isn’t a problem, but Mr. Sato’s eyesight is such that has to wear glasses, and leaning over enough to see the mirror means they’ll slip off his face.

If you’ve got good eyesight or wear contacts, this shouldn’t be an issue, but for Mr. Sato it meant that using the Osu! Ass Hair Trimmer would require one of two things:

1. Maneuvering mechanically moving blades around his butthole with no visual reference, something he wasn’t prepared to do.

2. Asking one of us to be his spotter and give him verbal guidance as we observed the process from close-up, something none of us are, or ever will be, prepared to do.

And so Mr. Sato is yet to actually use his butt hair trimmer. We were tempted to ask him what happened to all of his blustery confidence about how a man handles adversity, but considering the hardships his nether regions have endured in the line of duty, we can’t really be too hard on the guy for not taking yet another one for the team.

Unfortunately, this means that Mr. Sato’s indeterminate amount of butt hair is as luxuriously thick as it ever was, if not more so due to new growth in the time since these photos were taken, but should he feel the need, there’s always the route of asking for professional help.

80,https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-5-3-nokia-1-3-nokia-5310-2020-specs-features_id123128,"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",PhoneArena,Check out Nokia's latest affordable smartphones and modernized feature phone,"







Alongside the upper mid-range Nokia 8 .3 5G, a trio of significantly humbler phones is going official today with minimal fanfare. Without further ado, here are the most important things you should note about the Nokia 5 .3, 1.3 , and 5310.

The Moto G Power has a stiff competitor in the Nokia 5.3





No, the Nokia 5.3 doesn't come close to the insane 5,000mAh battery capacity of the recently unveiled and as-yet unreleased Moto G Power , aka G8 Power. The 6.55-inch display of the freshly announced Nokia mid-ranger is also inferior to the Full HD+ 6.4-inch panel on the aforementioned Motorola device with an HD+ pixel count of 1600 x 720 and a small ""selfie notch"" instead of a trendier hole punch design.









But the Nokia 5.3 and Moto G Power share a more than respectable Snapdragon 665 processor with an octa-core CPU composed of a quad 2.0 GHz Kryo 260 Gold cluster and four Kryo 260 Silver cores clocked at 1.8 GHz. That should strike a very solid balance between energy efficiency and speed, especially when you consider the up to 6GB RAM count of the Nokia 5.3 as well.





The Nokia 5.3 and Moto G Power also have an exceptionally versatile multi camera system in common, although the former phone comes with an extra imaging sensor on its back, while the latter actually wins the megapixel battle between the two. Nokia's newest mid-ranger has a whole bunch of photography tricks up its sleeve, taking 13MP ""normal"" pictures, using a 5MP ultra wide-angle lens for group shots and capturing beautiful landscapes, as well as leveraging a 2MP macro lens for extreme close-ups and a 2MP depth sensor for bokeh effects.





Powered by a pure version of Android 10 on the software side of things right out the box, the Nokia 5.3 is unsurprisingly ""ready for Android 11 and beyond"", which seems to suggest at least two major OS updates are guaranteed. Coated in Charcoal, Cyan, and Sand, the handset also comes with a ""Nordic inspired design"" combining a 2.5D glass front and scratch-resistant ""composite"" back, as well as a solid 4,000mAh battery and 64 and 128GB storage options to go with 3, 4, and 6GB RAM variants.





The Nokia 5.3 will be available ""globally"" starting in April at an extremely reasonable ""average"" price of 189 Euros for the 6GB RAM/64GB ROM configuration. That means this bad boy could cost less than $200 in the US if it ever lands there.

The Nokia 1.3 is nothing to write home about





Okay, the waterdrop-style notch is pretty cool for an entry-level, ultra-low-cost smartphone. But the overall design is nothing special, with fairly thick screen bezels and a plastic rear cover housing a single 8MP camera. The Moto E6s , for instance, looks much better than the Nokia 1 .3, which also packs a terribly modest 1 gig of memory in addition to 16 gigs of internal storage space and a quad-core Snapdragon 215 processor.









For what it's worth, the Android 10 (Go edition) OS onboard here doesn't require a lot of RAM to run smoothly. The Nokia 1.3 comes with a 3,000mAh battery that doesn't sound all the bad either, especially when paired with a very frugal 5.71-inch display sporting a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels.





The global average retail price is set at 95 Euros ahead of an April release, with no words on US availability just yet.

The Nokia 5310 marks the return of yet another classic





Not even the coronavirus pandemic can make HMD break with its tradition of reviving popular ""dumb"" phones from another era. The modernized Nokia 5310 follows in the footsteps of 2017's 3310 , 2018's 8110 , and 2019's 210 with a focus on music consumption.









Unfortunately, this is still a feature phone running the Nokia Series 30+ OS rather than Android, which means Spotify and Apple Music support are nonexistent. On the bright side, the Nokia 5310 (2020) can play MP3s and FM radio on a pair of front-facing speakers purportedly capable of ""filling the room"" with sound. What's perhaps even cooler is the dedicated music buttons of 2007's Nokia 5310 XpressMusic are making a comeback here, alongside an ""elegant and clean"" numeric keypad and a 5-way navigation key.





The durable design is nicely refined to include curved display glass and rounded corners, while the battery life is as stellar as ever, rated at up to 30 days of endurance in standby mode on a single charge. As you can imagine, the reborn Nokia 5310 is cheaper than cheap, at 39 Euros, looking at a ""global"" commercial debut later this month.

HMD Global was initially supposed to unveil its latest batch of Nokia-branded handsets ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 23 , but for pretty obvious reasons, that never happened . Neither did the company's rescheduled London event today , as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the old continent at all levels of society, although life goes on and tech outfits are finding ways of adjusting to the new normal.","The Moto G Power has a stiff competitor in the Nokia 5.3No, the Nokia 5.3 doesn't come close to the insane 5,000mAh battery capacity of the recently unveiled and as-yet unreleased Moto G Power , aka G8 Power.

81,https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/be-swept-away-by-affordable-luxury-in-port-douglas/3985870/,"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Daily Mercury,Be swept away by affordable luxury in Port Douglas,"I’m not quite sure of the exact moment it happened.

Maybe it was the “food theatre” of Harrisons owner and executive chef Spencer Patrick delicately unwrapping the paperbark from the baked coral trout at our table, filling our nostrils with its delightful smokiness and skilfully carving it like a surgeon.

Was it the realisation that every night’s a Friday night on lively Macrossan and Wharf streets – when we wanted to join the throng at “happening” bars instead of heading back to our rooms after a big day.

Or was it while drifting off to sleep as therapist Taylah worked lavender and geranium oil into my back during the couple’s massage at Vie Spa.

It could have been as early as that first flop on the kingsize bed before soaking up the thrill of an in-room spa bath and that view of seemingly endless lagoon pools at Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort.

No. I think the turning point of knowing I’d been wrong to underestimate Port Douglas came as I stood barefoot and hatless with one hand clasping a champagne flute of sparkling wine and the other hand the side of the bow as the Sailaway VI Lagoon 560 catamaran glided out of Crystalbrook Superyacht Marina to literally sail into the sunset.

That 360-degree vista – dominated by yachts on the Coral Sea, mountains shrouded in a misty veil and the thick dark green blanket of vegetation that is the Daintree Rainforest – won me over and summed up the feeling of three glorious days and two stunning nights in one of the world’s holiday hot spots.

It was enough to convince me: Port Douglas, you’ve changed. But in a good way.

Fun. Exotic. Sophisticated. Sublimely beautiful. If Port Douglas was a woman, she’d be a supermodel – minus the attitude.

She has come a long way since our first encounter on a year-long trip around Australia in 1996.

Millionaires’ playground or backpacker haven: Port Douglas back then seemed to me to have little for middle-ground travellers – those who appreciate good service, who want to be “wowed” and feel like they’re living it up but without worrying how much this would cost.

This time, Port Douglas fitted the bill of affordable luxury nicely.

And if the majestic tropical surroundings and spectacular-coloured waterways of the World Heritage-Listed Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest aren’t enough to lure you just 70km or a 45-minute scenic drive north of Cairns, maybe the famous hospitality and Port Douglas’s new-found fame as a foodie scene might.

We were spoilt for choice – right from a welcome dinner at Salsa Bar and Grill where the Seafood Moqueca (white fish, prawns, squid, red claw yabby and mussels) with Portuguese rice introduced us to North Queensland’s finest catch without leaving the tastebuds on fire.

It continued the next day at Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort and Spa, where an indulgent lunch began with finger foods including figs, cheeses, hummus, beetroot dip, pastrami, and pickled delights at a table overlooking the centrepiece pool.

A parade of waitstaff kept the dishes coming: a delicate deep-fried bug entree, pan-seared crispy skin barramundi with corn salsa, parsnip puree and fresh parsnip with sides of broccolini and chips.

A dessert platter of bite-size sweets including coconut ice, white choc and caramel slices to die for was the icing on the cake.

But to truly feel like you’ve had a vacation, you need to slow it down.

The five-star Sheraton Grand Mirage champions everything we love about the North Queensland lifestyle and sits in 147ha of lush tropical gardens.

The complex boasts an 18-hole golf course and more than 2ha of lagoon-style saltwater pools plus one freshwater pool with swim-up bar.

Financed by development tycoon Christopher Skase in the late-1980s boomtime, the resort was relaunched in 2016 following a $43 million rejuvenation.

The refurbishment celebrates chic coastal living with a nod to the glamour that has always been part of the resort’s DNA and attracted celebrities such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, Mick Jagger, John Travolta and George Clooney.

Time spent in a poolside cabana or on a lounge under a wide white umbrella does wonders for mind, body and soul

Four Mile Beach Port Douglas. Picture: Shirley Sinclair

But we truly found our holiday zen at morning yoga on Four Mile Beach – the ace up the Tourism Port Douglas sleeve.

Waves gently lapping the shore. An almost impenetrable line of palm trees and casuarinas forming a green barrier to the rest of the world.

A cloud-kissed mountain backdrop cloaked in green. Soft cream-coloured sand with the occasional coconut, a ribbon of harder golden grains left from high tide and blue-green water the colour of Chris Hemsworth’s eyes.

The gentle voice of Noeline Clarke took us through our changing positions.

We cleared our thoughts, monitored our breaths, found our rhythm.

And that’s what Port Douglas does best: it gives you time to breathe. To concentrate on what’s important in life. To take time out for you. To put back the balance.

You’ll sweat out the bad stuff in the Tropical North Queensland sun and humidity.

But you’ll also replenish energy and feel brand new, ready to face the everyday world again.

Harrisons takes fine dining to the max

Spencer Patrick and wife Reina spent a year travelling Australia looking for the perfect spot for the restaurant of their dreams.

They found it in Port Douglas, poolside at Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort and named it after their young son.

The most nationally awarded restaurant in Port Douglas and No. 38 in the latest Delicious Top 100 Restaurant Guide across Australia lives up to its reputation for modern Australian cuisine.

Spencer is the author, director and star of the show. He trained under the much-lauded British restaurateur and chef Marco Pierre White and was part of the team that earned The Restaurant Marco Pierre White three Michelin stars.

On this beautiful starry night in Port Douglas, Spencer is as generous with his time and conversation as he is with serving his paperbark coral trout – available as a special request.

This is a pinch-myself moment.

Yet Harrisons is as much laid-back as it is special occasion, with a light, tasty, seasonal North Queensland menu that brings together the paddock-to-plate/sea-to-plate ingredients in unusual yet more-ish combinations.

The farmed citrus-cured cobia ceviche with finger lime and local coconut milk plus toasted coconut and green chilli is so light and fresh we wanted to lick the plate clean.

The fresh ingredients and the light touch of the dishes ensures we don’t overindulge to the point where we must abstain from dessert … and coconut mousse and camomile sorbet with burnt butter crumb and Davidson plum gel is an offer too good to refuse.

Get carried away on the breeze at sunset

The Sailaway Sunset Cruise, as owner-operator Steve Edmondson points out, is all about sailing.

It’s not a dinner cruise, so guests can relax and soak up the natural surroundings over 90 minutes.

It operates every night, year-round and is such a romantic experience that some people just can’t help but be swept up in the moment.

Steve said more than 30 spontaneous marriage proposals had taken place under sail in the golden ambience of the tropical sunset.

Sailaway – recognised for its sustainable eco-tourism practices – has been operating luxury sailing experiences for 17 years. And it shows.

Long before a silver sun throws diamonds on the water as we make our way out of Crystalbrook Superyacht Marina, crew members have laid out platters of hot and cold canapes and delivered our drink orders.

As we glide past the quaint old Sugar Wharf building, locals on their daily afternoon stroll along the waterside promenade and travellers on camping chairs having afternoon drinks in the palm-treed Rex Smeal Park wave us off on our journey.

By the time we’ve eclipsed Flagstaff Hill Lighthouse, we already feel like rock stars.

Any afternoon on the water is a good afternoon and we settle in to good conversation and a passing parade of vessels from authentic Chinese junk Shaolin to like-minded yachties getting some wind in their sails.

We return just as the lights of Hemingways Brewery and the marina twinkle back into brightness.

82,https://allafrica.com/stories/202003161082.html,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AllAfrica.com,Namibia: Affordable Housing Delivery Slow - Ithete,"DEPUTY finance minister Natangue Ithete has conceded that the government has not been quick and effective enough in the provision of serviced land in urban areas and affordable housing for the masses.

He, however, added that the government is committed to providing decent housing and has partnered with the private sector in executing some key developmental objectives.

Ithete, who was speaking at the RTO (Rent-to-Own) housing launch by the Ongos Valley Development project, said housing is a basic need and those tasked to make it available should price it correctly.

""I call upon you to put humanity before profit. Price your property in such a way that you aim to recover costs with minimum profit rather than maximising it at the expense of the homeless,"" the deputy minister advised.

Touching on the RTO project, Ithete said it is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) meant to provide and administer an alternative financing method for property ownership through an instalment sales model.

""I am reliably informed that this model will be applied exclusively for 1 000 homes within Ongos Valley Development. Rent-to-own is a way to buy or sell something over time, giving the buyer an option to purchase at some point in the future,"" he added.

Confirming Ithete's sentiments, RTO Namibia's chief executive officer Innocencio Verde said the 1 000 housing units are part of the 4 457 housing unit development at Ongos Valley situated 13km north-west of Windhoek's central business district.

""Namibia's housing challenges are undoubtedly complex and well-documented. They exist in part due to the fact that the supply of housing and or existing housing stock is by far less than what is needed or too expensive, hence the RTO initiative,"" he said.

To ensure the completed 1 000 housing units are purchased, RTO in partnership with other investors, will raise the capital on a debt and equity basis, across the spectrum of different housing units on offer at Ongos Valley.

""Meanwhile, the SPV will sell the residential units to natural persons in terms of an instalment sale agreement. The SPV will enter an agreement to sell a residential property to natural persons. In terms of the agreement, the purchase price shall be paid by way of monthly instalments over a period exceeding one year but not exceeding five years,"" he added.

The Namibian reported last month that the slow servicing of land, as well as speculation among private developers, are pushing up land prices, especially in Windhoek.

This has also caused a mismatch between demand and supply of land in the city, a First Capital Namibia report indicated.

In the report, First Capital said the average price of land in a middle-income suburb of Windhoek, such as Khomasdal, is 11 times more than it is at Keetmanshoop.

Equally scoring big from the high housing prices are the banks that have invested over N$50 billion in the property market of which a larger part is residential houses.

According to the World Bank, RTO works well when a country has financing tools, such as bonds issued for multi-family development, the state has a land bank or other systems of lowering the cost of land as well as transparent, efficient, fair, and clearly targeted demand-side subsidies, among other things.

Alcohol-based hand sanitiser, which contains at least 60 percent alcohol was considered a helpful measure in preventing the spread of Covid-19.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, sales of hand sanitisers have soared and it became a highly sought-after product that pharmacies and supermarkets have started limiting the number of products that people can buy at once.

Prices of basic commodities, including sanitisers have shot up, making the food basket unaffordable to many Zimbabweans.

CCZ executive director Ms Rosemary Siyachitema said hand sanitisers and soaps must be prioritised as basic commodities.

""As you know the prices have been rising, the consumer basket has been going up and the prices of basic goods have been rising. What we consider now as important are hand sanitisers and soaps hence we want consumers to afford those goods,"" she said.

Meanwhile, prices of basic commodities have increased by up to almost 100 percent this week thereby pushing the prices beyond the reach of most consumers.

Shops, including big supermarkets, have increased prices of basic goods such as bread, maize-meal, cooking oil, meat, rice and vegetables among others.

A snap survey carried out by The Herald yesterday revealed that prices of basic commodities have increased by almost 100 percent.

A two-litre bottle of cooking oil, which was selling at around $79 has increased to $114.

The price of a 10kg bag of mealie-meal has been increased from $130 to about 262,99 while the price of a standard loaf of bread has also gone up from $24,99 to $26,99 and Bakers Inn is selling at $30,50.

A kilogramme of salt now costs $25,99 and the price of a litre of milk has increased from $25,99 to $34,99 while that of a packet of 2kg rice has increased from $48,99 to $93,99.

A 2kg packet of chicken cuts is now selling for between $232,99 and $184 depending with the brand, while the price of a kg of beef is now pegged at $175,99 or more depending on the quality.

Consumers in Harare on Monday said that prices of most basic commodities were no longer affordable.

Mr Takudzwa Chara, a taxi driver, said the prices were not commensurate with the levels of salaries people were earning.

If this trend of price increases is not controlled, people will fail to feed their families. People are already struggling to put food on the table and something must be done urgently to rein in retailers. Food is there in the shops but people cannot afford the prices,"" he said.

Ms Mercy Mushava, a civil servant, said most workers' salaries were no longer enough to buy just the basics, making it pointless to go to work.

""The prices we are seeing in these shops are frustrating given our meagre salaries,"" she said.

Mrs Mushava said it was time Government put in place measures to control prices especially of basic commodities that people cannot do without.

Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers president Denford Mutashu said the increases were necessitated by some suppliers who were now demanding cash on delivery.

""The increases are suffocating the consumers who are hapless under the current situation.

""It is, however, a chicken and egg situation as suppliers have been increasing prices into the sector at a faster pace, citing rising costs.

""Some suppliers are demanding payment in cash or United States dollars, which pushes sector players to the parallel market,"" Mr Mutashu has said.","The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) has urged relevant authorities to make affordable and avail sanitisers and soap as basic commodities to reduce the spread of the deadly Covid-19.

This is mainly because most of them do not have the capability for clean and sustainable energy which major corporations do tend to have at their disposal. Spanish start-up Solatom is working towards bringing a well-known technology to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One that generates steam via solar energy, a system currently used almost exclusively by large factories.

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems generate energy by using mirrors that track sunlight which is then absorbed in order to generate energy. However, due to the economies of scale this technology is cost-effective primarily for large plants. Focusing on steam generation, which most factories need for several types of processes, Solatom’s founders have come up with a way to make this clean technology commercially cost-effective on a smaller scale. Which in turn enables SMEs to reduce their energy pollution and costs.

Miguel Frasquet, co-founder of Solatom, spoke with Innovation Origins about the motivation behind the start-up and their goals

What motivated you to set up Solatom?

The thing is that half of the founders, including myself, come from the field of CSP technology. This technology generates steam, and that steam is fed into a turbine which generates electricity. We knew this was only being used by huge factories. The thing is that four out of ten factories – at least in Spain, but probably pretty much everywhere else I think – use steam for their industrial processing.

Most people don’t realize it, but you need steam for everything. For example, you need it at dairy and meat factories, for preserved products, to dye clothing and in the production of plastics and drugs. In short, you need steam for almost everything.

So, we knew that a lot of industries use steam and we knew that by using CSP technology they could generate steam in an affordable and clean way. But the problem was that CSP is only economically viable on a massive scale. Which meant that it could not be utilized in some factories because they are too small. That’s why we chose to focus on these smaller factories. Which, even though they’re perhaps less well-known than their major counterparts, do account for between 92% and 98% of the industry. Large corporations represent just 2%. After plenty of research and designs, we managed to bring this technology to SMEs in a way which is cost-effective for them.

How?

Well, after all the research, the final result is a pre-assembled CSP module that fits into a shipping container. Please note that most CSP plants are usually around two to three square kilometers in size. Our module generates 15 kilowatts. Consequently, you need to connect multiple modules in order to be able to reach the energy capacity that’s required. They connect to each other like a Lego bridge. What we achieved with this, is that we are cost-effective for small scale use. Since we ship everything pre-assembled to the client, we don’t need to send too many materials, equipment, or personnel. So, it’s a very attractive solution for SMEs.

Why are CSP plants so big?

Those massive plants are built because scale economics are needed to ensure that they are economically viable. That means that when you want to use the same technology in a SME, those scale economics don’t count anymore because the factory it is simply way smaller than the CSP plant. Which makes it far too costly for small-scale factories. What we did – instead of doing what it is normally done in a CSP plant, as in, building everything on site – was to pre-assemble everything. Then all we had to do was ship it to the client for them to use. The greatest challenge of course was actually designing something that could be pre-assembled.

So, if clean technology like CSP is generally only cost-effective on a large scale, we can presume that SME plants produce the most pollution?

Exactly. The reason why is because, in Spain, for example, you consume vast amounts of energy if you happen to be Coca Cola or Heineken. Yet you are located very close to a city because you have heaps of employees, which means your location cannot be isolated. This allows these companies to burn natural gas. Of all the fossil fuels, this is the cleanest one.

But in the case of SMEs, they are usually not located close to cities. Moreover, most of them are isolated form the natural gas grid. So, they are burning other kinds of fossil fuels. Like diesel, which pollutes the environment way more than natural gas, and is also far more expensive. So, those industries are the ones that have a real energy problem. Since they aren’t able to burn less toxic fossil fuel because there is no grid available there. Which is why we want to bring this clean solution to those companies.

Was it difficult to set up the start-up?

Yes, well, in our case we faced many challenges from the outset. One, which might come across as being a bit strange, came from our family and friends. We all had very good jobs before starting Solatom. So, they were not sure that we were making the right move. But they are very supportive now. The second challenge one was securing funding.

With Solatom, we are not doing something digital. We are making something physical which entails having it built at full scale. So, it was really difficult to be able to have an MVP (minimum viable product). You know, something that we can show the industry and that you can test. This was the reason why we, the founders, had to put a lot of money in ourselves, approximately €60,000 between us.

After that we constructed our first module. We needed to try it out, but we didn’t have anywhere to install it. When you approach potential clients, they don’t necessarily trust you right away. In any case, we negotiated with one company. We could install our solar module on their location, and they would only pay us if it worked. So, it was very risky. However, looking back I think it was the only way to procure our first client. Fortunately, the module worked.

What’s in store for the future of Solatom?

At the moment, we are booking a lot of success in Spain and are growing very fast. At least we were before the coronavirus crisis hit. We are also starting to look at other markets. We are evaluating Africa, because their energy systems are virtually nonexistent. Which means most of their factories are using highly toxic energy sources which are also very expensive. Solatom could really help out there.

87,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2020/04/08/affordable-storage-technologies-key-to-bringing-solar-energy-to-scale-in-india/,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",pv magazine India,Affordable storage technologies key to bringing solar energy to scale in India,"This challenge has often been overshadowed by the other issue of pending dues to the state-owned distribution companies. But it does merit a much deeper focus, given the variable generation from renewable sources; the need for continual energy access in India’s far flung, off-grid areas; maintaining grid stability by matching demand and generation; and the lack of battery-related mineral resources in India.

The Energy Storage System Roadmap for India report estimates storage requirements for solar to rise over 3-fold from ~50 MWh in 2019 to ~175 MWh by 2022. With the country reaching only halfway in its target of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 (which includes 100 GW of solar), storage solutions will hold the key to bringing solar energy to scale.

Storage-plus-solar options are inevitable for several segments. In off-grid or mini-grid systems, they can ensure round-the-clock power access. For e-vehicles, affordable and indigenous batteries can reduce the battery cost from the current ~50%+ of the car’s price, thus creating the needed traction in India’s e-vehicle sales.

Rooftop solar that otherwise faces an issue of varying net metering policies across Indian provinces, would benefit from storage as it would allow rooftop users to consume more of the power generated, while placing more solar systems on the grid without having to spend to expand it.

Further, it would not only help consumers avoid the high tariff of peak hours, which in India is in the evening when solar is not generated, but would also help better demand-side management. Grid-scale energy storage would improve the management of distribution networks, reducing grid congestion, voltage variations, costs and improving grid balancing, efficiencies and energy security.

Recent years have seen efforts to build India’s battery storage capacity. The 2019 National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage includes phased manufacturing programs focusing on battery factories and e-vehicle manufacturing. Recent announcements include XNRGI USA’s 240 MWh lithium-ion battery factory in Haryana for rickshaws, e-bikes, etc.; Tecchren USA’s 200 MWh lithium ion battery plant and Ojovati Singapore’s lithium-ion battery plant in Andhra Pradesh; Phinergy Israel’s partnership with IOCLfor field-trials of its metal-air batteries for e-vehicles; Ather Energy’s MoU to set up a lithium-ion battery factory in Tamil Nadu; and Urja Global’s MoU to make lithium-ion batteries in Andhra Pradesh.

Three pronged challenge

While lithium-ion batteries became popular owing to their lightweight, compactness and a better charge-discharge efficiency, a three-pronged challenge plagues domestic manufacturing in India. Matching the price to the imported versions, especially those from China which benefit from its major subsidy programs, is one. Another is that the availability of two key minerals used in lithium-ion batteries is highly concentrated – lithium in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina and cobalt in the D.R. Congo. That implies India would still face a sizable import bill, just like it does under fossil fuel energy production. Last, R&D into alternative technologies are yet to pick up in a big way in India, not to mention the constraints related to technology-transfer it raises.

Nevertheless, India is making initial forays into alternative technologies. Pune-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research and SPEL Technologies are co-developing a technology to generate functionalized graphene at lower costs, which would develop graphene supercapacitors (supercapacitors are electrical devices that store electrical charge).

Chennai-based Elicius Energy provides resources to companies using storage technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells. These fuel cells offer clean power as well as an increase in the power density at lower upfront costs. Tata Power is pilot testing a 35MWh gravity storage installation with Energy Vault of Switzerland. Gravity storage elevates a mass while charging/storing energy and lowers it while discharging/using that stored energy. But a question remains regarding their affordability.

R&D partnerships

At the same time, the country should deepen R&D partnerships for alternative technologies. Last year, it did enter an agreement with China for cooperation in R&D to develop new technologies for solar cells from alternate materials. But much more is needed given India’s targets. For instance, Canadian researchers are working on green energy storage by developing a catalyst by combining non-toxic metals in an amorphous structure. Electrolyzers use this to convert electricity from renewable to chemical energy by splitting water to hydrogen and oxygen. The chemical fuels can be stored and converted to electricity.

SwitchDin of Australia enables virtual power plants and microgrids by integrating different brands of batteries and inverters in the market, thus leading to better monitoring and site management. Sodium technologies like saltwater batteries are coming into focus as they do not contain heavy metals and are easily recycled. In short, ramping up further R&D capabilities is the first step to develop affordable and efficient indigenous batteries.

Declining prices of battery systems globally (from US$1,000/kWh in 2010 to $230/kWh in 2016, as per a McKinsey study) along with falling solar tariffs, makes it an opportune time to scale up investments in battery technologies. The push towards e-vehicles in India, at least for urban public transport and government procurements, augurs well towards this goal. The reduction of feed-in-tariffs or net metering payments in India is another tailwind.

India must capitalize on this combination of tailwinds and opportune timing to develop affordable battery storage capabilities and achieve, at least to the best extent possible, its solar target of 100 GW by 2022.

Accessible housing is an important factor in fighting the effects of the coronavirus, and in countering future public health challenges

Georgie Davis is Reall’s head of communications and external affairs.

We have a grandstand view of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe rolling towards the urban centres of Africa and Asia. As industrialised countries grapple with their response, the one billion people currently living in slums in poor countries lack the most basic necessities, such as toilets, handwashing facilities, space and access to medical care. They will be at the epicentre of the Coronavirus disaster.

As the global Covid-19 pandemic escalates and tightens its grip, the need for affordable housing at scale is more urgent than ever – not only for this emergency but also for preventing future pandemics from tearing through poor urban communities and to resuscitate economies decimated by the disease.

THE PANDEMIC WILL NOT BE EQUALLY FELT

It’s clear that a global response that requires staying at home, washing hands and social distancing simply will not work for those people currently living in inadequate shelter. At present only one in five slum residents in urban Africa have access to clean and safe water.

This crisis is global and can only be addressed with global efforts. However, the effects of the pandemic will not be equally felt. In the context of Coronavirus and quarantine the relationship between housing and health has never been more acute.

INTERCONNECTED

Covid-19 demonstrates just how interconnected the world really is. We are all in this together. An uncontrolled pandemic in the slums of Africa and Asia is as much the world’s problem as one in Italian ski resorts or downtown New York. Our collective response must support those on low incomes for the benefit of us all.

This is an urgent time for innovation and finding new and better ways to tackle our global challenges. Today there is a deficit of 50 million houses in Africa and 70 million in South Asia and 300 million new homes will be needed by 2030. Affordable housing has long been side-lined but is the most comprehensive and sustainable humanitarian response we have in the face of the current pandemic and future public health catastrophes.

INVESTING IN HOUSING

Investing in the widespread construction of decent, affordable housing needs to be a top priority now more than ever. It’s clear that investing in affordable housing solutions delivers on many fronts - for healthcare, pandemic protection and prosperity. Creating an asset that futureproofs and builds in resilience ahead of unanticipated crisis will buffer families living on low incomes against such shocks.

REBUILDING ECONOMIES

Coronavirus is a disaster like no other. The first wave is the disease - then in its wake a second disaster – the decimation of fragile emerging market economies which will leave poor communities reeling.

While we don’t know for sure how quickly the pandemic will take to recede, the lessons of history suggest that a substantial economic recovery will require global economic cooperation. Affordable housing must be a foundational part of any post-Corona economic recovery plan.

The combination of Covid-19 and the escalating housing crisis in Africa and Asia, is one of humanity’s greatest challenges. Yet affordable housing could hold the key to solving and preventing both crises.

UNTAPPED $17 TRILLION MARKETPLACE

Reall estimates that building affordable housing at scale represents an untapped $17 trillion marketplace - dwarfing America’s $2 trillion coronavirus aid bill - the largest economic stimulus package in US history.

Big infrastructure projects in the form of affordable housing could kick start more resilient economies helping people on low incomes manage the direct fallout of Covid-19 on their livelihoods. Reall have proved we can build decent, sanitary homes at an average cost of $9,200 per house. And every house built creates at least five direct jobs.

FRONTLINE DEFENCE

Solving this crisis in the form of affordable housing will drive macroeconomic growth, stimulate job creation and financial sector deepening, mitigate climate change, and enable billions of people to escape the poverty cycle.

Covid-19 reinforces the crucial importance of Reall’s mission of building a movement that improves the life chances of 100 million people in urban Africa and Asia. A safe and sanitary home with running water, clean energy and enough space is the future frontline defence against pandemics.","INVESTING IN HOUSINGInvesting in the widespread construction of decent, affordable housing needs to be a top priority now more than ever.

89,https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/04/05/affordable-access-to-water-is-a-fundamental-human-right/,"Sun, 05 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",News@Northeastern,Affordable access to water is ‘a fundamental human right’,"Affordable access to water is an issue that affects every household in the U.S. and is made even more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, says Martha Davis, a professor of law at Northeastern who has been promoted to University Distinguished Professor.

In the U.S., water authorities often shut off water when customers fall behind in their payments. But without access to water, families may be forced to go to other people’s homes, or outside to wash their hands or buy water, she says. In response, some states, such as Michigan, have ordered a moratorium on water shut-offs while shelter-in-place orders are in effect. Davis argues that the pandemic should make communities rethink how they handle the question of access to affordable water.

Experts project that by 2022, 36 percent of households in the U.S. will struggle to pay their water bills. A 2019 report written by Davis in collaboration with Sharon Harlan, a professor of health sciences and sociology, and Laura Senier, an assistant professor in sociology and anthropology and health sciences, looked at policies regulating the affordability of water in 12 communities in Massachusetts and how local and state laws across the U.S. influence access to drinking water.

“Water that is affordable, as well as accessible and safe, is a fundamental human right,” the report states.

Among its most important findings, the report found that some cities shut off water to discourage payment delinquency, while others convert unpaid water bills to tax liens, which has sometimes led to foreclosures and loss of housing. In addition, the report showed, though rising water costs plague homeowners and renters alike, they tend to fall hardest on people of color who are low-income.

To cope, water customers reported making significant sacrifices, found Northeastern doctoral student Mariana Sarongo, another member of the team. One interviewee said she was cutting back on needed medications to afford water, while another participant said she was unable to afford a money-saving vegetable garden because it cost too much to water the produce.

“COVID-19 makes clear that these issues are not simply individual problems, but should instead encourage community-wide responses to ensure affordable water for all,” says Davis, who is also associate dean for experiential education at Northeastern.

The title of University Distinguished Professor is the highest honor the university can bestow upon a faculty member. It is conferred at the behest of Northeastern’s president, Joseph E. Aoun, and provost, Ken Henderson, upon faculty members who have earned international recognition and distinction for their transformative educational and scholarly contributions.

Davis says she appreciates the support from her law school colleagues who nominated her, describing the recognition as “the honor of my life.”

“I am particularly pleased to receive this recognition because of the increased visibility it will give to the law school’s human rights work—particularly critical given the COVID-19 crisis—and the NuLawLab, the law school’s dynamic innovation engine,” she says.

Davis was nominated by several members of the Northeastern law faculty, including Emily Spieler, Margaret Burnham, Richard Daynard, Daniel Medwed, and Michael Meltsner.

“Professor Davis brings to all of her pursuits fiery intelligence, intellectual honesty, extraordinary energy, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to the furthering of justice and law—law in theory and law in practice, as well as innovation in law to expand access to justice,” they wrote in their nomination letter.

Davis, who is also associate dean for experiential education and a faculty director for the law school’s Program on Human Rights and the Global Economy and the NuLawLab, is a member of the expert pool for WaterLex, a Geneva-based development organization that advocates for water and human rights.

In addition to water affordability, she has written on human rights, women’s rights, and social justice issues. She co-edited “Global Urban Justice: The Rise of Human Rights Cities,” which examines cities that base their local policies on human rights, a text to which she also contributed a chapter, titled “Cities, Human Rights and Accountability: The United States Experience.”

Davis co-authored the first law school textbook on human rights in the U.S., titled “Human Rights Advocacy in the United States,” and she co-edited “Bringing Human Rights Home,” a three-volume text chronicling the human rights movement in the U.S. Her book, “Brutal Need: Lawyers and the Welfare Rights Movement,” received the Reginald Heber Smith Award and was also honored by the American Bar Association. Her articles have appeared in numerous publications, including the Yale Law Journal, the North Carolina Law Review, and Fordham Law Review.

Prior to joining Northeastern in 2002, Davis was vice president and legal director for the Legal Momentum. Formerly known as NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the organization is the oldest legal advocacy group for women in the U.S.

As a women’s rights practitioner, Davis litigated a number of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, and argued Nguyen v. INS, a case that challenged sex-based citizenship laws. She has also completed fellowships at the Bunting Institute, the Harvard Law School, and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

“Confronting COVID-19: Considerations for Multifamily and Affordable Housing,” hosted jointly by ULI’s Terwilliger Center for Housing and the Institute’s Responsible Property Investment Council, was the third in a series of ULI webinars exploring how the virus is affecting the real estate industry, along with the industry’s response.

The webinar is free to access on ULI Knowledge Finder.

Megan Sandel, codirector of the GROW clinic at the Boston Medical Center, co–lead principal investigator at Children’s HealthWatch, and associate professor of pediatrics at Boston University, discussed the relationship between housing and physical and mental health. The coronavirus pandemic has spotlighted how housing can serve much like a “vaccine” that helps foster greater social equity and promote overall well-being, Sandel said.

Four factors that define place—quality, stability, affordability, and location—have been elevated in importance by the outbreak, demonstrating that “you cannot separate your health from where you live,” she said.

Social factors—both positive and negative—affect health outcomes, Sandel said, noting that the pandemic has underscored the interrelation of social factors such as access to food and stable housing as health determinants. “Social factors should not be thought of as individual factors, but thought of collectively,” she said, pointing to housing quality as a predictor of children’s development and behavior in school.

In addition, factors that contribute to housing quality and health quality, such as ventilation, plumbing, air quality, and water quality, have become even more significant with people sheltering in place during the outbreak, Sandel noted. “Our homes are not necessarily designed to be occupied 24 hours a day [in terms of infrastructure stresses], so we need to be thoughtful about designing housing in the future that will be more resilient,” she said.

Sandel noted that while the homeless population is the most visible evidence of the nation’s affordable housing shortage, a less visible segment, the “housing insecure” population—associated with multiple moves, living in overcrowded conditions, and falling behind on rent payments—is also attributable to unaffordable housing. Research prepared by Children’s HealthWatch shows that factors associated with housing insecurity, including falling behind on rent, can be as detrimental to children’s health as having no housing, she said.

“In the COVID era, millions more families will be behind on rent, and they could suffer from the same adverse health outcomes that we typically associate with homelessness,” said Sandel.

She noted that the virus pandemic has undermined the factors that comprise well-being, which include having social connections, feeling safe, feeling stable, feeling in control of one’s environment, and having meaningful access to resources. Housing stability, a powerful contributor to well-being, must become more broadly accessible to increase social equity in urban areas, Sandel said. “Housing acts as a vaccine to provide equity, and it is only through equity that we all get the same fair shot [at well-being].”

Doug Bibby, president of the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), discussed provisions in the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act related to the multifamily industry. The act provides benefits to renters suffering economic hardships due to the coronavirus, including cash payments to qualifying households and eviction moratoriums, and it provides apartment owners with some mortgage forbearance.

Though there was broad understanding during legislation deliberations of the dire need to keep renters from losing their housing, Bibby said, less well understood was the harmful multiplier effect that cascades throughout the apartment industry when renters are unable to pay rent over a sustained period.

According to Bibby, about 45 percent of U.S. rental units are owned by companies, including small businesses and pension funds representing moderate-income workers such as teachers and other service employees. Because the livelihood of smaller apartment owners and the retirement savings of pension fund participants depend on timely rental payments, both groups could be adversely affected by a large drop in rent payments, he said.

As a result, when eviction moratoriums were being added to the CARES Act, the apartment industry urged the inclusion of mortgage forbearance for apartment owners.

“Without provisions for forbearance, apartment owners could not sustain months of lower payments and would almost certainly would have to cut staff and services,” adding a new layer of difficulty in keeping buildings clean and sanitized for occupant safety, he said. While CARES did include forbearance, the timing does not align with the eviction moratoriums and needs to be adjusted in the next phase of federal support, Bibby added.

For the immediate term, NMHC has recommended to its members that they contact each resident in their apartment communities and work with those negatively affected by the coronavirus on alternative pricing strategies. “Our message is, work with residents any way you can,” Bibby said.

Strategies now in place include a rent relief fund started by one member, a rent reduction program started by another, and several flexible payment plans. NMHC plans to use data from a new survey on rent collections reflecting the impact of the virus to help inform subsequent economic relief/stimulus legislation, he said.

In addition to a modification of the multifamily mortgage forbearance and eviction moratorium provisions, NMHC will advocate for an emergency housing assistance fund for renter households; expansion of the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program to include multifamily businesses; enactment of the Multifamily Depreciation Parity Act; and infrastructure investment packages that promote affordable housing construction and rehabilitation.

Diane Yentel, president and chief executive officer of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), described how the nation’s homelessness crisis and the coronavirus crisis are exacerbating each other, with the homeless population being at extreme risk for contracting and spreading the virus, and with the financial ruin attributable to the virus adding to the already rising numbers of homeless people and those at risk of being homeless.

Before the outbreak, Yentel said, about 8 million people in the United States were not yet homeless but were considered severely cost burdened (paying 50 percent or more of their incomes for housing), often doubling up and tripling up with other households. “With such limited income, you have no cushion to absorb a financial shock, and the coronavirus is definitely a financial shock,” she said. Given the soaring job losses among the lowest-wage workers caused by virus-related business closures, NLIHC is predicting an increase of 1.5 million severely cost-burdened renters.

“Because we [as a nation] have not addressed housing shortages and the reality of homelessness for so many years, we now face these chilling scenarios in which people who are sleeping in homeless encampments and have no access to water or soap are facing a pandemic. We have to consider what happens when we have millions of people who, on a good day, are on the cusp of losing their homes [are] in the middle of a pandemic when our collective health depends on our ability to stay home,” Yentel said. “What the coronavirus has shown in a profound way is that housing is health care. We will not contain the pandemic until every one of us is able to isolate.”

She pointed out that deaths caused by the virus are disproportionately high among lower-income people of color, particularly African Americans. “The underlying health conditions that put people at risk of getting sick or dying of the virus, such as heart ailments, diabetes, and asthma, are the same conditions that come from living in poverty,” Yentel said.

As a result, it is important that federal economic relief efforts for renters affected by the virus include provisions to protect and house people who are homeless, prevent more people from becoming homeless, and preserve the limited affordable housing that exists in the United States, she said.

NLIHC advocated for the CARES Act to include significant funding for homeless outreach workers and shelter providers through an Emergency Solutions Grants program that will help secure housing for homeless people during the pandemic and reduce crowding in shelters. In addition, NLIHC advocated for additional Community Development Block Grant funding that communities can use for emergency rental assistance, as well as additional funding for subsidized housing programs to help offset the lost income from rental payments.

Yentel noted that the NLIHC is seeking the inclusion of a national eviction moratorium in the subsequent federal aid package to replace the numerous eviction moratoriums now in place at the federal, state, and local levels; and it is seeking a major emergency rental assistance program to help low-income renters pay back rent owed, as well as smaller landlords who rely on rental income to maintain and operate affordable units.

“We don’t want to end this crisis by losing some of the important affordable housing infrastructure in this country,” she said. Getting and keeping people off the streets and protected from the virus is critical to protecting “families, cities, the whole country,” Yentel said. “We all have a stake in getting this right.”

The coronavirus webinar series is being provided by ULI’s Building Healthy Places Initiative, created in 2013 to leverage the power of ULI’s global networks to shape projects and places in ways that improve the health of people and communities. The goal of the series is to help members understand the role they can play in helping slow the spread of the disease, help them navigate the long- and short-term impacts of the crisis, and help them understand how they can play a role in minimizing adverse impacts on vulnerable people.

Papa & Barkley’s Affordable Tinctures

Papa & Barkley launched Micro Dose Tinctures, a more affordable whole plant tincture priced at 9 cents per mg of cannabinoids.

The Micro Dose tinctures have 25% more milligrams of cannabinoids per dose than industry averages, the company claims.

""We are under a tremendous amount of pressure, physically, emotionally and financially. Families are choosing between basic needs and medicine. Launching our most affordable line of whole plant tinctures is one of the ways we are being supportive of our community; a way to provide clean, safe and affordable access to plant medicine that is needed, especially during these stressful times,” Angela Pih, Chief Marketing Officer told Benzinga.

Cresco Labs’ Value Brand

Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) launched High Supply, a value brand packaged without strain specificity and backed by the same quality standards as other Cresco Labs products.

According to the company, this new brand is for experienced cannabis consumers who know exactly what good cannabis is and what they want to pay for for it. It offers multiple forms of cannabis products, such as shorties, pre-rolls and vape pens, within a single brand.

“High Supply expands the Cresco Labs’ brand portfolio into a critical growth market segment, complementing the positioning of our current brands while delivering the same consistent scale and quality to a value consumer. We’re especially thrilled to accelerate the launch of this brand in California, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers and our retailer partners are looking for affordable quality more than ever,” said Cory Rothschild, SVP of Brand Marketing at Cresco Labs.

Guwahati: In an attempt to safeguard healthcare workers and citizens from coronavirus, a team of researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati have developed an affordable antimicrobial spray-based coating for PPE kits to kill and prevent the spread of microbes once they come in contact with the coated PPE surface. They have also developed 3D printed ear guard for the comfortable use of face masks by healthcare workers, said IIT Guwahati in a statement.

In a press release, IIT Guwahati said that the concepts were developed by Dr Biman B. Mandal, Professor, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT Guwahati, along with his Ph.D. scholars, Bibhas K. Bhunia and Ashutosh Bandyopadhyay.

Talking about the work, Dr. Biman B. Mandal, Professor, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT Guwahati, said, “Effective yet affordable technologies are need of the hour for India. We at IIT-G under the leadership of our Director, Prof. T.G. Sitharam, are committed to contribute to the nation’s immediate need at this hour of COVID-19 crisis.”

PPEs that are being used presently are designed to protect the wearer from infectious microbes/aqueous virus droplets acting as a barrier.

However, these PPE, generally, do not have the ability to prevent the spread of microbes as the surface of the fabric readily allows adherence and accumulation of microbes with time. This leads to further spread of the microbes due to the negligent handling of PPE and wrong disposal protocols, said IIT Guwahati.

The strategic association of metal nanoparticle cocktail, such as copper, silver and other active ingredients, present in the spray acts as an antimicrobial agent.

This ensures limited penetration and accumulation of microbial contaminants on PPE. Thus, the coating has the potential to reduce the risk of secondary infection by limiting the transmission of the microbes.

The Multi-Hopper Cart (MHC) from Conair features up to four dependable mass-flow hoppers mounted on a lightweight yet durable caster-mounted pushcart. The cart measures 35 inches deep, saving valuable floor space and making it easy to maneuver down narrow aisles and through doorways. Material can be dried off-line and wheeled to where it is needed, or the MHC can be stationed remotely to simultaneously supply material to multiple machines.

Seven different hopper sizes are available, ranging from 0.5-ft3 volume and a nominal capacity of 18 lb to 6 ft3 volume and 201-lb capacity. Image courtesy Conair.

Two basic configurations are available. The simplest has hoppers only with an insulated integral welded manifold system for supply and return of dehumidified air from a central dryer. It can also heat the material for smaller applications. For larger throughputs or applications that require higher temperatures, the cart can be wired for power with individual heaters added to each hopper. This allows several convenient features, including the ability to dry at different temperatures in each hopper, temperature setback to prevent over drying, and dewpoint monitoring and control. It can also be integrated into Conair’s SmartServices central monitoring and control platform, providing real-time alarm displays, a key performance indicator dashboard, machine view with real-time readouts of setpoint and actual temperatures, as well as condition indicator lights. The system can also display trend lines for key measurements in real time.

Seven different hopper sizes are available, ranging from 0.5-ft3 volume and a nominal capacity of 18 lb to 6 ft3 volume and 201-lb capacity. Carts are built in two sizes: A large version can accommodate up to four hoppers (depending on hopper size) and a smaller cart can be mounted with up to three hoppers (again, depending on size). A slide-gate discharge port prevents material leakage but facilitates easy hopper draining.

Available in carbon or stainless steel, all hoppers are fully insulated from top to bottom in order to preserve heat and save energy. All are designed for easy cleaning with a large clean-out door (with sight glass) and a removable air-diffuser cone. The mass-flow hopper design ensures that all material is evenly exposed to dry air and heat. Funnel flow and material hang ups are eliminated for superior drying. Each hopper is equipped with an isolation valve so that it can be taken off-line without disrupting operation of the other drying hoppers.","The Multi-Hopper Cart (MHC) from Conair features up to four dependable mass-flow hoppers mounted on a lightweight yet durable caster-mounted pushcart.

Sony’s introducing a duo of new headphones: the WF-XB700 true wireless earbuds and the WH-CH710N over-ear.

These aren’t new flagships replacing the WF-1000XM3 true wireless earbuds and the acclaimed WH-100XM3 over-ear headphones, and will, in fact, be a bit more affordable at $129.99 and $199.99 respectively. Both are up for preorder right now and will ship this month. Let’s dive into what’s new and what has us excited.

WF-XB700 True Wireless Earbuds

SONY

At just shy of $130, the WF-XB700 are cheaper than Sony’s best-in-class WF-1000XM3. But these don’t pack in all the features. Notably, there’s no active noise cancellation found on these. You might get a bit of passive noise cancellation, though, since these sit in-ear and likely make a solid seal. We’re looking forward to testing these for sound quality and to see just how much noise makes it in.

The XB700s get Sony’s Extra Bass technology, which is designed to boost bass and low tones. It should be a crisp and clean experience with those tones, and it should keep vocals just as clear and vibrant, adding up to a well-balanced experience. Powering the whole audio experience will be a 12mm Neodymium driver.

Unlike AirPods or Powerbeats, these won’t have fast pairing with iOS or macOS devices. With Bluetooth inside, this will be a standard pairing experience. Like all true wireless earbuds, these live in a case that doubles as a charger. You’ll get 18 hours of battery life in total, according to Sony, with nine hours on the buds and nine from the case. Charging for 10 minutes should get you 60 minutes of playback as well.

These seem to have a pretty similar design to the WF-1000XM3, with the ear tips resting tightly in your ears and the buds sticking out a bit or resting flush with your ear. The buds use Sony’s Tri-hold structure, which gives the earbuds three points of contact so they don’t fall out. Additionally, the WF-XB700s have an IPX4 rating, which means they’re good for splashes of water and sweat, so they should be a solid option for workouts.

WH-CH710N Over-Ear ANC Headphones

SONY

Color us intrigued, but the WH-CH710N has us quite excited. For $199.99, you’re getting a pair of over-ear cans with active noise cancellation and up to 35 hours of battery life.

The cans have artificial intelligence noise cancellation, which will analyze the space you’re in to select the proper level of noise cancellation. There are dual microphones on the WH-CH710N as well, which allow them to listen in front and behind you. For instance, on a plane seated near the engines, AINC might increase the level, but if you’re using them at a library, it might lower the level. Pretty cool, and similar to what we saw on WH-100XM3 from Sony and 700s from Bose. There’s also an ambient sound mode which will pump select environmental sounds in.

On the audio side, these should push out some terrific sound with 30mm drivers inside. It should be a well-balanced experience that doesn’t shy away from impressive low and high tones. Since these are over-ear headphones, you’ll be able to adjust them to your liking. After all, not all heads are the same size. There are metal sliders that will give you some room for adjustments. From the photos, the earcups look ample in size and should fit most ears.

On the battery side, you’ll likely get up to 35 hours of playback, which is pretty impressive. There’s a lithium-ion battery inside the WH-CH710N and it supports quick charging. Ten minutes of charging will get you an hour of playback. These charge with a USB Type-C port and cable as well.

The last feature that caught our attention is near-field communications. NFC is the same technology that powers Apple Pay and other contactless payment solutions. Sony is using it here for fast pairing and music playback with just a tap. You’ll simply tap an NFC-enabled device to the WH-CH710N and it will establish a connection. This won’t work on the iPhone since the NFC connection isn’t always casting, but this should work on Android devices.

Let’s recap

Sony’s new true wireless earbuds and over-ear AINC headphones are up for preorder Wednesday and will ship this month. The true wireless WF-XB700 are available in black or blue for $129.99. The over-ear WH-CH710N only come in black and cost $199.99. And if you want to go high-end, Sony’s WH-100XM3 are available now for $349.99, along with the WF-1000XM3 for $229.99. We will start hands-on testing soon, so stay tuned for a full review on CNN Underscored.

Toussaint and other College Park parents recently created a petition calling for the university to make a childcare center opening near campus more affordable. (Photo courtesy of Ebony Toussaint)

Elizabeth Massey, a musicology doctoral student at the University of Maryland, is all too familiar with just how hard it is to track down affordable childcare options in College Park.

A few months after her daughter was born in March 2018, she started looking into daycare facilities in the area, cramming the research — as well as grading and answering emails for her assistantship — into nap times. Then, a month before the fall semester began, she got the call: there was an opening at a center in Hyattsville.

“They said, ‘Okay, you’re the 12th person that we’ve called today and whoever gets us the money first gets the spot,” Massey recalled. “So I got in the car immediately.”

That year, Massey and her husband paid $1,440 per month for their daughter to attend the Loving 2 Learn Child Care Center — a cost, while being on the cheaper end in the area, still consumed almost all of what Massey made each month as a teaching assistant in the university’s music school.

So, when she heard that the university was opening a child development center in the area, she was excited, expecting the daycare to offer a lower rate to Maryland community members. Then she caught wind of its monthly tuition: ranging from $1,360 for preschool and $1,925 for infant and toddler care with no discount for university staff, faculty or students.

“That’s, like, super expensive, no matter what you’re making out here, honestly,” she said with a laugh. “I mean, it’s exorbitant compared to other places around here.”

This hefty price tag flabbergasted some at the university, where graduate students on 9½-month assistantships can earn as little as $18,791 per year — which comes to around $1,978 per month. Frustrated by the lofty rate, a group of parents mobilized to create a petition calling for the university to make the center more affordable. As of Tuesday evening, it had 359 signatures.

[Read more: A new preschool is set to open in College Park next year]

The petition criticizes the university for choosing such an expensive childcare provider and for not offering discounts to faculty, staff or students — especially after it invested millions to help the city of College Park renovate the former school building on Calvert Road that is set to house the University of Maryland Child Development Center.

In an emailed statement, Bright Horizons Family Solutions — the childcare provider selected by the university — praised the services set to be offered by the center.

“The program is focused on providing the highest quality early education, with the teaching team nurturing each child’s curiosity through thoughtful, age-appropriate experiences through intentional guidance and rich experiences that move children along their journeys by building on individual strengths and talents,” wrote Stacy Ginsberg, the company’s regional manager.

A university spokesperson deferred to the Bright Horizons statement for comment.

Ginsberg added that the center’s tuition fell in line with other childcare centers in the area. However, the rate at the soon-to-open Monarch Preschool nearby is more than $100 lower than what the center plans to charge for preschool.

The parents behind the petition also brainstormed 12 measures the university could take to make the center more affordable for campus community members, such as offering an income-dependent child care subsidy or allocating a number of spots with enrollment priority to low income faculty, staff and students.

Taking these steps would allow a diverse range of individuals to take advantage of the center, and could even welcome a more diverse student body to campus, said Alexandra Tyukavina, an assistant research professor in the geographical sciences department who helped create the petition.

“It’s going to be a nice space for kids, and why can’t it be accessible?” she asked. “I mean, I’m not saying make it free or something, but at least reflect the median prices for P.G. County.”

Ever since Tyukavina became pregnant in 2018, she’s been following the facility’s renovation, and even attended an information session for the center with her husband and 11-month-old daughter earlier this month.

When a Bright Horizons representative revealed what the center’s tuition would be at the end of the session, Tyukavina was shocked — even though she and her husband would be able to afford the cost now, she said that wouldn’t have been the case when she was a doctoral or postdoctoral student at the university.

“We chose to live in College Park, hoping that this area is going to improve for people like us, who want to live closer to where they work, and help this area thrive,” she said.

Vexed by the high tuition, Tyukavina wrote up an open letter to university officials and the College Park mayor and shared it on a local parenting listserv. Immediately, she said, she started hearing from folks with similar concerns — parents who shared stories of struggling to afford childcare in the area. Wanting to take further action, Tyukavina pulled together their feedback and set about drafting the petition.

Along the way, she was joined by a handful of other parents, who helped brainstorm and tweak the petition’s language.

Ebony Toussaint, a health policy and management doctoral student and mom of two, got involved after hearing what the center was set to cost parents — news that came as a real disappointment because she had originally been cheered that the university was opening a childcare center.

“I was like, ‘Wow, this is great! You know, academics, we just get the job done,’” she said. “They’re gonna make sure this place [has a] great curriculum, it’s gonna be clean . . . they’re gonna make sure this is equitable, this is going to be evidence-driven — the best childcare anyone’s ever seen!”

[Read more: Community members welcome upcoming childcare center — but some have cost concerns]

Now, Toussaint is hoping the petition will spur the university to have a discussion about childcare costs and equity.

But Tyukavina knows she and other parents will have to act quickly if they want things to change at the center, which is planned to open this summer. Since the demand for childcare in the area is so high, she expects that the 120 spots offered by the center will quickly be filled by the kids of parents who can afford its cost.

Originally, Tyukavina was planning to share the petition with incoming university president Darryll Pines at a listening session he was scheduled to host in April. But with the novel coronavirus ripping through the country, Pines has put the planned listening sessions on pause.

Now, Tyukavina hopes to share the petition on the website Pines’ transition team is using to collect feedback from the campus community and circulate it over email to university and city officials. She’s planning to email them every week until she receives a response — then, she says it’ll be up to them to form a workgroup to tackle the issue.

Working on this petition has been important to Tyukavina. It allows her to take a bunch of mental and emotional energy she had previously been expelling on frustration and channel it toward a constructive goal. Not only that, but it has also given her a sense of purpose in an uncertain and frightening time.

“I think at some point, for me, it’s like a coping mechanism [for] all the anxiety that surrounds me,” she said. “At least doing something that potentially, hopefully benefits someone other than me in this kind of scary situation that we’re in.”","Ebony Toussaint, a public health doctoral student at the University of Maryland, stands with her husband and two sons.

This is leading to a jump in shortages of affordable sanitary napkins across the country, forcing many women to adopt unhygienic methods of managing their monthly period.

Affordable sanitary pads are largely made by the informal sector units that are run with a few workers, mostly women, with the support of non-governmental organisations. Some of these units are in urban areas while a large number of them are in rural areas. The Union government had declared sanitary pads as essential goods, along with groceries, but those operating the units said that the government’s order does not help them run their units.

Arunachalam Muruganantham, popularly known as Padman, told BusinessLine that his factories in Coimbatore that manufacture the machinery for making affordable pads as also units that process raw materials for the pads are idling due to the lockdown. He has also not been able to get imported raw materials used in making the sanitary pads released from the Chennai port. “The material is sitting in containers at the port and I am paying large amount as demurrage charges on it,” he said.

The imported raw materials are processed at his unit and sent to thousands of small units across the country to make the sanitary pads.

He complained that he has not been able to send mechanics to any units where the machinery needs repairs.

Pratibha Singh, who runs an NGO in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh, said that her unit was running out of raw materials. Her NGO, Kshitij Education and Rural Development, has two pad making machines that Muruganantham had invented, and was due to get a quarterly supply of raw materials from his factories late March. With the lockdown being imposed, she has not got the supply. She is not keen to source the raw materials from other suppliers, as they do not offer the same quality of cotton filling. “I am exploring if my unit can make reusable cloth pads made of cotton fabrics, and thus give women a hygienic option, till normal operation is restored,” said Singh.

“There is a lot of demand for affordable pads. I have received a few enquiries,” says Deepali Bhardwaj, a practising dermatologist. An NGO run by her with family and friends, Deepanjan Charitable Trust, has installed pad making machines invented by Muruganantham in Delhi and Dehradun. The Delhi unit continues to operate, with one person, who stays at the premises. The Dehradun unit has been idling since the lockdown was imposed. Dr Bhardwaj’s NGO has been distributing pads for free to needy women and also supplying it at cost to those seeking to buy in bulk.

All of them fear that if the governments at the centre and states do not act urgently to restore normal production of affordable sanitary napkins, the gains made over the last decade in improving menstrual hygiene may be reversed. Mr Muruganantham wants the government to allow normal operations of the units making these sanitary pads, while observing social distancing norms as well as the unfettered distribution of the pads. Most of these units and distribution of the pads are done by women, who are organised as self-help groups. A return to normalcy is also important to restore the livelihood of these women, Singh added.","Affordable sanitary pads are largely made by the informal sector units that are run with a few workers, mostly women, with the support of non-governmental organisations.
He has also not been able to get imported raw materials used in making the sanitary pads released from the Chennai port.
The imported raw materials are processed at his unit and sent to thousands of small units across the country to make the sanitary pads.
“There is a lot of demand for affordable pads.

The Scottish Government is set to miss its target to build 50,000 affordable homes by 2021 amid the coronavirus outbreak.

In a Scottish parliamentary written answer Kevin Stewart, Minister for housing stated that due to the ‘effective lock down’ it is necessary to have a ‘pause in the delivery of affordable homes.’

And fuel poverty targets and energy efficiency measures are also set to be missed.

The Scottish Conservatives have stated that, even without the impact of COVID-19, the SNP government was on course to miss its affordable homes target of 50,000 houses by May 2021.

Central Scotland Tory MSP and shadow housing and communities secretary said this will “hit the most vulnerable hardest.”

He said: “This is understandably frustrating, but the fight against COVID-19 is affecting every part of Scottish life – it is right we put people first and do everything possible to stop the spread of this.

“However, the SNP was already on course to miss the affordable homes target by some margin.”

Latest figures show that between April 2016 and December 2019 31,000 homes had been completed, with 9000 new homes set to be completed in Scotland per year.

Linda Fabiani called Mr Simpson’s comments a “cheap shot” that overlooked the government was “on course” to meet their 50,000 affordable homes commitment.

The East Kilbride MSP added: “Of course it’s disappointing that the target won’t be met now construction has been stopped.

“But the health of the nations is the priority of the Scottish Government - I would have thought it should be Mr Simpson’s priority too.”

Sally Thomas, chief executive of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the organisations “supports” the government’s decision to pause builds.

She added: “Our members have worked hard to help the Scottish Government to meet its affordable homes target, and they will do so again once it is safe to re-start construction.”","Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy noticeThe Scottish Government is set to miss its target to build 50,000 affordable homes by 2021 amid the coronavirus outbreak.

With its picturesque canals, Golden Age architecture, rich cultural offerings, and a freewheeling spirit, Amsterdam is a top destination for all types of travelers.

Amsterdam is also quite expensive, with many four-star and up hotels starting at around $400 or $500 most times of the year.

However, some hidden gem hotels are priced more affordably, with e ntry-level rooms starting as low as $76 per night, rising to $295 for ritzier stays. We selected the best affordable hotels based on our experience staying at centrally-located properties, as well as reviews and rankings from trusted traveler sites.

A note from your Insider Reviews travel editor: Coronavirus has interrupted travel on a global scale forcing travelers to cancel and reassess plans in the coming weeks and months. We understand that right now is a challenging time to plan travel. But when this time passes and things return to normal, we know you'll be eager to explore the world again.

Whenever that happens for you, and we know it will, we hope our travel content helps you make informed, useful, and inspiring choices on the best places and hotels to book. So whether you use our reviews now, bookmark them for the future, or simply need an escape from the news, we'll continue to share the world with you. In the meantime, we encourage all travelers to stay safe, follow guidelines from the CDC website, and take precautions.

With its latticework of canals, quaint cobblestone streets, and Golden Age gabled houses, Amsterdam ranks as one of the world's most picturesque capitals. Its compact city center seems designed with Instagram in mind, and every turn reveals another arched bridge, scenic waterway, or atmospheric cobbled lane — and, of course, there's all those tall, good-looking Dutch cyclists, too.

As such, Amsterdam has become a popular year-round destination, especially in late spring, summer, and early fall, when the weather is nicest. Consequently, those seasons see the highest hotel rates. If you're looking for a bargain — and don't mind the damp winter weather — consider visiting from November to March (though keep in mind the Dutch also celebrate the Christmas holiday in early December). Strategic timing will certainly help as Amsterdam's hotels have some of the continent's highest occupancy rates and highest prices, with an average nightly rate of 167 euro (about $185), and centrally-located four- and five-star properties commanding several hundred dollars per night.

While the historic central Canal District is the most coveted, many other neighborhoods offer their own distinct charms. Hip, happening De Pijp and Westerpark, the art-filled Museum Quarter, edgy, industrial Amsterdam Noord (North), and the multi-cultural Amsterdam Oost (East) are all worth a look — especially considering the city is well-connected by a network of trams and the Metro. In these areas, you'll find a mix of mainly three- and four-star properties at much friendlier price points.

Expect rooms of all sizes and shapes, from raw concrete spaces to those rich with period details, and decor that ranges from sleekly minimalist to retro-hip to seriously sumptuous.

Being mindful of budget, our picks range from $76 to $295 per night in low season. All selections are rated three-star or higher, based on my own personal experience at every hotel, and also incorporate feedback from trusted traveler sites such as Trip Advisor and Booking.com.

Several hotels are found in prime locations, but given Amsterdam's high nightly rates, some are situated in outlying neighborhoods that are nevertheless well-connected to the city center. I also looked for key amenities such as a unique design sensibility, interesting surroundings, a buzzy in-house restaurant or bar scene, and other perks guests love.

101,https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/04/17/wyze-lock-review/,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Android Police,"Wyze Lock review: Affordable, robust smart upgrade for your existing locks","Installing a houseful of smart home upgrades gets expensive fast, which is why we're always excited when budget-conscious Wyze releases a new device. From internet-connected cameras, to security sensors, to smart outlets and even lightbulbs, Wyze has managed to prove itself in new product categories time and time again (well, with the occasional hiccup along the way). Now it's tackling the smart lock market, with the release of the aptly named Wyze Lock. How will it compare to more expensive solutions? Let's take a look.

The Good Installation Not only super-easy, but also very renter-friendly, letting you keep the original lock hardware in place. Design Clean, utilitarian look with some clever functional elements. Pricing Even with the cost eventually rising from $89 to $99 (though orders can currently grab the lower price) this is a very affordable way to smarten up your locks. Features Wyze offers some decent functionality, from sharing access to setting up automatic operation, and it's all simple to configure.

The Not So Good Keypad I don't love treating the Keypad as optional, especially with the sort of auto-lock features we have here. I'm also not a huge fan of its design, and we still don't know anything about pricing. Occasional glitches Wyze devices can sometimes get a little wonky, and I did run into a few problems here, like when the door sensor lost calibration and thought it was always open, or when the Lock Gateway just stopped connecting. These were all quickly resolved, but this being a smart lock, still make me anxious. Battery life I feel like this may be tied to those door-sensor glitches, but battery life has been appalling. After just two months of operation, the four AA batteries are down to just 7% charge.

Design, hardware, what's in the box

There are a lot of different ways to build a smart lock, and the biggest question seems to be ""how much of your old lock do you want to keep?"" On one end of the spectrum you've got devices like the Nuki that keep your existing lock 100% intact, and just connect to it externally. At the other extreme is something like the Schlage Encode, that fully replace your old lock hardware.

Wyze's solution is somewhere in the middle: You keep your exterior hardware, and you can keep using your same key, but the Wyze Lock replaces your deadbolt's interior thumb-turn latch.

The Lock itself has a solid metal body, with prominent thumb-latch of its own. A magnetic face panel conceals the 4AA batteries powering the unit, and easily pops off to access them. There's not much mounting hardware, but everything you need is here, including a rear bracket, three adapters to connect the Wyze Lock to you existing lock's internal workings, and even a helpful piece of tape to hold your old lock in place during installation.

In addition to all that, there's also the Wyze Lock Gateway, the hub that connects the Lock itself to the rest of your network.

Find somewhere near your Wyze Lock to install its Gateway and get the smart lock online.

Setup and installation

Getting started with the Wyze Lock is incredibly straightforward. To begin, you just unscrew the interior side of your existing deadbolt (using that tape I just mentioned to keep the exterior bit secure). Then using those very same screws you mount the adjustable rear plate, keeping the ""up"" arrow ... well, you can guess where it should be pointing.

The app then talks you through identifying which of the colored adapters you're going to need to interface your lock hardware with Wyze's. This could easily be the most intimidating part of setup, but a well-done guide with lots of useful images helps walk you through it painlessly.

This bracket screws in place of your old thumb-turn; a set of adapters help the Wyze Lock work with your existing hardware.

With that in place, you can screw the Wyze Lock body to the plate, and you're pretty much done on the hardware side. The app will talk you through connecting to the Gateway and your WiFi, as well as the process for calibrating the Lock's sensors, which let it detect when the door is open and closed.

Optionally, you can also install the Wyze Lock Keypad — or at least you will be able to, once it becomes available this May. The Keypad is powered by two AA batteries and mounts wherever you like with its included bracket. It offers one-touch locking, an LED backlight, and supports 4-8 digit codes. I just wish it were the more familiar three-column design, rather than the two we get, and that the whole unit were a bit thinner.

Software and functionality

Once all set up, the Wyze Lock appears in the Wyze app alongside your cameras, outlets, and the rest of the company's gear. The main view gives you a quick lock/unlocked indication, and tapping through pulls your main Lock interface with lock/unlock toggle, door-open status, and a log of recent Lock events.

Main lock interface; configuring options; setting auto-lock delay.

In addition to manually locking and unlocking your door through that screen, the app also offers a couple optional automatic options. Auto-lock detects when the door's been closed and, well, you can guess the rest. This can be configured to happen immediately, or on a time delay of up to an hour. The feature works well, although the ""lock at once"" option can be a little aggressive if you're closing the door too slowly. But honestly, I've been locked out without my phone too many times to trust myself using this at all.

There's also an auto-unlock mode that uses geofencing to sense when you come home. This one's been a little hit-and-miss for me, sometimes failing to unlock on my return. But at least since its operation requires having your phone on you, you can always just unlock manually with the app.

Defining guest code restrictions; choosing alarm options; configuring notifications

To stay on top of what's going on with your Wyze Lock, the app offers both lock and unlock notifications, and there are optional alarms for things like leaving the door wide open for an extended period — some nice bonuses.

As we'd only expect from a smart lock, you can share access to the Wyze Lock with other people. The primary way of doing that is through the app: you enter someone's email, they'll get an invite, and then be able to control your Lock through the Wyze app on their own phone.

If you happen to pick up the Wyze Lock Keypad (when that comes out), you also have the option to just assign codes to your guests. These can be permanent, one-time-use, or operate on whatever schedule you'd like.

On the surface, everything seems fine about what the Wyze Lock is doing, but I've noticed a thread of unexpected behavior that's sort of undercutting my confidence in the product, and preventing it from getting a higher score. First has been inconsistent behavior from the door-closed sensor. While I've been able to calibrate the sensor and use it initially, after a week or so it starts thinking the door's constantly ajar. Recalibrating fixes this, but the issue has recurred multiple times.

That alone is more of an annoyance than a deal-breaker, but I worry that it's driving a separate, larger issue: the battery life I've observed from the Wyze Lock is far from what was promised.

Wyze claims users should see 5-6 months of operation on a set of 4 AA batteries. I'm about halfway through that timeframe, and my batteries are at 7% currently. This is especially surprising because I've been using a Schlage Encode for a bit longer than the Wyze Lock, which also uses 4 AA batteries, but connects to WiFi directly, rather than with an external hub like Wyze. So while the Schlage lock should be eating a lot more power, its batteries are still at 41%. There's just no good reason the Wyze Lock should be using this much power. I'm hopeful that if a software update eventually solves that door-sensor issue, perhaps battery life will also improve.

Should you buy it?

Wyze Lock 7 / 10

Sure. From the feature set, to the hardware design, to a very attractive price tag, there's really a lot to like about the Wyze Lock. This could have been a real bare-bones model, but Wyze really stepped up with little extras — like I was out the other night and realized I forgot to lock my door, but thanks to the Lock's position-detection and the app's logging, I could see that no one had even tried to open it, giving me some extra peace of mind.

I really wish the Keypad didn't feel like such an afterthought, and I'm concerned about software stability and the consequence that threatens to have on what's proving to be questionable battery life. Even with those issues, this is generally a well-thought-out, largely well-executed, and ultimately great value in a smart lock.","Now it's tackling the smart lock market, with the release of the aptly named Wyze Lock.

The A&norma SR25 replaces 2018's SR15 as the luxury brand's entry-level digital audio player. But ""entry level"" still means you'll be spending over half a grand to experience the device's promised bit-perfect playback. That said, though the asking price of US$699 may seem pretty steep to many of us, it's a fraction of the ticket price for the company's flagship A&ultima SP2000.

The SR25 retains the angular Astell&Kern design language Astell&Kern

Astell&Kern says that the SR25 is the first entry-level player in its line to support native DSD256 and 32-bit/384-kHz PCM format playback, it's also the first to support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, and it has the longest battery life of the current batch for up to 21 hours of continuous listening. The firmware running on the portable music machine is based on Android 9.0, and the 3.6-inch, 720 x 1,280 resolution TFT display panel is reported an improvement over what's come before.

At the heart of the device is a quad-core processor and dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs (digital-to-analog converters), with an Ultra Low Noise Filter for clean and clear output. There's a new Performance Mode for auto optimization of the system and memory to ensure that the processing of high resolution audio files are handled smoothly for ""near perfect sound quality.""

Unfortunately, not everyone is blessed with cooking genes and some of us are just culinarily-challenged.

Does the inability to cook mean going hungry if you want to strictly practise social distancing? Thankfully no, thanks to the delivery services that continue to bring delicious meals direct to our doorstep, with contactless options no less.

No matter what your food preferences are, the good news is that there are many affordable options available and here are some that you can go check out.

For those who like their good ol' hawker fare: WhyQ

Can't live without your weekly dose of chicken rice and char kway teow? Have no fear, WhyQ delivery service is dedicated exclusively to ensuring that Singapore residents get their favourite hawker dishes delivered to them, even during this circuit breaker.

While there are other services that deliver hawker food, what sets WhyQ apart is its low, fixed delivery fee of just $1.50 per meal ordered, with no minimum order. This is the lowest delivery fee in the market, perfect if you are ordering in for just one person.

The only catch is that your options are limited to food centres in your vicinity. This means that you won't be able to tuck into chicken rice from Maxwell Food Centre if you are staying at either end of the island. Still, if you have a favourite neighbourhood stall that you frequent, you can get your fix without stepping out of the house.

WhyQ in a nutshell: When you have hawker food cravings that the kitchen at home cannot satisfy.

For those who like home-cooked food sans the cooking at home: Tingkat

A popular option for working adults even before the circuit breaker, tingkat services provide three dishes and one soup, the quintessential Chinese family meal, delivered right to your doorstep.

This is perfect for those who like a variety of dishes when they eat. Some services even promise that you won't be delivered the same dish within the month and you can view the menu for the entire month before you place your order. Decide once, and you have your meals settled; no more pondering over what to eat for every meal.

The potential dealbreaker is that tingkat services usually require you to order for a minimum of two people and for a fixed, extended period.

If that sounds like too much of a commitment for a service that you aren't sure is suited to your tastes, trial packages of five days are available and there are even one-pax options. Of course, the per person price decreases when you order for more people or sign up for a longer package.

One point in favour of tingkat services is that it is the greener choice as food delivery tends to involve a lot of disposable containers and cutlery. Tingkat, on the other hand, can be delivered in metal tins that will be collected the next day when subsequent meals are sent. Do check with the company before you place your order if you are pro-environment.

Tingkat services in a nutshell: When you have to order meals for a group of people, want a variety of food and don't want to spend time choosing what to eat every day.

For those who want to eat clean: Nutrition Kitchen

Staying in usually means expending less energy, and it's simple math: the fewer calories you burn, the more likely that weight will pile on. Enter Nutrition Kitchen, whose meals are designed by personal trainers that break it down to the macronutrients you require.

Suitable for those who are watching their waistline or looking to bulk up, choose from four types of meals depending on your goal and commit to a package (minimum of five days with the option of two or three meals daily).

If you're worried that there might be something you won't enjoy, you can pick and choose from the available meals for the day, with menus available in five-week cycles. All your meals for the day get delivered to you before noon and there are no additional delivery charges.

Prices are on the higher side but comparable to having a salad in the CBD. The drawback is that each cycle starts on a Monday and you have to place your order by Friday 12pm the week before. You also can't choose to have your meals only on selected days; it has to be from Monday to Friday, and they don't deliver on weekends.

Nutrition Kitchen in a nutshell: When you like to know the breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in your meal, have a health goal you'll like to achieve or generally eat clean.

107,https://energynews.us/2020/05/27/virginia-agency-aims-to-make-solar-faster-easier-and-more-affordable/,"Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Energy News Network,"Virginia agency aims to make solar ‘faster, easier and more affordable’","The state’s Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy has launched a technical assistance program for solar projects.

Virginia will have to significantly boost solar energy production to meet a legislative mandate to decarbonize its electricity grid in the next 25 years.

That pressing timeline has prompted a state agency that oversees energy and mining development to help local governments knock down barriers to solar — which now provides just 1% of the state’s electricity.

Carrie Hearne will lead the new Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy solar technical assistance program that is linked with SolSmart, a federally funded, national program. She was hired last fall to fill a new position, solar manager, at the agency’s Division of Energy.

The goal is “to make solar development faster, easier and more affordable,” Hearne said about connecting with SolSmart. “That includes creating efficiencies within localities to reduce taxpayer spending that, in turn, reduces the soft costs for installing commercial and residential solar.”

Her role covers offering specific guidance on permitting, zoning, inspections, and code needs, as well as community and utility involvement.

The Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, or DMME, is one agency charged with meeting the goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law last month. The act requires Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility, to switch to renewables by 2045 and Appalachian Power to follow suit by 2050.

The far-reaching measure establishes aggressive energy efficiency standards, broadly expands incentives for rooftop solar, and kickstarts a massive offshore wind industry.

Initially, Hearne and others are focused on recruiting communities in the southern part of the state, where geography, policies, a history of relying on coal and other factors have combined to make the transition to renewable energy trickier — and slower.

Richmond, Roanoke, Charlottesville, Blacksburg, Norton and the Northern Virginia Regional Commission are among the 20 localities that earned SolSmart designation before DMME’s involvement.

Innovators such as Adam Wells said expanding that foundation is crucial to expanding solar access statewide. He is still a driving force with an organization he spearheaded four years ago — the Solar Workgroup of Southwest Virginia — that is navigating the complexities of incorporating renewable energy into an economic transition in the state’s seven coalfield counties. Six of those counties are enrolled in SolSmart.

DMME is a member of a coalition that includes nonprofits, community action agencies, colleges, state agencies and planning district commissions.

“The agency’s involvement with SolSmart matters and will make a big difference,” said Wells, regional director of community and economic development for the advocacy group Appalachian Voices. “Communities need special technical resources to make good decisions.

“Statewide, there has to be a technical adviser for SolSmart to work. It makes sense for that service to be centralized because of the need to sort through the interplay of local ordinances and state policies.”

Flagship university offers expertise

SolSmart, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, was launched in 2016 by The Solar Foundation and the International City/County Management Association.

The idea is to send a signal to developers that a community is open for solar business. Thus far, 350 municipalities nationwide have achieved SolSmart bronze, silver or gold status.

In Virginia, DMME will be drawing on technical expertise of the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.

William Shobe directs the Center for Economic and Policy Studies affiliated with Weldon Cooper.

“Our work with DMME and the Solar Foundation will help chart a fair and cost-effective path to a clean energy future,” Shobe said.

In her role with DMME, Hearne is also involved with the Clean Energy Advisory Board, created last year to figure out how to share Virginia’s wealth of solar power with the state’s poorer residents.

Its 15 members are tasked with establishing a solar financing program for households with low to moderate incomes. Hearne does not serve on the advisory board, but she co-led its first meeting in December. DMME Director John Warren is on the board.

“While there is not a direct connection between the Clean Energy Advisory Board and SolSmart,” Hearne said, SolSmart participants will benefit from lower costs as well as easier access and installation.

COVID-19 opens partnership opportunity

Wells referred to Hearne and Elizabeth Marshall, of the University of Virginia, as the “ideal project team” to be guiding the state’s solar trajectory.

Bizarrely enough, he said, that collaboration emerged as one of the few “happy outcomes” of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March, his solar workgroup’s progress on designing a plan for sharing technical expertise was waylaid by the coronavirus. That proposal was to be a linchpin of the solar playbook members were crafting with funding from a GO Virginia (growth and opportunity) state grant.

“With that delay, partnering with DMME and the University of Virginia became an option,” Wells said. “It makes sense because of the wealth of resources and extra capacity at the department with Carrie and her team.”

Hearne emphasized that her agency not only has a huge presence in southwest Virginia, with offices in Big Stone Gap and Lebanon, but also a trove of data about thousands of acres of previously mined land there.

In tandem with the workgroup, she wants to tailor SolSmart resources to support large-scale solar development on minelands.

Wells and his team have already pioneered one solution by writing a grant to tap into federal money that targets redevelopment on old mine sites. A yet-to-be-built 3.5-megawatt, ground-mounted array in Wise County will eventually power on-site data centers with a net metering system.

It’s the first such project in Central Appalachia and DMME funded it in 2019 with a $500,000 grant. Since 2016, various Appalachian states have been receiving federal money from the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program. Money comes from the U.S. Treasury.

Sun Tribe Solar in Charlottesville is handling Wise County installation. Taylor Brown, the company’s chief technical officer, said pairing state and national solar experts with local leaders who know their communities will lead to construction of more projects similar to Mineral Gap Data Centers.

“We’ve found a group of people who really understand that making the region a clean energy hub can help create jobs and attract new businesses to the area,” Taylor said about bonding with leaders and residents in southwest Virginia.

Until recently, the workgroup’s attempts to install more than 4 MW of commercial-scale solar across the region over the last several years have been stonewalled.

However, just this month members are seeing signs that several of their 18 initially proposed projects might see daylight soon. Some of that is due to higher ceilings on power purchase agreements spelled out in the Clean Energy Act and the Solar Freedom bill. Although both take effect July 1, utility regulators opted to open the cap in mid-May.

As well, Appalachian Power is encouraging project developers for schools and other government entities to submit PPA applications despite some related complications.

Wells is hopeful the SolSmart alliance with DMME and the university green-light solar across the spectrum.

While the economic and people potential of solar in the coalfields is enormous, the Wise County native’s caveat is that all players adhere to social justice principles.

That means energy developers must invest in the community rather than repeating the extractive methods and behavior of the fossil fuel era.

“We need to invest in the community,” Wells said about connecting solar to the local labor force, education and entrepreneurship. “If we’re going to be mining the sun’s rays and exploiting that wealth, we want to make sure there are long-term benefits.”","Virginia will have to significantly boost solar energy production to meet a legislative mandate to decarbonize its electricity grid in the next 25 years.

The Fritz Family Farms, LLC in New Windsor, Maryland recently partnered with Standard Solar, Inc., a leading solar energy company specializing in the development, funding and operations of solar electric systems nationwide, on a 2.7 megawatt (MW) solar array on 12 acres of their 400-acre grain, hay and cattle farm.

“This project provides economic benefit to the landowner, operator and community while harnessing clean renewable energy,” said Jeffrey Fritz, Fritz Family Farms, LLC. “We have been using our own solar energy in our operation since 2014 and felt this was an excellent opportunity to diversify our income.”

Standard Solar, teamed with a joint venture comprised of Earth and Air Technologies LLC and Ogos Energy LLC developed and built the single-axis tracking solar array that is configured for Maryland’s Virtual Aggregate Net Energy Metering (ANEM) program, facilitated through Maryland’s 2019 Clean Energy Jobs Act.

“This solar project is a win-win scenario for all—it is transforming a portion of low yield land into 20-year predictable revenue for a family-run farm while providing affordable, reliable power to the region’s public water authority,” said John Finnerty, Director of Business Development, Standard Solar. “It also highlights how smart solar project siting practices can benefit agriculture, complement farm operations and land use.”

Standard Solar financed and will own and operate the 7,336-panel high efficiency engineered project that is expected to produce approximately 4,000 MW hours (MWh) annually. The power will be purchased by WSSC Water, one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in the nation, contributing to its sustainability goals and adding value for their Maryland customers.

“Energy management is critical to WSSC Water,” said Robert Taylor, Energy Manager, WSSC Water. “Investing in solar energy pays dividends both economically and environmentally as it lowers our dependence on carbon-based fuels.”

WSSC Water has shared success with Standard Solar having worked together on more than 14 MW of solar PV now operational at their Western Branch Water Resource Recovery Facility in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, the Seneca Water Resource Recovery Facility in Germantown, Maryland and two additional off-site locations. Combined, the systems produce approximately 19,000 MWh of energy annually.

Image courtesy of Community Preservation Corp.

In the early 1970s, New York City was losing between 20,000 to 30,000 rental units each year in abandonment, fire or demolition. With a clear goal to address these issues, the Community Preservation Corp. was founded in 1974 and stands today as a Community Development Financial Institution solely committed to investing in multifamily housing. So far, the company has invested more than $11 billion to finance the creation and preservation of 196,000 units across New York State and beyond.

Earlier this year, CPC announced plans to attain carbon-neutral operations during the 2020 calendar year. The initiative is in line with New York’s goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. To find out what steps the company is taking to fulfill this commitment and to learn how this bodes with the company’s investment focus on affordable housing, Multi-Housing News talked to CPC Executive Vice President & Head of Construction Lending Sadie McKeown. She heads the company’s construction lending and sustainability initiatives and leads CPC’s “underwriting efficiency” practice that incorporates energy and water efficiency features into the financing of first mortgages for multifamily building owners.

CPC’s sustainability plan includes purchasing electricity from renewable sources. Where are you acquiring it from and to what extent do your operations rely on clean energy?

McKeown: Our ultimate goal is to minimize our overall footprint as much as possible, but there are necessary functions, like literally keeping the lights on, that still require energy consumption. For these, we are making every conscious choice possible to be responsible and sustainable consumers, like using renewable energy suppliers for our office electricity when we have the option to do so. For buildings that we can’t choose our own supplier and for additional necessary usages, CPC will be purchasing Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to offset the greenhouse gas emissions and our Scope 2 emissions.

Has the company implemented energy and water conservation measures?

McKeown: Our offices in New York City and Westchester County were retrofitted with low-flow water fixtures and motion- sensor LED lighting to reduce water and energy consumption. But installing hardware for energy and water conservation is just a start. We put a big focus on educating our staff around reduction strategies that are easy to adopt, and developed sustainability guidelines to engage employees around ways to reduce our total carbon footprint both at the office and in their own homes.

We believe buy-in from our staff will make the biggest impact on our everyday behaviors, which will, in turn, lower our collective output. We found that many on our teams had the intention to make conscious decisions and develop sustainable habits but didn’t know how to do it on their own, or maybe didn’t feel like their individual efforts were impactful. When the opportunities were encouraged and made accessible, our staff was very excited to contribute.

What waste reduction strategies are considered/implemented at the company’s offices?

McKeown: Sustainability best practices are a priority and part of the conversation for all company activities, events and procurement strategies. Our sustainability guidelines also help employees implement waste reduction and recycling. We added composting services at our New York City headquarters and are looking to roll out similar programs at other CPC offices. We have also introduced companywide efforts to reduce paper usage and hold centralized e-waste drives to help employees properly dispose of electronics.

Are the technologies you use or plan to use for your operations also suitable for your multifamily portfolio?

McKeown: As a company and tenant of a large property, we are taking very specific and intentional steps toward more sustainable practices. Although CPC-financed projects are not part of our company’s own carbon footprint, promoting energy efficiency is central to our mission and we actively work with our borrowers and partners to pursue energy conservation and low-carbon measures.

As a lender, we cannot impose specific practices on our borrowers, however, we encourage and help finance certain measures for new construction and retrofits that increase efficiency and sustainability. These are methods that borrowers can integrate into their buildings and major systems such as heating and cooling. Since 2013, when we started measuring specific sustainability metrics, CPC has financed nearly 7,000 units of environmentally sustainable housing, which maximizes the economic benefits of cost savings and efficiency. The sustainable projects that CPC finances reduce whole property annual energy and/or water usage by at least 20 percent.

How does the company ensure a low-carbon commute and how do you approach business travel?

McKeown: We track employee commuting and business travel to include in Scope 3 of our annual carbon footprint calculation. The vast majority of employees at CPC, about 80 percent, are based out of the New York City office and use public transportation to commute to and from work, which is considered a best practice. Whenever possible, we replace business travel with teleconferencing and look to use the most environmental travel methods available, such as trains instead of airplanes.

Tell us more about the recent inaugural public debt offering, which raised $150 million in sustainability bonds. How will CPC use that capital?

McKeown: The capital that was raised supports our nonprofit mission of investing in affordable and sustainable multifamily housing in New York State. CPC’s construction lending is concentrated in New York State, and overall, one of the company’s main strategies is to expand its impact within the communities it serves, supported by its continued strong financial position. We applied the proceeds to refinance a portion of our existing debt on our syndicated line of credit that funds our sustainable and affordable multifamily housing projects, of which 75 percent meets the criteria of the 2018 sustainability bond guidelines.

What projects does CPC currently handle in the energy field?

McKeown: In line with CPC’s mission and in an effort to move the entire industry forward in sustainability, we have created several free resources and tools to educate the multifamily ecosystem about the benefits of energy and water conservation methods on their balance sheets, financing options and building operations. These can be used by our clients as well as anyone in the field.

CPC and energy services provider Bright Power developed CPC VeriFi, a free online software application that calculates potential utility savings and helps owners explore financing options for sustainable multifamily building upgrades. In 2017, CPC developed the Underwriting Efficiency guide to provide lenders, public partners and owners with a resource to finance energy and water efficiency measures as part of a first mortgage. We are currently developing a supplement to the guide with a focus on high-performance energy-efficiency practices for new-construction multifamily projects such as Passive House and Net Zero standards that will be published in the summer of 2020.

CPC and lead partner New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) are working on convening a Carbon Neutral Summit later this year in a format conducive to the recommended social distancing guidelines at the time or as a virtual event. The goal of the Summit is to bring together a broad group of stakeholders in the real estate sector to discuss what is needed to achieve decarbonization in the built environment and exchange best practices.

What about investment properties? What measures is CPC taking to lower their carbon footprint?

McKeown: Currently, energy efficiency is a key consideration that we weigh when determining whether to make an equity investment. We also actively encourage our equity partners to consider energy-efficiency upgrades at their existing buildings. CPC is exploring a variety of strategies to reduce emissions at our investment properties, including a combination of tenant engagement, energy-efficiency upgrades and renewable energy generation and/or purchasing.

How advanced is sustainability in today’s affordable housing sector?

McKeown: Overall, sustainability is not integrated enough in the affordable housing space. Subsidies cannot be extended to cover the upfront cost increases associated with high-performance energy efficiency, making it difficult to obtain. More needs to be done to reinforce and expand the financing infrastructure for affordable projects that are also sustainable.

There are different considerations and resources available based on whether the project is affordable housing per a regulatory agreement with the city or state or naturally affordable based on local market factors. The mortgage market has tremendous power to drive demand through programs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s green lending programs and the NYSERDA Multifamily Performance Program. And subsidy sources require standards such as the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria currently used for New York City’s projects funded by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

How do you see the affordable housing sector unfolding in the foreseeable future?

McKeown: The good news is that U.S. states and cities are rapidly adopting clean energy goals, leading to more stringent energy codes and requiring participation from the real estate and building sectors. Therefore, there is a growing interest in energy-efficient, low-carbon buildings, in addition to their improved durability and comfort.

There are certain regulations in New York City and State that are meant to significantly reduce emissions from real estate in the coming decades. In New York City, the Climate Mobilization Act & Local Law 97 is a suite of legislation pieces aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the city’s building stock 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. Current buildings with one or more rent-regulated units are exempt from Local Law 97 to make the preservation of affordable housing stock more viable and attractive.

However, these buildings will likely be included eventually as well, perhaps with longer timelines or less stringent caps. In New York State, the Climate Law and Community Protection Act is a historic climate law that puts New York on a path to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The question that remains is will the fines and penalties be enough to drive demand?","McKeown: The capital that was raised supports our nonprofit mission of investing in affordable and sustainable multifamily housing in New York State.

113,https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/built-environment/case-funding-affordable-green-housing-15898864/,"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Corporate Knights Magazine,The case for funding more affordable green housing,"In an urban landscape punctuated by glass condos and gleaming offices, the four city-owned parcels that have bobbed to the surface of Toronto’s anxious conversation about housing affordability are nothing to look at . . . for now. They are mainly parking lots with a few desultory municipal buildings, located within steps of suburban or downtown transit stops – all choice examples of “lazy land” in a city struggling mightily with real estate speculation and crushingly low apartment vacancy rates.

These sites represent the beginning of a concerted drive by the City of Toronto to develop thousands of units of affordable rental apartments on publicly owned land – a program known as Housing Now that grew from a campaign pledge by Mayor John Tory to build 10,000 residential units on 11 swaths of vacant municipal land, including 3,700 that will be designated “deeply affordable.”

In many European cities, large segments of the population live in rental buildings that sit on public land. Indeed, the so-called Vienna model – a system for building affordable rental apartments on public land that goes back to the 1920s and is lauded for its accessibility – offers compelling proof that quality urban housing isn’t just the product of market forces.

Toronto’s plan has echoes of the Vienna model. The city will leverage its own real estate to attract apartment developers, both for-profit firms and non-profits. But they must be willing to sign on to unusual terms: the city will offer builders prime locations, financial incentives (reduced development charges, for instance) and 99-year lease agreements instead of outright land sales, as normally happens when public land is redeveloped. The quid pro quo is that property managers must guarantee affordable rents for a century. The builders that win the right to develop these first four sites will be made public this spring. CreateTO, the city agency responsible for these projects, expects construction to begin by late 2020 and will soon make other sites available.

While city officials are attaching all sorts of planning conditions to these deals, one in particular stands out: they must satisfy a set of demanding environmental performance benchmarks set out in the 2018 version of the “Toronto Green Standard” (TGS), which lays out the sustainable design requirements for new private and city-owned developments. That should translate into features such as better-insulated walls, less exterior window space, improved heating and ventilation systems and other measures meant to reduce a building’s carbon footprint.

“It’s important that if we have an environmental emergency and we have a homelessness and housing crisis, there’s a way to leverage these sites and [address] both,” says Mark Richardson, spokesperson for HousingNowTO, an advocacy group tracking the rollout of the program.

“The upfront costs may be high for creating more sustainable buildings, but in the long term, the operating costs will be lower.”

Forking out for sustainable affordable housing

Like a growing number of cities, Toronto last fall declared a climate emergency and is developing an ambitious plan to slash building-related emissions by 65% (from 1990 levels) over the next decade. But given mounting public concern about escalating real estate, condo and rental costs, it’s also clear that sustainably designed affordable housing projects, such as those envisioned for the Housing Now sites, have become increasingly critical in meeting the city’s climate and social-inclusion goals.

“Climate change and housing affordability are the two most difficult challenges facing communities and the country,” says Jake Stacey, vice-president of impact banking at Vancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB), which is launching a “green commercial mortgage” this spring to finance projects that combine both objectives.

Older buildings will also have to pull their weight. Hundreds of slab apartment towers constructed in the 1960s and ’70s will require deep energy retrofits (new windows, insulation, LED lights, airtight building envelopes, high-efficiency mechanical systems, etc.) to meet council’s carbon reduction targets. But in the past, financing for such undertakings was elusive. Some of the capital costs can be recouped by reductions in operating costs related to energy efficiency retrofits, but property owners need other sources of financing if they hope to make these fixes without hiking rents.

At various times, public funding programs have helped make the math work, but mostly on the margins. Case in point: since 2000, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities’ Green Municipal Fund has provided $5.1 million in grants and $31.3 million in loans to a handful of social housing complexes looking to cut emissions.

The Atmospheric Fund (TAF) has provided $10 million in financing for 22 energy-efficiency retrofit projects around the Greater Toronto Area, mostly older apartments, using a profit-sharing formula that sees TAF finance the capital expenditures and keep about 90% of the energy savings. The organization invests from an endowment established by the City of Toronto in the 1990s.

There are also a few sources of private sector financing. VCIB’s lending program has underwritten more than 1,200 rooftop solar and geothermal energy projects for residential buildings. The bank also recently acquired CoPower, which sells green bonds that have financed about 400 energy-efficiency retrofits. VCIB’s commercial green mortgages, says Stacey, will allow property owners to borrow against long-term value growth created in their buildings by energy-efficiency capital upgrades, such as tighter building envelopes, new mechanical systems and LED lighting conversion projects.

Yet new public dollars will likely deliver most of the needed investment. This spring, Ottawa will begin flowing about $300 million from a 2019 federal budget commitment for a sustainable affordable housing program. Toronto Community Housing will receive $1.3 billion from the $55 billion National Housing Strategy for overdue repairs to its portfolio, with a portion of those funds earmarked for energy retrofits. A further $300 million from the federal government will help municipalities offer retrofit financing for low-rise homes, and it seems likely that governments will add even more to these pots of funding to counter the recessionary impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Housing Now philosophy offers a variation on the theme. The city is aiming to entice developers by leasing prime land and providing breaks on development charges and property taxes in exchange for more sustainably designed projects.

This latest version of the TGS, according to one city estimate, will add about 3.5% to overall construction costs. Yet advocates say that such buildings in the long run are financially attractive because they slash energy expen-ses over decades. They also tend to be better constructed, meaning they require less age-related maintenance.

As it turns out, the implicit formula – additional upfront investment in sustainable design in anticipation of lower long-term operating and maintenance costs – is exceptionally well suited to companies and non-profits that own multi-unit residential buildings and don’t intend to sell them any time soon. Yet it remains to be seen how hard Toronto officials will push the Housing Now developers to maximize the sustainability features of their plans. Richardson says CreateTO’s evaluation rubric doesn’t assign enough weight to the green design aspects of the proposals submitted by the development groups vying to build on these four pieces of land. In late February, CreateTO spokesperson Susan O’Neill said it was too soon to comment.

Greening building codes

For many years, sustainable-design activists, especially in North America, complained that building codes were far too lenient and set minimum standards that allowed developers to erect structures that leaked energy in the form of heat. Many of the condo towers that have sprung up in Toronto in recent years fit the critique. Their perfunctory concrete balconies jettison heat, while the wall-sized windows are so cheaply made and shoddily installed that they either radiate cold or transform small apartments into convection ovens, depending on the season and time of day.

Voluntary green building certifications such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system have historically been taken up by only a small percentage of builders. (Since 2004, only 4,350 buildings have been LEED certified in Canada, according to the Canada Green Building Council, which oversees the certification process. To put that figure in context, the country erected nearly 20,000 new buildings in December 2019 alone.) In the meantime, other, less demanding, voluntary standards have come on the market, such as Energy Star, which rates residential dwellings for energy efficiency.

But in the past decade or so, provincial governments in Ontario and BC have revised their building codes to make them more demanding in terms of energy efficiency and performance. Vancouver and Toronto have gone even further with their own municipal codes, joining a growing cohort of cities pushing to achieve or surpass 80% reductions in carbon emissions by 2050.

The TGS aspires to ensure that all new buildings will attain “near zero” emissions by 2030. The code offers builders more stringent voluntary features and then sets out an aggressive timetable for making those optional elements mandatory – a system known as a “step code.” One such change in Toronto’s green building standard: much tougher rules for the so-called wall-to-window ratio, a shift that will effectively end the practice of building towers clad almost entirely in glass.

According to Lisa King, the senior policy planner who oversees the TGS, the 2018 rules have attracted all sorts of builders interested in developing projects that satisfy the code’s tougher voluntary requirements. “What’s exciting, under [the newest version], which is difficult [to satisfy] because it has absolute targets, is that we’re seeing a quick adjustment in the market.” She says numerous proposals have come in from firms developing smaller commercial or office buildings as well as rental buildings.

Passive houses pass on cost savings

One public agency has decided to aim even higher. Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) has embarked on an ambitious plan to build 21 townhouses in Alexandra Park, a downtown affordable-housing complex, that meet the most demanding voluntary targets in the TGS – a set of benchmarks that are virtually the same as “passive house,” a German certification method associated with draft-free structures that have, among other things, thickly insulated walls, state-of-the-art windows and extremely low energy bills.

After an unusual competitive bidding process was completed last year, a consortium led by Tridel and Diamond Schmitt Architects won the contract, estimated to be worth about $10 million. The tender process was out of the ordinary because the two finalists had to present their plans to community members, who voted on the one they wanted.

TCHC architect Michael Lam, who will be the senior construction manager, says the project will be the first of its kind in Greater Toronto.

While residential passive-house developments, both for-profit and non-profit, have gone up in Vancouver, Ottawa and Hamilton, none have been completed in Toronto. “We don’t have a lot of experience with this,” Lam says.

Officials with TCHC, which is in the process of redeveloping and intensifying a number of its housing complexes, looked ahead five or six years and realized that more demanding green building codes, especially for city-owned projects, were inevitable as the TGS evolves. So Lam and his team decided to get ahead of the curve. “We thought, ‘We’ve got an incredible opportunity in our own revitalization projects,’ and this [the townhouses] was a fairly well-delineated project.”

Because certified passive-house projects feature extremely airtight designs, smart heating/cooling and humidity-control systems, natural interior materials that don’t cast off chemical smells, and all sorts of devices tasked with capturing and recycling waste energy (from hot water going down drains or from bathroom ventilation fans, for instance), the design process is far from conventional, Lam explains. The team’s architects, engineers, energy consultants and constructors must all work together to figure out how they’ll create structures that satisfy a demanding set of performance standards. “The objective of the building is so different that it requires a different design process and a different way of thinking about how architect, engineering and energy modelling work together,” says Lam. Detailed designs will be unveiled later this spring, and construction is expected to begin in about a year

An Ottawa non-profit supportive-housing provider, Salus, went down this road a few years ago, with a 40-unit apartment complex for people with mental health issues. The project consists of 300-square-foot apartments with small kitchenettes, about a fifth of which are barrier-free. “At the time, [passive house] was not something that was on the landscape,” says Salus executive director Lisa Ker.

In 2013, Salus was trying to figure out what to do with a piece of donated land when a manager with a national affordable-housing umbrella group suggested they try developing a passive house project. Ker’s advisors predicted that the costs would be 6 to 9% above a more typical building. But, as she points out, Salus was the first in the market, so they had no real basis to evaluate. “We were very much an experiment.”

However, Salus’s donors were very interested, and not just because of the environmental features. As Ker points out, Salus’s clients live on the fringes of society and are generally seen to be contributing little. Living in a cutting-edge project, she says, “was a great opportunity to show they could bring something to the equation.”

Salus’s architect, CSV principal Anthony Leaning, adds that passive house projects are notably comfortable to be in, and so the design could improve clients’ health and well-being. And, he says, the durability of the building materials means such projects “will last a long time.”

CSV is now working on numerous other passive house affordable-housing projects, and Leaning points out that Ottawa’s public housing agency has also begun to promote aggressive environmental standards in its newest projects. Some of the federal government’s $55 billion 10-year National Housing Strategy funding will pay for large-scale energy-efficiency retrofits of older affordable-housing projects that need everything from new boilers to proper windows (in addition to funding 125,000 new housing units). “There’s a shift happening,” Leaning says of the affordable-housing sector’s growing embrace of energy-efficiency design.

Building on lessons learned

This story, of course, isn’t just about the performance of individual buildings. HousingNowTO’s Mark Richardson points out that the best strategy for reducing the emissions associated with any apartment building is to situate it close to a transit stop. Such locational decisions also bring financial dividends because the developer may not need to build a giant, expensive underground parking lot in such projects, provided municipal planning officials waive those requirements.

TCHC’s Michael Lam hopes that as for-profit builders like Tridel gain experience with more environmentally ambitious projects, such as the townhouses in Alexandra Park, they’ll begin to incorporate those energy- and cost-saving features in more market-oriented apartment building projects. “They’re seeing the writing on the wall: ‘Sooner or later, we’ll be asked to do this.’”

Anthony Leaning says municipal governments should be promoting the case for green affordable housing by offering to fast-track the approvals of such projects and waiving development fees.

The Housing Now program that is attracting so much attention certainly has deployed all available carrots and sticks – more demanding minimum-energy and ecological-performance standards, but also breaks on a range of charges, including property taxes. And as with TCHC’s Alexandra Park venture, the eventual winning Housing Now bidders will include both for-profit and non-profit developers, meaning there’s an opportunity for the design lessons to find their way into the private development sector.

VCIB’s Jake Stacey adds that as recently as two years ago, few builders or agencies would have had the chops or the courage to attempt a net-zero or near-zero building, of any sort. But as more organizations gain experience in building or rebuilding affordable housing that meets the ambitious emission-reduction standards we’ll need in the near future, other agencies, developers and financing sources will fall into line.

“There’s a way to do it,” she says. “I want to be out in front of this.”

Storied investor Steven Dietz‘s earliest investments were in two businesses that are household names today: Costco and Starbucks.

As one of three founders of Upfront Ventures, he subsequently went on to back PetSmart, Ulta Beauty and Office Depot (among others) during his time at the Santa Monica, California-based venture firm.

Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily

In July 2016, he sold his stake in Upfront to his two partners after the firm had grown to become one of the largest and most successful venture funds in Southern California. His individual portfolio had five exits valued over $1 billion.

But now, Dietz is on a different mission. The former VC is founder of a 2-year-old, Culver City, California-based startup called United Dwelling, which aims to tackle the affordable housing problem using data, creativity, and underutilized garages and backyards.

This morning, United Dwelling announced it raised a $10 million Series B led by Alpha Edison with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners. The financing brings the company’s venture raised to $12.2 million over its lifetime, according to Crunchbase data. United Dwelling had previously raised $2 million in a Series A round (funded by Dietz) at a pre-money valuation of $18 million. It declined to disclose the valuation at which the Series B was raised.

‘Immense’ opportunity

I hopped on a call with Dietz this week to hear more details about the company, in addition to his plans for the new capital.

He told me United Dwelling plans to eventually build thousands of Accessory Dwelling Units, which are basically 369-square-foot studio homes. The company said its units benefit homeowners who are looking for ways to supplement their income as well as tenants looking for low-cost housing options.

The company’s approach is kind of genius really.

United Dwelling uses data to identify potential lots that would be suitable for its units. It targets mostly low-and middle-income neighborhoods, with some exceptions for workforce housing. The company at first was going to just remodel garages but discovered quickly it’s much easier to tear down old ones and start fresh. So that’s what it does. It replaces those garages with small, affordable and zero net carbon homes in low-density neighborhoods with no out-of-pocket costs to property owners.

It then sets a rental price for the newly built unit and manages the property on the homeowner’s behalf, keeping a share of the rental income. Upon completion of construction, United Dwelling gives the homeowner the option to buy the unit back from the company for just under $88,000. To keep the costs of construction down, United Dwelling aims to build at least five units within a two-mile radius in the same time frame. Its initial focus is on the Los Angeles region with plans to eventually expand to the Bay Area and other locations once its solidifies its process, according to Dietz.

Specifically, the company plans to build over 150 of its detached studio homes in Southern California in 2020 and over 1,500 in 2021 (assuming construction can continue moving forward as an essential function per Los Angeles COVID-19 policy).

“Affordable housing is one of the most daunting challenges facing California and other parts of the county that is both entirely man-made and completely solvable,” Dietz said. “Here, we can do something that’s incredibly relevant. The opportunity is truly immense. Affordable housing is pretty easy. All you need is inexpensive land and construction, and capital.”

Building ‘something beautiful’

Ramping up took some time because Dietz not only had to seek permits, he also had to pursue amendments to laws for his concept to work.

“The permits were easy, but the underlying rules had to be changed so that our units could be built at all,” he told Crunchbase News.

United Dwelling’s proposal to homeowners is for the company to lease the space for 15 years, build out the studio home and then manage the property on their behalf. As mentioned above, the homeowner has the option to buy it out upon completion.

“We make this all turnkey for them,” Dietz said. “So many people just used their garages to store junk they just didn’t know how to get rid of. We optimize the value proposition for the homeowner and tenant, and inexpensively build something beautiful.”

Rents will be about 20 percent less than a one bedroom in the same community. Depending on the neighborhood, rents will range as low as about $1,300 to as high as $2,100. For example, a nurse working at Cedar Sinai who can’t afford to live anywhere near Beverly Hills might be able to rent one of United Dwelling’s studio homes for less than whatever else is available.

Dietz said the company has the potential to generate revenue from the rental income, possible sale of the unit back to the homeowner and from property management fees.

Looking ahead

United Dwelling plans to use its capital raise for construction-related costs such as the purchase of required specialized equipment. The company won’t expand out of the Los Angeles area in the short term.

“I’ve learned a clear lesson from the retailers I’ve funded,” Dietz told me. “You don’t grow geographically until all the processes are absolutely nailed down.”

Nick Grouf, founder and managing director of Alpha Edison, believes the United Dwelling team “has developed a smart, data-driven approach to make a meaningful impact on the affordable housing crisis, through the efficient manufacturing and installation” of its Accessory Dwelling Units.

Meanwhile, Lightspeed Managing Director Jeremy Liew said Dietz’s exceptional track record “speaks volumes about him as an investor and business leader.”

He added that not only will the company help meaningfully address the housing crisis, it will also “be a model of sustainable, equitable and forward-looking entrepreneurship.”

THE article “‘Green hydrogen’ nearly affordable” (The News 5/5/20) incorrectly stated that it was South Australia’s Labor government, rather than the Liberal government, that was backing the production of hydrogen from water.

South Australia’s Liberal government is led by Premier Steven Marshall who was involved in a “ground breaking ceremony” at Hydrogen Park south of Adelaide on 1 December 2019.

The Victorian (Labor) and the federal (Liberal National) governments have together given $100 million towards making hydrogen from brown coal in the Latrobe Valley.

A SMALL processing plant nearing completion in Bayview Road, Hastings can be seen as representing a much larger struggle between competing sides in the race to produce hydrogen.

The Hastings plant will turn hydrogen gas into liquid to be exported to Japan for use as a clean fuel in vehicles.

However, the hydrogen comes from processing brown coal in the Latrobe Valley and necessitates the “capture and storage” of CO2, a by-product that will not be exported.

Meanwhile, Queensland and South Australia – also Labor states – are backing the production of hydrogen from water using solar or wind power.

Essentially, “green hydrogen” is produced by using electrolysis to split water into oxygen and hydrogen.

Although power intensive, its proponents say renewable power is getting cheaper all the time and electrolysis will quickly become more cost effective than coal.

Environment Victoria’s campaigns manager Dr Nicholas Aberle said the Latrobe Valley pilot project “problematic as it could be the thin end of the wedge”.

“They’re not testing the carbon capture storage part of the project and [using brown coal] remains a false hope for [jobs in] the Latrobe Valley.”

Dr Aberle had “no doubt” that hydrogen would be part of the energy supply chain in the future, “but this is not green hydrogen, the race is really over before it’s started”.

“Coal to hydrogen remains a short-term and polluting source of energy. The future will no doubt involve growing use of hydrogen as a fuel, but it needs to be clean hydrogen.

“Producing hydrogen from renewable energy will soon be cost-competitive and will always be cleaner and less risky than using coal.

“This pilot project is just another pipe dream of things to do with Latrobe Valley coal. Pretending coal-to-hydrogen has a future serves only to distract from the real economic diversification task facing that community.”

Precautions against COVID-19 are being taken to protect workers involved in the brown-coal-to-hydrogen pilot project at Hastings and in the Latrobe Valley.

“We remain fully committed to navigating through these challenging times with resilience and continue working to our ambitious, mutual hydrogen vision,” the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain’s project partners stated last month.

While the state and federal governments have each backed the HESC consortium led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries with $50 million, South Australia and Queensland are supporting “green hydrogen” plants rather than relying on a process that involves releasing CO2 from fossil fuels.

Critics say the coal should be left in the ground rather than releasing CO2 in the hydrogen-making process and then trying to store it underground with questionable sequestration methods.

The state government’s commitment is based on the hope that it can lead to further exploitation of the area’s vast brown coal fields as well as providing jobs to a workforce crippled by the collapse of coal-fired power stations.

The federal government is also spending $70 million through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by inviting and then assessing submissions for “green hydrogen” projects. Labor governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT say no public money should be spent on using fossil fuels to produce hydrogen.

The federal government has committed a further $300m so the Clean Energy Finance Corporation can “invest” in hydrogen energy projects using fossil fuels or “green” alternatives.

The Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), Jemena, AusNet Services and Evoenergy wants to see natural gas supplies in the eastern and southern states blended with up to 10 per cent “green hydrogen” by 2030.

The Queensland government is contributing to a hydrogen plant in Gladstone with a view to supplying 10 per cent blended hydrogen to 770 properties by December 2021.

Hydrogen Park South Australia is scheduled to be operational by mid-year, supplying blended gas (5 per cent hydrogen) to 710 households in Mitchell Park.

The South Australian government sees its wind and solar power generating capacity as enabling the state to eventually export “green hydrogen”.

During the past two months, many of us have spent more time at home than we normally do.

Although the economy is slowly starting to reopen, why not take some time to create a cozy space inside your home that is welcoming and relaxing? You'll enjoy it even when you start venturing out more.

Here are nine easy and affordable tips on how to do that.

Make your bed every morning

Think about your bed as the one thing you can control. It can start your day off right, creating a sense of order as you go about tackling bigger issues. Spruce up your resting space with fluffy pillows, clean sheets and a comforter that is soft and comfortable. Your bed should be inviting and snug.

Use scent to enhance your environment

Fragrance is a great way to bring the outdoors in and elevate any living space. Burning candles or using a diffuser are popular choices. Other options include purchasing an indoor plant, which can not only beautify your home, but also offer delightful scents. Plants such as jasmine, eucalyptus and lavender are great options for any area in the home. Or try oil diffuser sticks, which can last for upward of six months.

Allow natural light in

Open the shades and allow the sun to come in. Not only does the sunlight help to enhance mood and energy, it can also help to set your internal clock in motion. Natural light is especially important in the winter months when those who are affected by seasonal affective disorder tend to experience depression and negative emotions.

Declutter and donate

This is an excellent time to go through closets, dressers, drawers and garages to rid yourself of items you no longer need or want. How often do we keep things out of convenience or obligation? Designate some time to go through and declutter your space and your life. Think about the things you no longer have any use for and donate them to an organization that helps those in need. What is no longer useful for you will be a treasure and blessing for someone else.

Create a quiet nook just for you

You don’t need an actual nook — a corner will do just fine. Find a space in your home that is tucked away and make the area a designated reading, meditation or lounging place. Place a comfortable chair and ottoman there along with some plush pillows and a small table (to hold that cup of coffee or tea). Make sure this space is just for relaxing and not an area where you are typing away on a laptop!

Incorporate paintings and pictures that are meaningful to you

Hang up that painting you picked up while on vacation years ago and then forgot about. Frame the card that your best friend gave you or maybe create your own art. Nothing creates a sanctuary better than being surrounded by memories and pictures of things and people you love. Search for an old window frame and string twine across the front and hang pictures and cards with clothespins.

Decorative elements

To create the retreat you have always wanted, pick up some flowers from a farmers market. Oftentimes just one bouquet can be split into many vases and spread throughout the house. Another great idea is placing basil, thyme or other herbs into clear vases and lining them on the windowsill. Not only do they beautify your space, they also smell great.

Enhance your entrance

Ensure your front door is free of clutter and dead plants. Make the entryway inviting and easy to access. A beautiful wreath on the door or some flowers along the pathway is not only a wonderful sight for you as you return home, but also for your visitors.

Rest and relax

Add anything else you might enjoy such as a record player or Bluetooth speakers in your nook area or organize a neat stack of books next to your bedside table. I love collecting seashells and rocks on vacation and have them displayed in delicate bowls all around the house as reminders of beautiful places I have been. Last of all, rest and relax. Take this time to enjoy your surroundings and be kind to yourself and others.

The project, which has received significant pushback from Island residents, conservationists, and stakeholders, has gone through several significant redesigns since it was first presented to the Martha’s Vineyard Commission over a year ago.

The 54-acre property was purchased for $6.6 million in June 2017 by developers Douglas K. Anderson and Richard G. Matthews, operating as Meeting House Way LLC. Their listed address is in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Concerns over the project — one of the largest the commission has reviewed — include potential impact on traffic conditions, Island urbanization, nitrogen loading, and animal habitat loss.

In September, when the project was last in front of the LUPC, the MVC’s subcommittee voted to recommend the full commission deny the project.

In its current form, the project proposes to establish 30 acres as open space and develop the other 20-odd acres with 28 single-family homes and a cluster of affordable townhouses.

The latest change to the project was to add four additional affordable townhouses, for a total of 14. The cluster of below-market-rate townhouses would be dedicated to first-time homebuyers and empty nesters, elderly people who have lived on the Island for 15-plus years, but are looking to downsize. In addition to the townhouses, the project also calls for a 1 percent fee to the Edgartown affordable housing committee on any future sale of the development’s other homes, and a flat $1 million contribution.

On Monday, project attorney Sean Murphy told commissioners the price for the townhouses dropped to 10 units at $389,000 and four at $359,000. “They will be the lowest priced real estate on Martha’s Vineyard,” Murphy said.

Prices for the townhouses were based on construction costs, and Murphy said the developers would be breaking even on them.

The townhouses would have a separate homeowners association.

The 28 single-family houses would be spaced out on ½-acre to 1-acre lots, and would be allowed a maximum of five bedrooms. Houses would be limited to 3,800 square feet. Garages are optional, and would be permitted a 400-square-foot living space above, which would be added to the bedroom count. The project also calls for the single-family houses to incorporate SmartFlower solar arrays.

The LUPC took no vote on the project. The project heads to the full commission on June 4 at 5:30 pm.","The expansive Meeting House Way project headed back to the Martha’s Vineyard Commission’s (MVC) Land Use Planning Committee (LUPC) Monday night with an updated design, including additional affordable housing units.

In its current form, the project proposes to establish 30 acres as open space and develop the other 20-odd acres with 28 single-family homes and a cluster of affordable townhouses.
The latest change to the project was to add four additional affordable townhouses, for a total of 14.
“They will be the lowest priced real estate on Martha’s Vineyard,” Murphy said."

Bill Cavanaught, one of the co-owners of US Modular told me that when he heard the stories of the women who needed housing and were unable to find adequate homes for themselves and their children, he went to work to try and build them the best houses possible. He says he needed to work very tightly on the budget, but wanted to include all of the amenities into these houses that he puts in all of his higher priced ones.

The motto of the NEW is “to transform the lives of the community, including Latinas and their families, with cutting edge and sustainable pathways to success.”

I had an opportunity to talk with Alicia Matricardi, Director of Real Estate and General Counsel for New Economics for Women Organization.

How did you get involved in it? Can you tell me a little about you?

I started here as an intern in high school, and believed so much in the mission and the work of the organization that I conducted my senior thesis at UC Berkeley on affordable housing and utilized what New Economics for Women did in the thesis. I was invited to work here right after, and moved back to my hometown of Los Angeles for the position. I left that position to attend law school, and after law school began practicing in real estate. NEW needed the help of a practitioner who also knew a little something about the law, and a position was created here to bring out the best in me and I have been dedicated to doing so ever since.

How did you get US Modular involved?

We went to public bid by modular contractors about six years ago to help us with one of our single-family development projects and US Modular made for a great fit. They helped to introduce us to the world of modular construction with an understanding that we wanted to make sure that our product would fit well within a stick-built more traditional single-family community in a suburb of Los Angeles— the beautiful working-class neighborhood of Canoga Park in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.

How do you select the women to get these homes?

The purchasers were not exclusively women— though we perform outreach to make sure that women are included as potential buyers, we sell to anyone qualified! Please see the attached as an example of our soft-second program. Our grant funding enabled the sale of each of our 8 modular homes to families earning no higher than 120% Area Median Income. We attached soft-seconds to the house to reduce the cost of entry to each family, but to preserve comps in the neighborhood and not close any lower than market value for the area. We also require that the note we carry back on each home keep the home owner occupied for 20 years. Should someone want to sell, we get our soft-second back and a piece of their equity relative to the portion of the equity we carried back on the note— we want to create homeowners and not fund flippers with our precious federal funds for low- to moderate-income purchasers.

Bill Cavanaugh, co-owner of USModular Inc. says he was inspired to build these houses when he happened to meet some people involved with the New Economic for Women Organization. “At the 10 year anniversary party of the Tierra del Sol apartment project and Charter school built by New Economic for Women – I heard stories from children , young adults and mothers of the impact that having a clean, safe place to live and study made on the lives. The room was filled with cheers and tears and I knew that we had to get involved to help build homes for New Economic for Women – so they could continue on their mission to help families get into quality, affordable , housing”

Cavanaugh went on to say that in order to make this happen, “We reduced our standard fees ( OHP) by 23% to help New Economics for Women meet the requirements of the landers for the project.”","With the cooperation of the US Modular and New Economics for Women Organization, (NEW) eight beautiful and efficient houses have been built in Canoga Park, CA.

Learn more.

Every TRIWA Ocean Plastic watch features both a solid case and fabric band made entirely out of ocean plastic, 8 million metric tons of which is dumped into the sea annually.

The Time for Oceans watches are lightweight, affordable, and can be worn with casual or business casual clothing.

These watches are only the latest TRIWA timepieces with a cause; the company earlier began offering watches made from Humanium Metal, a material created by melting down illegal firearms.

A good watch is never merely a timepiece but is also a reliable conversation piece. I've drawn several compliments about the understated but handsome gray TRIWA watch often on my wrist these days, and I'm always thrilled when the compliment giver seems genuinely interested in hearing about the watch.

Because with a backstory like this, the watch is worth the time.

Like every piece in the Time for Oceans collection, before it was on my wrist keeping the time, my TRIWA Ocean Plastic watch was just a bunch of trash floating out there in the open water.

Mostly, anyway – the precision Japanese movement has some metal in it, and the face is protected by mineral glass, but we'll forgive them for it, considering that the solid case and comfortable fabric band were once shopping bags, discarded toys, six-pack rings, and all the other garbage polluting our seas.

My TRIWA Time for Oceans watch. Steven John

The TRIWA story

Founded in 2007, the TRIWA name is an amalgamation of the words Transforming the Industry of Watches. The company set out to offer watches that were simple, stylish, and affordable despite their high quality.

I can't say whether or not this Swedish brand has changed the watch world, but I can say that its work has done plenty to improve the world at large. A few years back, the company launched its Time for Peace line of watches which featured chronometers made primarily using Humanium Metal, which is metal produced by melting down seized illegal firearms. Now it has a new collection aimed at using recycled ocean plastic.

To make an Ocean Plastic watch TRIWA sources their ""ocean material"" from #tide, a Swiss company (the irony of this from a landlocked nation is not lost) that produces useable plastic pellets sourced entirely from ocean plastics. The resulting timepieces are surprisingly durable, handsome, and priced well.

TRIWA

What the Time for Oceans watches are like to wear

TRIWA Ocean Plastic watch looks perfect on your wrist with a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a button-down with a rolled-up sleeve, or as you hike, bike, or surf. Safe down to 10 ATM, or 100 meters below sea level, you can wear this watch while swimming or diving, and of course, rain and sweat are no issue. The watches are available in four colors, ranging from simple black to bright coral orange.

The ocean-plastic case is on the smaller side, measuring about 38 millimeters across, but the fabric band (made from ocean plastic as well, of course) is broad and has a ruggedly casual look. It features enough closely-spaced holes for the watch to work for just about any adult wrist.

On the face, the three, six, and nine are shown in prominent numerals, with marks for the other hours and minutes around the bezel. The hands are each a different color and are kept on track by a Japanese Citizen Miyota movement, and the back of the dial has a subtle textured pattern that, on inspection, you'll realize is reminiscent of gentle ocean waves.

Oh, and these watches sell for all of $129, hardly a steep price for a good watch backed by a good cause.

The black color I have is easy to dress up or down, though the sporty style can only go so far with nicer outfits. Steven John

Cons to consider

All that goodness notwithstanding, these watches are not going to cut it with any more formal attire, so if you're looking for a watch for work in your more traditional office near the same price point, maybe try something like Filippo Loreti (though, note that shipping times are long for this company since their watches are made to order). And if you want a fancier dive watch at a slightly higher price point, go with Martnero.

Also, I wish these watches were available in more than one case size, but that may well be fixed down the line, as this collection is still new in town.

The bottom line

TRIWA Ocean Plastic watches are comfortable, good looking, reliable, and manufactured primarily out of recycled plastic using a process powered by solar energy, all of which is awesome. They are well worth their modest price tag.

Even if one doesn't become your new go-to, but is instead your surf/hike/bike/run wristwatch, you will still have made a good buy of a respectable product.","Every TRIWA Ocean Plastic watch features both a solid case and fabric band made entirely out of ocean plastic, 8 million metric tons of which is dumped into the sea annually.

121,https://www.autonews.com/china/vw-choose-new-brand-lead-affordable-ev-project,"Mon, 04 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Automotive News,VW to choose new brand to lead affordable EV project,"FRANKFURT -- Volkswagen Group is reconsidering which of its brands will develop a new family of small electric vehicles after its Spanish unit, Seat, lost the project.

VW Group CEO Herbert Diess said in March 2019 that Seat would lead development of full-electric city cars that will cost less than 20,000 euros. Diess said they would replace the full-electric versions of the VW Up, Skoda Citigo and Seat Mii and would be ""a great step toward an even more affordable electric mobility.""

One source close to Seat said the VW brand will now head the project. Executives at VW Group's headquarters in Wolfsburg believe that the decision will be ""more efficient in terms of synergies,"" the source said.

The small EVs will be based on a heavily modified version of VW Group's MEB electric-vehicle architecture shortened to less than 4000 mm (157.5 inches), or roughly the length of the VW Polo.

MEB underpins the VW ID3, a compact hatchback due to launch this summer in Europe as the first of the automaker's new generation of battery-powered EVs for the mass market.

Adapting the architecture for a family of small city cars in a cost-efficient way is proving to be challenging because of the need to strip out a third of the costs compared with the ID3. Engineers have looked at everything from smaller electric motors to different battery module configurations to give the small EVs the high standard of crash protection that will be expected by customers.

Seat's selection to engineer and take on responsibility for the MEB Entry family was a coup for the once struggling Spanish automaker. It demonstrated VW Group's confidence in CEO Luca de Meo who delivered profits after his 2015 appointment as head of the brand. De Meo has since quit VW Group and will take up the post of Renault CEO on July 1.","VW Group CEO Herbert Diess said in March 2019 that Seat would lead development of full-electric city cars that will cost less than 20,000 euros.

123,https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/5-affordable-skincare-dupes-are-just-effective-high-end-ones,"Sat, 30 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AsiaOne,5 affordable skincare dupes that are just as effective as high-end ones,"As Singaporeans take precautions to reduce the transmission of Covid-19, wearing masks has become second-nature. Essential workers in particular have to wear masks for extended periods of time.

However, due to the tight fit required, wearing a mask all day at work, especially in heat and humidity, could lead to skin damage.

Professor Karen Ousey, the Director of the Institute of Skin Integrity and Infection Prevention at the University of Huddersfield, explains that people who wear masks experience sweating, leading to friction that ""causes pressure damage on the nose and cheeks.""

To prevent skin damage, Professor Ousey suggests keeping your skin clean, well-hydrated and moisturised, and to apply barrier creams half an hour before you put on a mask. As we aim to keep our faces hydrated and pain-free, we may end up wondering what products to purchase.

While high-end products may be perceived to produce better results, they're expensive and may not be affordable to most people during this time.

On the other hand, cheaper products may be less effective. To help you build your skincare routine, we found some of the best wallet-friendly dupes to proven high-end luxury skincare products that are just as effective.

1. Facial Treatment Essences

A skincare routine usually consists of several steps. An essence is typically applied after cleansing your face to soften and prime your skin for absorbing subsequent products like serum and moisturiser.

In Asia, the SK-II Facial Treatment Essence has gained a massive following due to an ingredient SK-II calls ""Pitera"". “Pitera” is actually Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate (GFF), a nutrient-dense yeast byproduct of fermented sake that may diminish signs of aging, brighten skin tone and promote cell regeneration.

[[nid:484515]]

However, SK-II’s product is priced at $108/75ml. But there’s an affordable dupe on the market--the COSRX Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence costing just $29.80/100ml. It contains 95per cent GFF, a higher concentration compared to SK-II’s 90per cent.

Both products contain common secondary ingredients like Butelyne Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Water, Sodium Benzoate, Methylparaben, and Sorbic Acid.

However, COSRX’s essence includes other beneficial nutrients like Niacinamide (Vitamin B3 which has anti-aging benefits) and Panthenol (an anti-inflammatory nutrient derived from B vitamins that reduces redness and oxidative stress from the environment).

Not only is this dupe 80per cent cheaper per mL than the SK-II essence, but it also contains more beneficial nutrients for your skin.

2. Exfoliating facials

Exfoliating facials remove dead cells on the outer layer of your skin to reveal a smooth and even complexion. Exfoliating ingredients can come in a cleanser, a serum or at-home peels that typically contain Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA) and/or Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHA).

While AHAs work to combat scarring, BHAs work to exfoliate the top layer of the skin, purge excess oil and prevent acne breakouts. Together, these 2 ingredients help to promote healthy, rejuvenated skin.

For instance, the Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial ($113.50/50ml) and The Ordinary Peeling Solution ($10.60/30ml) are both peeling solutions that contain AHA and BHA. The former contains 25per cent AHA and 2per cent BHA, while the latter contains 30per cent AHA and 2per cent BHA.

However, a higher percentage of AHA doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better as your skin could be more susceptible to irritation, especially if it’s sensitive.

But if you’re looking for an affordable dupe of Drunk Elephant’s, The Ordinary Peeling Solution, which is about 91per cent, cheaper will give you the same exfoliating results. However, you should only exfoliate once or twice a week, as over exfoliating will leave you skin sore and irritated.

3. Night repair serums

Your skin recovers from the day’s damage at night. The extra blood supply to your skin gives it energy to increase its natural repair.

A night repair serum, applied after the facial treatment essence, will help support the skin’s nighttime renewal by providing essential hydration and activating the skin’s nighttime rhythm to reduce signs of aging.

[[nid:478937]]

The Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II ($102.13/50ml) has been a popular choice in the skincare community, and the Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Ampoule ($26.80/50ml) is touted as the dupe.

The common primary ingredient in both serums is Bifida Ferment Lysate, which strengthens the skin’s barrier, while the common secondary ingredient is Hyaluronic Acid, which hydrates the skin.

However, Missha’s night repair serum contains retinol, a form of vitamin A that boosts collagen production, and niacinamide. Both ingredients help fight wrinkles, and aren’t present in Estée Lauder’s night repair serum.

Besides the additional ingredients, Missha’s serum costs about 74per cent less than Estée Lauder’s, which gives you more value for your money. But more ingredients also mean a higher probability of skin irritation after use, so if you have sensitive skin, it may be worth splurging on Estée Lauder’s night repair serum.

4. Cleansers

Cleansing is the first step of your skincare routine to remove excess oil, sweat, makeup and dead skin cells so that you can apply subsequent products like moisturiser or serum.

Face cleansers that contain Glycine Soja (Soybean) have been popular within the skincare community for amino acids that promote healthy and bouncy skin, as well as their gentle cleansing properties.

One of the holy grail cleansers in the skincare community, the Fresh Soy Face Cleanser, is a non-drying gel that comes with a hefty pricetag of $53.90/150ml.

For a cheaper alternative, the Sana By Noevir Nameraka Honpo Soy Milk Facial Cleansing Wash has been recommended by the beauty community as a budget-friendly dupe for its focus and inclusion of Glycine Soja (Soybean) and other soy extracts, costing just $21.13/150ml.

5. Moisturisers

As one of the most important steps in your skincare routine, moisturising helps prevent your skin from drying out by holding moisture in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of your skin. When your stratum corneum is functioning properly, it protects your skin from irritants.

[[nid:489635]]

While all moisturisers on the market can keep your skin hydrated, some are formulated to feel better on the skin or improve moisture barrier.

For instance, the Glow Watermelon Pink Juice Oil-Free Moisturiser ($55.30/60ml) and Bliss What a Melon Hydrator ($28.40/50ml) both contain watermelon extract, which is antioxidant-rich and may replenish lost vitamins and minerals.

Hyaluronic Acid — which hydrates the skin — is a common secondary ingredient in both products. As these 2 moisturisers are so similar, the Bliss What a Melon Hydrator is a cheaper alternative to the Glow Watermelon Pink Juice Oil-Free Moisturiser.

However, the latter contains artificial colouring, which could be a concern for those looking for as little chemicals as possible in their skincare products.

Conclusion: Which product is the best for you?

When it comes to skincare products, your mileage may vary. Before committing to any product, do a patch test to see if you may be allergic to any ingredients.

Instead of buying a full jar or bottle of skincare product from the get-go, try to get some samples from the stores and give yourself time to decide which ones you’re adding to your routine. It’s also important to do your research, read reviews and find out which product to use in each step of a skincare routine.

Besides buying dupes, try to also take advantage of sales and discounts if you see any, so you can get more mileage out of the products you buy. Lastly, you can use a credit card that provides cashback and rewards on beauty purchases.","To help you build your skincare routine, we found some of the best wallet-friendly dupes to proven high-end luxury skincare products that are just as effective.

According to Global Workplace Analytics, a consultancy that helps firms design work-from-home strategies, 56 percent of the US workforce could work from home, and the number of regular work-from-home folks is likely to jump from 3.6 percent to 25 to 30 percent of the workforce by 2021. But according to a survey from WhistleOut, over a third of people say that lack of high-speed internet has prevented them from doing their work.

So let’s say you want to get away from the big city but keep your remote-working lifestyle in the fast lane. We found 15 attractive, affordable small towns and cities across America with gigabit internet connection options and reasonable housing prices-at least more reasonable than in tech hubs like New York, San Francisco, and Seattle.

We used data from Zillow and our partners at Ookla Speedtest to identify towns where Speedtest users verified 1Gbps connections in 2020, and where Zillow’s Home Value Index had an estimated home value of under $250,000 on Jan. 31, 2020. Using Census data, we narrowed it down to towns of under 10,000 that are not suburbs or exurbs of big cities. Then we cross-referenced with some lists of “best small towns” and tried to select places that were appealing.

Appomattox, VA

Population: 1,792

Gigabit ISP: Firefly Fiber ($79.99/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $146,906

Best known for being where the Civil War ended, Appomattox is a charming, historic town in central Virginia. Like with many of the cities on our list, the gigabit fiber here is provided by the local electric company, and you need to be careful about where you live — the Central Virginia Electric Cooperative’s lines cover some streets, but not others. The Digital Divide even exists within a small town.

Bisbee, AZ

Population: 5,209

Gigabit ISP: Sparklight ($125/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $134,376

A former copper-mining town near the Mexican border, Bisbee is a delightfully kooky, artsy little city with a preserved heritage downtown and far more restaurants and art galleries than a place its size ought to have. It’s a very popular day trip from Tucson, which is only about an hour and a half away.

Council Grove, KS

Population: 2,079

Gigabit ISP: TCT ($199.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $104,232

A historic stop on the Santa Fe Trail, Council Grove has two lakes, nature trails, and a riverside walkway. The local chamber of commerce tries to play up the town’s historic sites, but its top appeal appears just to be the peace and quiet of its classic Plains.

Diamondhead, MS

Population: 8,044

Gigabit ISP: C Spire ($80/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $165,574

An upscale and heavily golf-oriented resort community on the Gulf Coast, Diamondhead is right near Bay St. Louis (shown above), which Southern Living Magazine declared to be one of its favorite affordable small towns.

Jonesborough, TN

Population: 5,439

Gigabit ISP: Brightridge ($79.99/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $184,295

Appalachian culture is alive in Jonesborough, a regional cultural hub with a repertory theater, arts center, and a historic downtown with tours led by costumed reenactors. The annual National Storytelling Festival has led Jonesborough to declare itself the “storytelling capital of the world.” The Buffalo Mountain Park and Cherokee National Forest have extensive outdoors opportunities. Nearby Johnson City is a larger commercial hub surrounded by state parks.

Kenai, AK

Population: 7,778

Gigabit ISP: GCI ($174.99/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $242,404

GCI, Alaska’s dominant ISP, has been spreading gigabit service to surprisingly remote locations, including this peninsular city three hours south of Anchorage. You’ll pay for it, but that’s life in Alaska. According to locals, Kenai has good schools, friendly people, and a dramatic landscape. Just know you’ll have to deal with a lot of Anchorage vacationers in July.

Montour Falls, NY

Population: 1,619

Gigabit ISP: Empire Access ($65/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $113,643

The gorgeous (as in, full of gorges) Finger Lakes area of central New York has multiple dueling gigabit providers and a slew of picture-perfect small towns where you can take advantage of the fast connections. Montour Falls is one of the more affordable ones. It’s near wineries and a lakefront and a short drive to charming Corning and Ithaca, and it has a waterfall running through downtown.

Pawlet, VT

Population: 1,386

Gigabit ISP: Vermont Telephone ($69.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $225,247

Rural Pawlet, in the low, rolling Taconic Mountains, is a two-street farming town on the New York border, at least an hour and a half from anywhere. Vermont’s VTC offers not just gigabit symmetric connections but a 10Gbps plan if you’re willing to pay $399.95 per month.

Petoskey, MI

Population: 5,738

Gigabit ISP: Great Lakes Energy ($99.99/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $245,375

People are plenty passionate about pleasant Petoskey, a coastal resort in northern Michigan with a preserved Victorian downtown, beaches, and boating. It’s close to Traverse City, called one of the “best small towns in America” by Architectural Digest. Petoskey is expensive for northern Michigan — so expensive that the local low-wage workers can’t afford to live there — but it’s still much less expensive than many of the coastal cities from which tech workers may be coming.

Price, UT

Population: 8,232

Gigabit ISP: Emery Telecom ($64.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $195,371

Looking for dramatic natural beauty? It comes at a relatively low Price about two hours south of Salt Lake City. A mining town in central Utah, Price has a university with a Prehistoric Museum. It’s also close to the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry and Ninemile Canyon, which is covered with ancient art.

Rangely, CO

Population: 2,291

Gigabit ISP: Visionary ($70/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $199,954

Rangely is in an extremely rural part of Colorado near Dinosaur National Monument (shown above). If you want to be away from it all but near canyons with fossil hunting and rock climbing, this is the town for you. A nearby reservoir satisfies fishing and boating desires.

Salyersville, KY

Population: 1,729

Gigabit ISP: Foothills Communications ($129.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $64,830

Salyersville is an extremely quiet, low-key, tiny city in the Appalachians. There’s a lot of hiking you can do near there, and not much else, but locals say the town is friendly and community-oriented. There’s a lot of inexpensive, unbuilt land nearby on Zillow — you can get 42 acres for $30,000. But make sure to check with the local ISP first.

Shallotte, NC

Population: 4,287

Gigabit ISP: ATMC ($85.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $198,921

Shallotte is about halfway between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and close to the coast. The town punches above its weight in terms of shopping and dining, as it’s the major commercial destination in its county. Golf is a big deal here, with 39 golf courses nearby.

Shiner, TX

Population: 2,169

Gigabit ISP: GVEC.net ($99.95/month)

Zillow Home Value Index: $183,208

A cute, compact small city, Shiner is best known for its Spoetzl Brewery, home to Shiner Bock beer. According to CultureMap Dallas, Shiner is rich in Czech-German heritage, with a “richness of culture” that extends into food and music traditions as well as its world-renowned brewing.

Taos, NM

Population: 5,971

Gigabit ISP: Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (service coming soon)

Zillow Home Value Index: $166,368

Taos is a legendary artists’ colony, home to a motley collection of former city folk who decided they wanted a small-town, hippie-artist vibe. New Mexico Magazine lists 25 reasons to love Taos. The local Kit Carson Electric Cooperative currently offers 250Mbps service, but it says a gig is coming soon.

127,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/technophile/riversong-motive-plus-smart-watch-wearable-review-price-specs/article31518280.ece,"Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",BusinessLine,"Riversong Motive+: Affordable, functional and durable","Known for its IT accessories and audio products, Riversong, which is the subsidiary of Chinese IT major IMG Technology, recently entered the smart wearables market with its Motive series of smartwatches and Wave fitness band. The company also makes a watch for kids, Jelly. Riversong enters the smartwatch market at a time when the sector is witnessing brisk action and brands of all hues are vying with each other to control the wearables market, which has been growing exponentially.

In the current scenario, three important factors hold the key to a smartwatch making the cut in the crowded market — affordability, functionality and durability. Clearly, priced pocket-friendly, the Motive+ smartwatch, which we have under review here — ticks the first criteria. The Motive+ costs ₹4,999 (online stores offer handsome discounts).

The watch has an ergonomic design which is appealing and comfortable. It comes packed with features. It has a full touch screen, health monitor and multi-sport modes, to start with. The body looks premium and feels light on the wrist. The Motive+ has a zinc alloy chassis with a 2.5D tempered glass front panel, which doesn’t attract scratches or finger marks easily. The watch comes with a smooth and strong strap which hugs the wrist tightly but it doesn’t leave marks on the skin.

Smooth touch

The Motive+ comes with a full-touch display with a 1.33-inch IPS screen. Even though the makers claim the Motive+ has a pin-sharp resolution display, all we can say is the display does its job neatly. Nothing more or nothing less. The touch experience is smooth and the device’s response to touch is quite impressive given the price. The dial interface is a bit old-fashioned and the icons and numbers could have been better-looking. But that can be fixed via an update. The Motive+ gives you the option to customise wallpapers, but to be frank we didn't find the available lot very appealing. The rectangular face has a master button on the left which is easy to locate and operate on the go. The dial’s colour reproduction looks a work in progress but you’re not going to miss much there as all you’d be doing is to check for time and fitness data counts in numbers and not exactly messages or notes.

The watch can be paired to your smartphone quite easily using Riversong’s dedicated app. The app allows for a clutch of features such as syncing with Google fitness data and allows for real-time analysis and further tweaks. One of the most striking features of the Motive+ watch is the accuracy of its sensors. The sleep tracker, for instance, does a great job of recording and analysing your sleep and offers the data for further analysis. The watch also offers blood pressure and blood oxygen monitors, which are usually premium features in wearables. The heart-rate monitor does a superb job given the price. When compared with professional medical data — which we did — the watch offers a dedicated and reliable performance.

The watch can take your calls and messages once connected to the phone via the app. The messages are a little difficult to read, though. The phone allows you to control music playback on your phone, which is a blessing if you are working out or jogging hands-free. The watch can be used to control the camera on your phone. The process takes a little effort from the user’s side; still, it is worth your time and effort. The Motive+ is water-resistant (IP67 protection) but not exactly water-proof, so you must exercise caution while swimming. It resists water drops and sweat pretty efficiently. The Motive+ has very impressive battery life. It’s like ‘charge it and leave it’. If you are not using multi-sports modes and other heavy features and stick to basic functions, the watch’s power can last long.

In sum, considering factors such as ease of affordability, durability and functionality, the Riversong Water+ is a truly value-for-money wearable thanks to its smooth and innovative features, near-premium looks and stable performance.

Price: ₹4,999

Pros: Strong body, lightweight, smooth performance, energy efficiency

Cons: Not water-proof, sad-looking faces, touch response can get slower at times","Known for its IT accessories and audio products, Riversong, which is the subsidiary of Chinese IT major IMG Technology, recently entered the smart wearables market with its Motive series of smartwatches and Wave fitness band.

Best known these days for its range of big-screen TVs, Sharp has also released a number of excellent soundbars, with the new SBW800 adding immersive Dolby Atmos to the line-up.

The soundbar itself forms part of Sharp's Home Theatre range, and includes upward-firing speakers for the overhead effects, while a wireless subwoofer handles the bass. The resulting system is designed to produce an expansive wall of sound to perfectly complement the big-screen TVs that Sharp has been pioneering for nearly a decade.

The lack of rear speakers means you can't expect the full surround experience in the way that you get it from the likes of the Vizio 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos Soundbar, or the Samsung HW-Q90R from our list of the best soundbars, but those cost more, and the Sharp really impresses with what it has brought to the table.

Sharp HT-SBW800 Dolby Atmos Soundbar Review: Price & Features

The Sharp HT-SBW800 is very well-priced at £449. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos decoding is clearly a big selling-point, and crucially this cutting-edge object-based audio format is achieved using actual overhead channels – as opposed to the less effective psychoacoustic processing found on competing soundbars from Sony and Panasonic.

The soundbar itself boasts no less than seven speakers: three facing forwards, two firing upwards, and two at the sides to give the soundstage greater width. The upward-firing drivers literally bounce sounds off your ceiling to create the overhead effects – so the lower and flatter your c ceiling, the better the results.

The included downward-firing wireless sub generates low frequencies to 40Hz, and there’s a total of 570W of built-in amplification to drive the entire system.

The SBW800 can handle any flavour of Dolby and also decodes DTS, but doesn’t support the more immersive DTS:X. Whether that’s a big deal really depends on your viewing habits.

If you stream most of your content, it’s irrelevant because Dolby dominates, but if you’re a fan of Blu-ray discs then the lack of DTS:X might be more of an issue. In terms of other features, the Sharp also includes a number of Dolby sound enhancements and four sound modes.

Sharp HT-SBW800 Dolby Atmos Soundbar Review: Sound Quality

The Sharp HT-SBW800 delivers an enjoyably expansive soundstage that extends above and either side of your TV. The bigger your screen, the more effective the performance feels, although anyone looking to beef up their TV audio is sure to be pleased by this capable soundbar system.

Thanks to the soundbar’s width there’s excellent separation between speakers, and thus some very good stereo imaging. This makes the SBW800 a great performer with music, with the drivers retaining a clean mid-range and clear treble at the high-end. The inclusion of a dedicated centre speaker also ensures that dialogue remains clear – no matter how busy the mix gets.

The subwoofer is nicely integrated, supporting the overall soundstage with layers of bass. This gives gunfire and explosions a seismic thump that makes action scenes more visceral. However, the low-end is also tight and fast with music, giving drums a precise percussive kick.

Dolby Atmos soundtracks are handled well, and effects are placed with precision around the front of the room. The upward-firing drivers certainly work, bouncing sounds off the ceiling and creating the illusion there are speakers above you. However, the effectiveness of this approach does depend on your ceiling – the lower and more reflective it is, the better.

While the overall performance is good, this system is limited due to the lack of actual surround channels. As a result the soundstage is very front heavy, with all the effects being localised in the first third of the room. This is an inherent limitation of any soundbar that doesn’t have rear speakers but, unlike some manufacturers, Sharp doesn’t offer an upgrade path to add them later.

There is a surround-sound mode, which is accessed via a dedicated button on the remote, but this just applies processing to give the audio greater openness. It doesn’t add any genuine rear channel effects, and often makes the sound more echoey. There are also dedicated bass and treble controls for fine-tuning the overall performance.

There are a number of sound modes that apply preset equaliser settings to the audio. These modes are fairly self explanatory: Movie adds more bass; Music emphasises two-channel; News prioritises the centre channel for dialogue; and Night compresses the dynamic range, which is handy for not waking the family during a late-night streaming binge.

Sharp HT-SBW800 Dolby Atmos Soundbar Review: Design & Usability

The Sharp HT-SBW800 is understated but elegant in its design, with curved edges and a simple black matte finish. There’s a metal wrap-around grille, and grey end-plates where the side-firing silver-coloured drivers are located. The overall engineering is very good, and at 4kg the soundbar certainly feels like a product that’s solidly built.

A width of 120cm makes the SBW800 a good match for larger TVs, but at 10.5cm high you’ll need plenty of clearance to place the bar in front of the screen without blocking it. Alternatively there’s the option of wall-mounting, and Sharp includes brackets and screws for this purpose. You’ll also find an HDMI cable and 3.5mm audio cable in the box, which is handy.

The downward-firing subwoofer sits on sturdy rubber feet that provide a good degree of support and isolation, and at the rear there’s a bass port for added low-end impact. The sub’s design mirrors the soundbar, and the two should pair automatically when you first set them up. If they don’t, there’s a pairing button at the rear of the sub.

There are some basic controls on the top for power, source and volume up/down. There also a proper LED display that clearly shows useful information such as the source, volume, audio format and sound mode. It makes a refreshing change from no display at all or a complex combinations of lights that has you reaching for the manual in frustration.

All the connections are located in a recessed area at the rear, and here you’ll find two HDMI inputs and an HDMI output with ARC and CEC. All these connections support 4K and HDR, including Dolby Vision, and the inclusion of ARC allows you to send audio back from a compatible TV (including Dolby Atmos from supporting apps).

Two inputs is pretty good for this price – the upcoming Sonos Arc doesn't include any HDMI inputs at all! – so you not only don't lose an HDMI port from your TV when connecting this, you actually gain an extra one.

Other connections include coaxial and optical digital inputs, a 3.5mm auxiliary input, and a USB port. There’s also Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless music streaming, but no Wi-Fi, smart assistants or remote app. However, Sharp does include a well-designed remote control that’s comfortable to hold and easy to use, with all the buttons intuitively laid out.

The HT-SBW800 is extremely easy to setup: simply place the soundbar in front of the TV and choose between stand or wall mounting. Just make sure nothing is blocking the upward-firing speakers in the top of the ‘bar. Then locate the sub at the front of the room, while avoiding corners, and remember that although it talks to the soundbar wirelessly, you still need to plug it in for power.

Sharp HT-SBW800 Dolby Atmos Soundbar Review: Verdict

The Sharp HT-SBW800 certainly delivers on its promise of enhancing your big screen experience, with a powerful and expansive sonic performance. The Dolby Atmos ensures the soundstage is suitably immersive, albeit with the caveat that it’s very front heavy.

There’s no real surround presence, and sadly no option to add rear speakers – so if you’re looking for full immersion for a mid-range price, you might be better off with the Vizio 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos Soundbar and its wired surrounds.

If you don't care about Dolby Atmos at all, we'd suggest the cheaper Sonos Beam as your starting point, and you can add two Sonos One SL speakers as rear speakers for surround when you're ready.

However, people primarily buy a soundbar is to beef up their TV’s audio instantly without running cables all over the lounge, and it that sense the SBW800 is a winner – this delivers fancy 3D audio features that are a noticeable upgrade for movie soundtracks but still keeps things simple.

It’s easy to setup, has plenty of connections, and includes an intuitive remote control. It also boasts an informative display, which is something of a luxury these days. The lack of DTS:X support is a disappointment, although not an issue if you primarily stream, but otherwise this is a cracking soundbar system.","The Sharp HT-SBW800 is the first Dolby Atmos soundbar from a company that’s changed hands more times than a property in Monopoly in recent years.

129,https://harrisees.wordpress.com/2020/05/11/lime-washing-the-house/,"Mon, 11 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",stopthefud,Lime Washing the House — an Affordable Alternative to White Paint,"A while back I had lime washed the inside fire place. I used a product that comes in a bucket in the form of a putty, by a company called Romabio. It was a great product, but cost prohibitive–$250 for four gallons. To be fair, it’s concentrated, so you have to mix it with water, which extends the product. But it’s still pricey. I bought a quart for about $30, and it provided two coats, which was just enough to finish the fireplace. At four quarts in a gallon, that’s going to be several buckets of this stuff to do my house, and that’s not realistic for me on my budget.

Whitewash versus paint: But then I saw some videos of people talking about how cheap it was to white wash their houses. Some were just mixing white paint with water to get a wash look–but I wanted to avoid paint on the masonry. There are ways to paint masonry, but it’s not as simple as buying a bucket of exterior latex and going for it. Masonry, like brick, has to breathe. Coating it with latex is asking for problems. You can google for more info, but basically any water gets between the brick and the paint, and you have problems. The benefit of white wash is that it also breaths. It’s just crushed limestone that adheres to the brick and creates a hard exterior lime coating that bonds with the masonry. It also has a lot of helpful features–such as repelling mold and mildew that can accumulate in dark, damp areas of the house.

So, it’s overall better for masonry, lasts longer than paint, and if you’re into white in a masonry house, it’s really an easy decision.

Affordability: So, how were people doing this affordably? Well, in the days before Romabio, people just bought a big bag of crushed lime, mixed it with water, and made their own wash. It’s easy peasy. And a heck of a lot cheaper. I bought 50 pounds of hydrated lime (for masonry, not garden use) for barely over $10. It mixes at 3 cups lime per gallon of water. It makes a thin, milky wash, and 2/3 of a bag did a single coat over my 1675 sq ft house–an average bungalow.

Requirements:

A string of cool, dry days

1 – 50 lb bag lime

Water

Long rubber gloves

White wash brush (sometimes called “masonry” or “asphalt” brush)

Hose

Ladder suitable to reach the top of your masonry

bucket

bucket hook (if you are using an extension ladder)

Rope / tarp (if you need to protect or move landscape plants away from the walls)

Sponge (to clean up windows/surfaces afterward)

Weather: First of all, you need good weather conditions. For me, in Texas, that meant not too hot and sunny, and not too humid–definitely not raining for a few days straight. I was lucky in spring to have a few weekends that met these conditions. This past weekend it only reached a high of 80F, and mornings were 50s and 60s. It’s unlikely that any weekends that follow will have those conditions, since we’re heading into summer.

Landscape: I had some landscape plants to move on one wall. I tried two processes. I wrapped one in a tarp, tied a rope around it, then anchored it away from the wall using a rebar stake. While it worked, the plant, which normally hugs the wall, still hasn’t snapped back against the wall. But it did move the plant out of the way. The other method I used was to pull the plant to the side with rope–tying some limbs to others to move them away from areas I wanted to paint. It meant adjusting the plant multiple times to work around it, but the benefit is that this one snapped right back up against the wall. Unlike paint, you don’t really have to worry about whitewash getting on plants, it will wash off.

Safety: There were some notes about lime being caustic. I think that’s a relative term. I have worked with Jasco stripper and lye (for soap making), so to me, caustic means something pretty angry. But I’d say if you take reasonable precautions, you should be fine. Don’t rub it in your eyes, don’t drink or eat it, be sure not to inhale when you mess with the powder (or wear a mask or do it outside in an open area), and you should be fine. I used rubber gloves–the kind you use for normal housework. I wore my glasses. I did get splatter in my face a few times, and it was only when it hit directly into a naked eye that I had any discomfort. I did get a few drops in my mouth now and then. It tastes bad, but it wasn’t horrible.

I will add one cautionary tale, though. The wall of the house where I had landscaping, I had scraped up my arm on some limbs trying to prep the plants. Even with long work gloves on, I still had an exposed area of arm, because I was in short sleeves. White wash is a sloppy job, and I got some wash/powder on my arms from generally doing the work. The arm where I had no scrapes was fine. But the one with scrapes eventually developed an ugly, burning rash. I took a shower after the work was done, but it really didn’t help much. This morning I soaped the arm up pretty good and let it set for a bit. Then I applied alcohol–which burned significantly. I’ll live, but it’s not pretty. Here is what I’m talking about–my “good” arm, and my arm that developed the rash:

So, beware broken skin when working with it. Or maybe just go long sleeves if it’s not too hot outside.

Also in the “safety” area, I should note that this stuff splashed around. That includes ladder rungs. So, be careful when climbing, and clean the rungs if they accumulate too much white wash. It can kind of putty up after you get too much on it, and it’s a bit slimy.

Also, good spot to mention the bucket hooks. If you have an A-frame ladder with a tray, you’re probably fine. If you don’t have a tray or are using an extension ladder, then you want to have a bucket hook. Otherwise, you’re going to be wrangling a bucket, brush, and not falling off a ladder–which is totally not worth it, since you can get a bucket hook for under $5 at a hardware store. Just get one. It’s a hook that goes over a ladder rung. It’s attached to a short chain, and the other end is a clip that attaches to the bucket handle. You hook it to the ladder, and it hangs to the side. It really is the difference between a nightmare scenario and peace of mind.

Cleanup: Clean up is, overall, a snap. Windows wipe right off with a sponge and water, because whitewash doesn’t adhere well to nonporous surfaces, like glass. Clothing–just drop it in the wash as normal. Comes out clean. It won’t harm plants. It’s not toxic, since it’s just crushed lime. And if you get it on masonry–like the driveway–just use a hose on “jet” setting to clean it off before it dries. You may get some staining still, so if it’s stone or masonry and you really don’t want to risk a stain, then cover it with something.

I think the toughest part was cleaning the ladders. I used the hose, but really need to wipe them down with something abrasive (like the back side of a scrubber sponge) to get the lime off them.

Process: The process is simple.

Prepare your masonry. Don’t power wash, just use a hose on “jet” to clean off any dust or dirt. Use a cleaning brush (not wire) if needed. If you have any organic matter on your masonry–use a 50/50 bleach/water mix to spray on it. Scrub it in. Let it set. You can also use 50/50 white vinegar and water. I alternated–cleaning off one before applying the other, since vinegar and bleach don’t mix well. White wash won’t adhere well to surfaces with sap or moss or mildew. So, do your best. I did it with my chimney, and wrote about it, to give you an idea. I didn’t get it entirely as clean as I wanted, but I did as much as humanly possible before giving up and trying to whitewash it. Fingers crossed. It seems OK for now, but I’ll have to see how it weathers. I noticed that window sills and shaded areas were more prone to this issue. This is probably the most difficult step. It could take a few days of just spraying on the bleach, scrubbing it in, leaving it a few hours, rinsing it off–at one point I sprayed bleach and just left it on overnight. Again–just do your reasonable best.

Mix the white wash. Three cups powder per gallon of water. Some recipes online say to add salt, but I saw some sites saying that could actually damage some modern surfaces. So, I just did straight up white wash based on a test paper I read that talked about durability of different mixes on different surfaces. I think it was some group in Australia? But just use the lime and water, and you’re fine. I got a big bucket with a sealing lid at the hardware store, but you can use any bucket. The sealing lid is good if you are going to try and save the wash wet. So, when I would work multiple days on this over a weekend, I could stop any time, and just pour the wash I was using back into the big bucket and save it. I could also mix a big batch and then pour it into the smaller bucket to work with. Be sure to keep stirring it, because the lime will settle at the bottom like silt. I sometimes poured it from bucket to bucket to mix it. But when I was “painting”–I would use the brush to keep stirring it as I was applying it. Keep it mixed.

Apply the wash. Before applying it, wet your brick (not soaked, but sprayed so it’s not dry). It helps it apply more evenly, and it’s also supposed to help it adhere. This was the one step I kept overlooking for some reason. I’d prep and get up to the top of the ladder–maybe even start washing. And then I’d think “Oh crap! I forgot to wet the wall.” Down the ladder. Wet the wall. Up the ladder. Start again. I have no idea why I had such a mental block about this step.

Then just keep moving along your wall, doing more and more, till you’re done. It won’t look like anything when you put it on the wall initially, but it will dry out and turn the surface pale. Once it cures for 24 to 48 hours, you can see what it’s ultimately going to look like. If you want it lighter, you add another layer–wetting the surface and adding more wash–just like you did with the first application. It gets lighter with each coating. Here is mine after one coat. It took me about 4 days total to do the house.

These are the “after” photos on top below. I’ll add the “before” images after these. Note that you can see some vertical lines of white on the larger surface. This is where I moved, painting from top to bottom. The white lines are where my sections overlapped. I had to remove the downspouts to paint under them, and I did two coats in those areas so I could put them back up and be done with them. The second coat will help to hide these sorts of mistakes, since it will appear mostly just white at that point. Also note that my trim is white and my door is blue. I hired some folks to come out and repair and paint the soffits, trim and doors. I think in the future I’ll do it myself and save some money. Now that I have the extension ladder and bucket hooks, it seems more do-able for me.

And here are some photos of my house “before”–taken at some old Halloween time of year.

To me, the house looks brighter and cleaner. It pops now. And I think after the next coat of lime wash it’s going to be even prettier.

I hope this helps. And I hope I’ve remembered everything important above. But if you have questions I can help with, please feel free to ask. It was actually fun once I got going. Just the mildew, landscaping and chimney were a bit of a chore and sometimes a little intimidating.

I will also post to let folks know how it holds up to the weather–especially rain. But I think after a good hot Texas summer, that stuff will be baked on pretty good. Oh, and that reminds me: Living in a hot climate, having the house white may help me out on the energy bills, by keeping the place a bit cooler.

At any rate, take care, and thanks for reading.","Whitewash versus paint: But then I saw some videos of people talking about how cheap it was to white wash their houses.
Some were just mixing white paint with water to get a wash look–but I wanted to avoid paint on the masonry.
White wash is a sloppy job, and I got some wash/powder on my arms from generally doing the work.
So, be careful when climbing, and clean the rungs if they accumulate too much white wash.
So, I just did straight up white wash based on a test paper I read that talked about durability of different mixes on different surfaces."

Countries such as China, Russia, India and Cuba are developing and distributing their own COVID-19 vaccines, marking a biotechnology milestone for many of them. Here's a closer look at how they're doing it and what that means for the world, including Western countries such as Canada. Which countries outside Europe and North America are furthest along in developing COVID-19 vaccines? The highest-profile members of this group include Russia and China. The Sputnik V viral-vector vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Russia, and the inactivated vaccines from China's Sinovac and Sinopharm have already been ordered, donated or used in dozens of countries around the world. On May 7, the World Health Organization approved one of Sinopharm's vaccines for emergency use, paving the way for distribution through UN programmes. India's Bharat Biotech has also developed an inactivated vaccine, called Covaxin, that is in use in India. The company has also signed deals with firms in the U.S. and Brazil to produce versions of the vaccine domestically, pending approval. China, Russia and India all have other vaccines in late-stage clinical trials. Other developing countries with vaccines in late-stage trials include Cuba, Kazahkstan and Iran. Is this a surprise? Yes and no. Most people can't think of any time they've used a vaccine developed and exported by one of those countries, since ""there haven't been products like that,"" said Achal Prabhala, co-ordinator of the accesIBSA project, a campaign to improve access to medicines in India, Brazil and South Africa. But many nations have built up the necessary infrastructure and expertise to develop their own vaccines, and weren't expecting easy access to vaccines developed in Europe and North America, which richer countries have been criticized for hoarding. A man flashes a victory sign after getting a shot of the Sputnik V vaccine for COVID-19 in La Paz, Bolivia, in April. The Russian vaccine and Chinese vaccines are the only ones available in many parts of the world.(Juan Karita/The Associated Press) U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba and the high cost of vaccines would make it difficult for the country to import any, said Helen Yaffe, a lecturer in economic and social history at the University of Glasgow who has studied and written about the development of Cuba's biotechnology industry. She said the country has produced its own vaccines for decades. ""They had the capacity,"" Yaffe said, ""but they also, arguably, had the need."" Why are some of these vaccines controversial? 1. They were used for mass vaccination before clinical trials were complete. Russia was called ""reckless"" and criticized by health and science experts in Western media when the country became the first to approve a COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use last August — before Phase 3 trials of Sputnik V had even started. It subsequently gave the vaccine to tens of thousands of health-care workers, teachers and military personnel before Phase 3 trial results were released. WATCH | Growing recognition of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine: But it wasn't the only country to use emergency approval to start vaccinating local populations before Phase 3 trials were complete — China, India, Kazakhstan and Cuba did the same. Prabhala, who is based in India, thinks domestic use by these countries before Phase 3 results may be justified during a deadly pandemic, given that vaccine developers typically know whether a vaccine is safe and whether it shows promise for protecting against a disease by the end of Phase 2 trials. 2. They haven't released or published enough data and ran trials differently. Colin Funk, an adjunct professor with Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., and a biomedical consultant with Vancouver-based Novateur Ventures, co-authored a paper in the journal Viruses earlier this year with another Novateur consultant, Craig Laferriere, comparing all the front-running vaccines around the world. Empty vials of the Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines fill a container at Tecnopolis Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in April.(Victor R. Caivano/The Associated Press) Funk said in an interview that it's been hard to get reliable information about the Chinese vaccines because most haven't published the results of clinical trials. Sputnik V's Phase 3 clinical trials were published in The Lancet in February, but results were hard to compare to other vaccines due to differing methods, Laferrière told CBC News. Sputnik V was recently rejected by Brazilian regulators. Meanwhile, the reported efficacy of Sinovac's vaccine varied from 50.4 per cent in Brazil to 91.25 per cent in Turkey. Some experts have said the lower efficacy in Brazil may have to do with the different protocols and virus variants in the population — even participants with very mild symptoms were tested for COVID-19, unlike other trials, and there was a highly transmissible P1 virus variant circulating. WATCH | Few people in China receive COVID-19 jabs despite vaccine development there: Prabhala thinks the fact that the trials were run in different countries under different conditions was actually a good thing. ""I think they provide a sort of independent third-party analysis of the vaccine itself, and in a very real way for me, they give me more confidence than having one corporation release one set of data based on one very tightly controlled trial that it ran itself."" However, he said, ""I wish we could see little more detail of what the data looked like."" 3. There may be biases rooted in culture and politics. ""In general, there's incredulity at the idea that you could have original science that could work anywhere in the world that comes out of a place not in the West,"" Prabhala said. This exists even in non-Western countries, he said. He suggested Russia and China may face higher levels of mistrust than other countries ""because of the autocratic nature of the state and sometimes the justifiable anger that people feel at the state's human-rights violations."" But those aren't relevant to the actual performance of their vaccines, he said. ""I think the question with any of these vaccines is: do they work and are they effective?""

(Ramon Espinosa/Pool Photo via AP) How important are these vaccines for global immunization efforts? They've already been a big part of vaccination campaigns in their home countries. Vaccines from China and Russia have also been used in dozens of other countries around the world, many of which have limited or no access to other options. Chinese vaccines have made up tens of millions of doses delivered in Brazil, Turkey and Chile, Nature reported this week. In Brazil, vaccination of the elderly was linked to a quick decline in mortality compared to unvaccinated age groups, local researchers report in a study that hasn't yet been peer-reviewed. Meanwhile, in Europe, Hungary and Serbia have much higher COVID-19 vaccination rates than other countries on the continent. Prabhala said that's because they both ordered, evaluated and approved vaccines from Russia and China. A box of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine is prepared for patients in Saint Margit Hospital in Budapest, Hungary, in April.(Zoltan Balogh/MTI via AP) The reach of the Chinese and Russian vaccines could increase with a listing for emergency use by the World Health Organization — something one of Sinopharm's vaccines has already achieved. The WHO recently found Sinovac's vaccine was effective but the company didn't provide enough data, while Sputnik V has been submitted for WHO review. A WHO listing would allow their use by UN agencies, worldwide distribution through the global vaccine-sharing initiative COVAX and use in countries that don't have the capacity to do their own regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, Yaffe says Cuba's vaccines bring hope to populations in the global south. ""If they wait for the big pharma companies for vaccines, then it could be many years until they have the possibility of being vaccinated,"" she said. Prabhala said more options are better for everyone — even richer nations that have secured deals with some manufacturers. He noted that Canada's initial vaccine rollout was off to a slow start compared to countries like the U.S. and the UK, largely due to manufacturing delays at both Pfizer and Moderna. ""I would imagine, therefore, that had Canada had a wider choice of vaccines available ... the rollout would have been smoother and faster and would have given the country and its people much more security.""","CBCCountries such as China, Russia, India and Cuba are developing and distributing their own COVID-19 vaccines, marking a biotechnology milestone for many of them.

131,https://allafrica.com/stories/202005290273.html,"Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AllAfrica - Top Africa News,Zimbabwe: Sanitary Wear Must Be Affordable,"Sanitary wear must be made available and affordable, while education about menstruation and stigma around the biological process must continue, First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa has said.

Amai Mnangagwa said this yesterday during her interaction with 50 children drawn from disadvantaged backgrounds during the commemoration of the Menstrual Hygiene Management Day.

There have been major concerns from young girls and women over the soaring costs of sanitary wear.

Amai Mnangagwa, through her Angel of Hope Foundation, donated reusable menstrual kits to the disadvantaged women.

The reusable menstrual kits are being manufactured by Angel of Hope Foundation. Amai Mnangagwa's goal has been to promote menstrual hygiene management.

The First Lady said it was saddening to note that while pregnancy was a celebratory topic, menstruation was considered as a dark phase which was supposed to be dealt with secretly.

""Talking about menstruation, it is considered taboo and yet it is the biological indicator that pregnancy has not occurred,"" she said.

""This silence contributes to the ignorance and illiteracy on menstrual hygiene management.

""Regressive socio-cultural norms pertaining menstruation are responsible for the silence around the issue of menstruation and this results in the use of unhygienic products to manage periods instead of much safer products.""

The First Lady noted that the Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) Day was being marked in the middle of the Covid-19 global pandemic, adding that menstruation was every woman's issue and it was important to take time to reflect on the process which is part of reproductive health for women and girls.

""The theme for this year's commemoration is 'It's time for action. Indeed it is a time for all of us to take action and address the challenges that women and girls face in relation to menstrual hygiene management, especially as we also look at the challenges that we are currently facing due to the Covid-19 global lock down,"" she said.

""Menstrual hygiene management is not a girls and women's issue alone, but it is a matter that concerns all of us as communities and failure to manage menstrual hygiene may as well impact on the development of communities and the nation at large.""

The First Lady said it was time to break the silence, raise awareness and change negative social norms around menstrual hygiene management and make concrete commitments at local and national levels.

""We should note that a little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause grievous bodily harm, and may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others,"" she said.

While Menstrual Hygiene Day is recognised each year on 28 May, the First Lady said it should not only be limited to this day.

""We must ensure that education about menstruation and the removal of the stigma around this biological process continues to occur on a daily basis and efforts are enhanced in making sanitary wear affordable to both women and girls,"" she said.

Earlier on, Amai Mnangagwa had taken time to educate the children about Covid-19 where she said they must protect themselves, their families and the community from the killer pandemic.

She urged them to treasure and focus on education, saying it was the pathway to success.

The First Lady gave the children's guardians an assortment of foodstuffs that included tea, maize-meal, rice, sugar, laundry soap and cooking oil.

The girls thanked the First Lady for the kind gesture.

Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo in a speech read on his behalf by Mr Sydney Makarawo said menstrual hygiene management was of key concern to his ministry and the commemoration of the day was an opportunity for the nation to reflect on the biological needs of women and girls.

""Our Government is committed to implementing rights enshrined in Section 56 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe (Amendment number 19) which provides a strong framework for the protection and promotion of the rights of women and men, girls and boys,"" he said.

""Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is therefore a critical aspect of the rights of women and girls and demands our urgent attention.""","Sanitary wear must be made available and affordable, while education about menstruation and stigma around the biological process must continue, First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa has said.

When it comes to gaming peripherals, a few big names come to mind. However, there are plenty of other brands and plenty of choices when it comes to gaming keyboards, mice, and other peripherals. In the past, I’ve much preferred heavier mice, however, there seems to be a trend towards lighter mice, especially for gaming. Our Glorious Model D review takes a look at a very light gaming mouse from a company you may not have heard of. Around since 2014, the Glorious PC Gaming Race gaming was created to “create unique gaming accessories, engineered for premium quality and elite-level performance, sold at everyman prices.” Read on for our full review and see why it earned a Top Pick of 2020 here at Techaeris.

Design

At first, I was a bit skeptical about the design of the Glorious Model D gaming mouse. There are a few companies that make mice with hollowed-out shells but this is the first I’ve used. The Model D has your typical mouse design with split left and right mouse buttons that go back to about the midway point of the top of the mouse. The buttons are split by a clickable scroll wheel and the DPI button. On the left side of the mouse are two buttons that default to forward and back Windows functions.

Where the Glorious Model D differs from most mice is the HoneyComb Shell that has hexagon honeycomb cutouts in both the palm rest and the bottom half of the mouse buttons. It actually looks kind of cool and allows you to see inside the house. The main reason for the cutouts, of course, is to lighten up the mouse. Excluding the cord, the Model D weighs a mere 68 grams. It’s not the lightest gaming mouse you can get, but it is lighter than most.

Save Top view of the Glorious Model D gaming mouse.

I did think that the honeycomb cutouts would be uncomfortable during use as the mouse palm rest isn’t smooth. Honestly? I didn’t even notice the difference, but I did notice the difference in weight.

As for LED lighting, the mouse has LED rings on either side of the scroll wheel and on the top of each side, just below the top pieces. The hollowed-out buttons and palm rest actually help to show more of the LED glow, especially in dimmer lighting conditions. Just behind the side buttons is the Glorious PC Gaming Race bearded-man icon in grey. The Glorious wordmark is also in grey near the right front of the mouse.

The bottom of the mouse is where you’ll find the Pixart PMW-3360 Optical Sensor, DPI indicator LED, and four skates (one in each corner of the mouse). It is a bit odd that the DPI LED indicator is on the bottom but to be honest, you’re likely not switching up DPI too often without being able to quickly flip the mouse over and verify what your current DPI is. On that note, if you know what your settings are, you’ll be able to tell based on your mouse cursor movement.

Glorious included two larger skates as well which apply easily and stay on securely, for an even larger bottom skate surface. They are easy to install, simply remove the 3M backing and place the top or bottom skate accordingly. Once in place, there is also a thin plastic covering which needs to be removed. While the mouse works well enough with the default skates, having the option to add a larger skate surface does make a difference as well.

Save Bottom view of the Glorious Model D gaming mouse with extra skates.

Our review sample also came in white and I anticipated it getting dirty quickly. However, after almost a month of daily use for upwards of 8 hours a day, the mouse still looks generally clean overall. Perhaps that’s partly due to the constant hand sanitizer being used these days… At any rate, the white is actually a nice colour and seems to hold up fairly well to dirt and grime. It does wipe down easily as well if it does get dirty. If white isn’t your preference, you can get black as well and both colours are available in matte or glossy finishes.

The Ascended Cord braided cable on the mouse is not only long (roughly 6 1/2 feet) but it is super flexible and soft. Not only is it flexible, but it also doesn’t tangle and it is super lightweight as well.

Overall, the Glorious Model D is comfortable and very light. As I mentioned, I was a bit skeptical of the design but after using it for a few weeks, I rather do like it.

Ease of Use

The Model D gaming mouse can be used as-is out of the box. Of course, if you do, you’ll be limited to the default button bindings and 400/800/1600/3200 DPI settings. If you want further customization, including LED lighting control and macro setup, you’ll want to download the Glorious Model D Software app for Windows.

Software

For full control over your Model D settings, you’ll definitely want to download the software app. Once you’ve installed it, you can remap the six available buttons, including macros, set profiles, control DPI settings (up to 12000), lighting, lift-off distance, polling rate (up to 1000Hz), and denounce time.

The app itself is pretty straightforward and easy with everything being on one screen. Re-assigning buttons or creating macros is as simple as selecting the appropriate button and assigning the function, key combination, or macro you want to trigger when using said button.

Save Glorious Model D Software app for Windows screenshot.

On the RGB side of things, there are eight different lighting effects, as well as an LED off setting. Each of the effects offer up something different and, depending on effect, let you adjust brightness, speed, or colour switch.

While you can set up different profiles in the app, there is no onboard profile storage on the Model D itself. This is definitely something that would be nice to have, especially if you have a home desktop setup and a mobile setup like a laptop.

As mentioned, the app is pretty simple but it is straightforward and easy to use.

Performance

As mentioned above, Glorious PC Gaming Race was created to provide high-quality gaming peripherals at an affordable price. The Glorious Model D features Omron mechanical switches, rated for 20 million clicks, and a Pixart PMW-3360 Optical Sensor.

Save The scroll wheel and DPI button on the Glorious Model D gaming mouse.

Based on the materials and sensor used, the Model D does indeed perform as expected. I wasn’t sure I’d like the lighter mouse but it didn’t take long to get used to the lack of weight — in a good way. Movement of the mouse is nice and smooth and, depending on your DPI setting super responsive. Glorious indicates that the Pixart 3360 Sensor is the “competitive e-sports industry standard” and it worked well in all games we tested it with. From MOBAs like Heroes of the Storm to FPS’ like Call of Duty: Warzone and Bleeding Edge, I had no issues with the response of the mouse.

One thing I did notice though, and it is minor, is that the scroll wheel squeaks on occasion. When gaming with a headset on or the speakers on, you can’t notice it but in quieter settings, you can. I did blow it out with compressed air but that didn’t seem to help the issue at all. As I said, it is minor and only noticeable sometimes but it is there — at least in our review sample. Looking at other reviews on the Glorious site, there was only one other that I saw that mentioned the same so it’s likely an issue affecting a small number of mice.

Price/Value

With an MSRP of US$49.99 ($59.99 for the glossy finish), the Glorious Model D is definitely one of the more affordable gaming mice out there. Not only is it reasonably priced, but it ticks all the boxes gamers want checked off with a gaming mouse. It definitely offers great value for the price if you’re looking to switch or upgrade your gaming mouse.

Money Energy

Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), has said that instead of treating carbon dioxide (CO2) as a liability, one can use it as a raw material.

Ambani made these remarks at the FII Investment Institute Conference on ""Don't Forget Our Planet"" on Thursday.

The other participants in the conference included Prince Abdulaziiz bin Salman al-Saud, Minister of Energy, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Patrick Pauyanne, CEO, Total and Tanya Beckett, as the moderator.

Ambani stressed on completing the carbon cycle. ""I think that, where we are, if we take a clean sheet of paper and adopt technologies whereby, we can complete the energy cycle, we can adopt new technologies, particularly biochemical photosynthesis. Instead of treating carbon dioxide as a liability, we can make that a raw material,"" Ambani said.

""There are new progresses in chemical roots, in the catalytic roots, whereby we can still complete the carbon cycle,"" he added.

Ambani said that in the progress that humankind has made between the industrial revolutions, it has disturbed the carbon cycle and now it is time to use technology to reset that balance.

""It's not only imperative for us to be net carbon zero, but I think that we should opt to recycle carbon. I believe that Mother Nature is the best technology and she teaches us how to recycle,"" he added.

""We've forgotten the carbon cycle; His Highness reminded us about that, and I think that Saudi Arabia in the G20 summit has put this on the global agenda. We have to adopt technologies and I think that for us in the energy business, it is not so much about the decarbonisation, but it is really about completing the cycle,"" Ambani said.

""And I think that renewables, or clean fuels, business is a very simple framework and energy is an essential requirement for all the people on this earth. There is a need to provide efficient, clean and affordable energy. And we have to do it in a responsible way. That's the business. We should not confuse that between clean and unclean,"" he said.

""I don't think that just one solution will fit all. The important thing is to allow energy equally. That means, everybody has to have access to clean energy for their quality of life at an affordable price. And the purpose of industry is prosperity of all the people,"" Ambani said.

""For us, particularly in India, we have high growth, so it is important that one works with the consumer in spreading the awareness,"" he said.

The RIL CMD said that real touch with the community, understanding the community on the ground level and understanding different sectors of the economy and getting them involved in the energy movement is critical for restoring the carbon cycle.

Ambani believes that synthetic biology is the key to powering a clean planet, according to a report in Forbes. Reliance is moving directly into synthetic biology's convergence of biology, computing and automation.

""Biology in the next 20-30 years will lead the world,"" Ambani said recently, as per the Forbes report.

Reliance showcased how its synthetic biology programme, comprising 150+ scientists and researchers, recently developed an ""algae to oil"" technology that takes carbon dioxide waste from the refinery, and combines it with algae and sunlight to produce bio-crude oil that could one day fuel the carbon-neutral air travel.

Reliance was early to recognise the potential of algae as a sustainable, clean biomanufacturing platform.

""Just as we brew beer from yeast, we can make just about anything from medicines and food to next-generation bioplastics and fuels from algae,"" the report said.

Reliance is also using advances in gene editing to significantly improve the production capacity of algae. It is spearheading several algae-based projects, including one turning organic waste into kerosene and aviation fuel — a.k.a. ""waste to wealth"".

By using algae to make bio-crude and other chemicals, it mitigates traditional production techniques that take the carbon of fossil fuels out of the ground and put it into the atmosphere, further contributing to the alarming rise in greenhouse gas emissions, the Forbes report said.

But Reliance's efforts are about more than supporting a clean environment.

Santanu Dasgupta, who leads the biology R&D at Reliance, said that the new bioeconomy -- driven by synthetic biology-- is a way to uplift India's economy, much of which is built on agrarian society.

The report said that with agricultural feedstocks as the basis of a new bioeconomy, Dasgupta thinks Reliance can uplift India's rural communities along with its biotech sector.

Dasgupta has also said that the process of bringing people together across cultural boundaries to explore how synthetic biology can improve people's lives around the world isn't going to happen overnight, ""but it's a process that we must start now,"" the Forbes report said.","Mukesh Ambani pushes for clean and affordable energy, tech to recycle carbon dioxideSpeaking at the FII Investment Institute Conference on ""Don't Forget Our Planet"", Ambani said it’s imperative to adopt tech that can recycle to set the carbon balance right.

The icemaker will be based on solar-driven diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) technology, which boils a fluid in one compartment by using heat from low-cost solar-thermal collectors and condenses it in another to generate a cooling effect. DAR devices are known for their simple and silent construction, and lack of moving parts, which promise low costs, excellent reliability and long lifetimes. This makes them ideal for rural communities without access to electricity.

In response to the award Professor Markides said: “The Chill Challenge award will enable us to deliver an exciting solar-cooling solution for icemaking in developing, remote or off-grid regions. We are delighted to continue our long-standing interaction with Solar Polar, and look forward to the opportunities that will arise from this project”.

The Chill Challenge initiative was launched in September 2019 to solicit innovative proposals for more affordable refrigeration for off-grid communities, which has the potential to improve the lives of millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet.

Proposals were submitted by 43 teams from 36 universities around the world and shortlisted by a distinguished panel of reviewers, including EWB-USA volunteers and international refrigeration experts. Seven finalist teams were awarded grants ranging from $30,000 to $50,000 to develop their projects.

139,http://www.businessworld.in/article/Affordable-And-Reliable-Electricity-To-All-Customers/05-06-2020-194339,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",BW Businessworld,Affordable And Reliable Electricity To All Customers,"India, is the third largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity. But it still has one of the lowest per capita power consumption (1,181 kWh) as compared to the world’s average per capita power consumption, which stands high at nearly 2,700 kWh. Because of this, our nation faces the challenge of ensuring sound financial health of the power sector, which is currently dealing with a unique challenge, wherein there is surplus power generation capacity but adequate distribution infrastructure is lacking. This leads to lower utilisation of power plants and increased losses in power distribution sector, which brings in liquidity stress in the sector.

The country is currently grappling with the effects and impact of COVID – 19 hurled across sectors in these trying times. As power comes under essential services and is exempted from the effects of the nationwide lockdown, the utilities across the country have strived to providing interrupted supply to all customers. But due to nationwide lockdown the industrial consumption has been subdued leading to average Plant Load Factor (PLFs) of thermal power plants declining to 56.08 per cent for FY20 compared to 60.30 per cent for FY19. Apart from this the sector now faces an aggravating problem of poor financial performance of Distribution utilities (DISCOMS), which are now faced with dual challenge of subdued demand from Industrial & Commercial customers and lower collection efficiency during the lockdown. It is now imperative to address these issues at earliest to boost the economy.

One such development to ease the ongoing menace, is the structural reforms proposed, through the announcement of the Draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. This Bill has reinforced the spirit of Electricity Act, 2003 and has suggested measures for the development of the sector. The key focus lies on promoting competition, protecting interest of consumers and universal access to electricity, tariff reforms, transparent subsidy management and promotion of renewables. The key initiatives are the reforms towards cost reflective tariffs, shift towards a Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) mechanism for transfer of subsidies to customers, more powers to the Distribution Franchisees and Distribution Sub-Licensees player which will be now recognized by the regulator and notification of a National Renewable Energy Policy. All these measures, if implement effectively, has the potential to transform the electricity sector in India and usher in socio-economic development for the citizens.

In order to make the reforms more effective, certain recommendations can be taken into consideration by the Ministry of Power. This will play a big role in introducing competition and bring in technology & innovation in last mile electricity service to provide clean, affordable and reliable electricity to all citizens.

Provisions for promoting Decentralized distributed generation

The idea of introducing decentralized distributed generation systems will pave the way for innovation in rural remote areas and help in providing affordable and reliable electricity to all customers, through integration of off grid and grid electricity technology.

Providing model structure, detailed guidelines and roles & responsibilities of Distribution Sub- Licensees

Distribution Sub-licensee can add an interesting dimension to the industry structure in last mile electricity distribution supply and can empower the customers. This mechanism if implemented with full effectiveness can bring in multiple players operating in the same licensee area offering, the much needed, electricity service choice to customers. It also offers a huge scope for bringing in newer players into electricity supply business who can leverage technology and bring in novel customer centric practices in electricity service. To make the concept of Distribution Sub-licensee effective, the model structure, detailed guidelines and responsibilities may be clearly defined,either in the Act or in the subsequent guidelines issued by authorities.

Guidelines on Distribution Franchisees

Currently, different models and terms & conditions are being followed for the appointment of distribution franchisees across states. This has in turn led to mixed outcomes of success and failures of the franchisees. To increase competition, the distribution franchisee agreements should be drafted in a manner, so that the risks and incentives are aligned to provide a win-win proposition to Discom, Private sector and Customer. A similar initiative has been taken by Ministry of Power in the past, wherein a standard set of business models and bidding documents, was provided that served as an effective guidance to States for adopting distribution franchisees in the states.

Provisions for promoting Smart Grids

Introducing Smart Grids and associated technologies e.g. smart meters and grid resilience will attract investments in technology and innovation, that will contribute to providing affordable and reliable electricity to all customers.

Undoubtedly, India has made massive gains in the power generation sector, to the extent ofbecoming a power generation-surplus country. But the battle is far from over. To achieve its aim to ensure 24x7 power supply to all, the government needs to focus on developing a sustainable and robust transmission and distribution network as electricity is the driver of India’s development goals.

It is also critical to keep tariffs at optimum levels to benefit rural citizen of the country. At the same time, the government also has the 225GW renewable energy mission which, again, will depend on the creation of a robust, cost-effective network. So, while the government has been quick to act, by introducing structural reforms through this Amendment Bill, the effectiveness depends on implementation of the measures by the states, which is a challenging task .

This amendment bill has the potential to transform the electricity sector in India and now is the opportune time – On one hand, promoting renewable energy to achieve 175 GW target by 2022 and on the other hand introduce reforms to make the last mile electricity distribution supply viable. Together, the country now has potential to meet SDG-7 Goal of providing affordable, reliable, and modern energy services to all citizens.","This leads to lower utilisation of power plants and increased losses in power distribution sector, which brings in liquidity stress in the sector.

140,https://www.archdaily.com/940711/solar-lighting-for-an-affordable-sustainable-future,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ArchDaily,"Solar Lighting for An Affordable, Sustainable Future","While first developed as a practical power source during the 1950s, solar systems were too expensive for mainstream use until the 1970s. Starting from their early use to power Cold War era military satellites, silicon photovoltaic solar cells achieved their first commercial success in places where electricity was not available, such as lighthouses and off-shore oil rigs.

To transform light from the sun into usable energy, photovoltaic cells harness an electric current created by electron flow between the layers of silicon in the cell, which is activated by sunlight. Solar panels typically consist of 36 to 72 photovoltaic cells, and the panels themselves can then be connected to create a solar photovoltaic system for larger installations. Excess energy can be stored in batteries for later use. The solar energy industry is constantly evolving in the efforts to make panels smaller, more efficient, and more affordable.

Today, the image of solar power is evolving from an alternative to traditional energy sources to being viewed as a cost-effective solution. Installation of solar powered lighting does not require the complicated infrastructure, trenching, and wiring expenses necessary for electrical hookups. Long-term maintenance and operational costs are reduced through the use of easy-to-clean panels, electronic components, LED luminaires, and recyclable batteries.

The environmental benefits of solar lighting are considerable as well. Drawing upon natural light, solar power is an emission-free, infinitely renewable resource that reduces your carbon footprint. Because solar lighting does not have to be connected to the electrical grid, minimal physical disturbance is required for installation, making it ideal for parks, sacred sites, and environmentally-fragile land. Solar lighting may also be helpful in achieving various green building certifications.

While at this time there are no LEED credits specifically relating to solar lighting alone, it can instead be a useful strategy for contributing to multiple LEED goals. Relevant credits may include light pollution reduction, optimizing energy performance, renewable energy production, and more. Green Globes criteria include measuring and decreasing energy consumption and protection of sites, both of which could benefit from the minimally invasive nature of solar lighting. The Living Building Challenge, as well, includes standards for energy reduction and net positive energy.

Incorporating solar design into architecture is becoming more common as the profession looks forward to increasingly sustainable buildings. Designers worldwide are looking to minimize the amount of energy used by their buildings, often leading to the inclusion of either (and sometimes both) passive and active solar design systems. Solar power is less susceptible to changing energy prices, providing for future savings compared to other power sources. Also in the face of a natural disaster or other loss of power, solar lighting is a reliable source of light.

Paired with LED lights, solar is practical for areas requiring illumination for personal safety, including parking lots, paths and trails, and remote sections of a property. It is ideal for temporary needs, ranging from construction sites to a security backup in areas where underground wiring requires replacing or is prone to copper theft.

Installation of off-grid solar lighting systems is quick and easy, requiring minimal tools and equipment. A project can be completed in days compared to the weeks required to install traditional electrical wiring. As many systems are pre-configured to connect together, general contractors and existing work crews are able to complete most installations without an electrician on-site.

Solar lighting is an increasingly attractive option when it comes to servicing construction sites, powering remote areas, increasing personal safety at night, and combatting rising electricity rates. AEC Daily’s course on off-grid solar lighting systems will show you the benefits of this technology as a flexible, environmentally friendly, and affordable lighting solution.

The course outlines the main parts of a complete solar lighting system: photovoltaic solar panel, charge controller, battery, and LED driver/LED fixture. There are detailed descriptions of each of these elements, explaining how they function and provide maximum energy efficiency. You will learn how to calculate array-to-load function, and discover why a bigger battery isn’t necessarily a better one. The flexible control options of LED fixtures are discussed, and how to match them with the other system components. Advice is offered on what to look for in a supplier, along with several case studies of systems in action.

The grant programs encourage collaboration across local agencies and nonprofits, and include strong encouragement of quality public engagement to find ways to reduce driving and greenhouse gas emissions while supporting housing and transportation needs.

“We are thrilled to make these awards to high-impact projects by deserving applicants,” said SGC Executive Director Louise Bedsworth. “All four programs – Transformative Climate Communities, Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities, Climate Change Research, and Proposition 84 Wildfire Resilience and Recovery – are highly competitive; nevertheless we saw many more qualified projects than we were able to fund. We are inspired by efforts across California to build healthy, thriving, resilient, and equitable communities.”

Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Grants

Details on the grants in this program can be found here [PDF]. They include affordable, transit-oriented infill housing, clean transportation options, transit improvements, electric buses, bikeways, sidewalks, and the like, throughout the state. Staff highlighted projects in Imperial, Coalinga, Ridgecrest, Arcata, Santa Rosa, and Riverside as examples of “how low-VMT development can fit into local contexts, particularly in areas without histories of dense, transit-oriented development.”

Not everyone was pleased with the outcome of the awards. In particular, a number of commenters from San Diego complained that, given the circumstances of the region, it may never be able to compete effectively against Los Angeles and the Bay Area in this program.

Those circumstances include sparser transit access – so increasing the ridership numbers as much as other regions is a big lift – and the relative lack of disadvantaged communities as defined by the state.

San Diego is unhappy because it submitted five applications, and none scored high enough to get funding in this round. The planning process for these applications is intense, so the feeling that they wasted their time was strong. SGC staff was concerned about this, and had spent some time trying to figure out how to give some of the program’s discretionary funding to San Diego. However, according to the staff report, “awarding such funds in San Diego County would result in AHSC missing its statutory objective of awarding fifty percent of funds within Disadvantaged Communities.”

Several commenters at the meeting asked the Council to revisit the list of grants, and to consider revisiting its scoring criteria to include some measure of geographic equity. Circulate San Diego delivered a letter arguing for geographic fairness, pointing out that the city has made big changes recently but needs more of an incentive – like the ability to compete – to really shift its priorities.

As it is, 44 percent of the money went to the San Francisco Bay Area, about 40 percent to the L.A. area, and about 14 percent to the San Joaquin Valley.

The real problem is that the AHSC is a small program that tries to do everything. It works well as an example of what can be done, but it is too small to be relied on as the only state funding program for affordable housing. However, as Lourdes Castro Ramirez, Secretary of the California Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency, pointed out in a press release from the SGC, these grants “are the single largest allocation of affordable housing funding currently available in California.”

These grants, the fifth round of AHSC grants, awarded over $550 million to 26 projects, which between them will build 2,563 housing units near transit, the majority of which will have deeply affordable rents. They also include pedestrian freeway overpasses, safe routes to schools programs, bicycle corridor plan implementation, transit route optimization, low-income community transit service expansion, commuter rail expansion, transit passes for residents of the affordable housing developments and surrounding communities, environmental justice and activism programming, bicycle education workshops, zero-emission car sharing, and workforce training programs.

Did someone mention that the program is trying to do everything?

TCC Planning Grants

Also yesterday, the SCG awarded $600,000 in planning grants under its Transformative Climate Communities program, for three cities out of the ten that submitted applications. In this third round, the cities of Porterville, San Diego, and Pomona will each receive $200,000 for community planning.

The Porterville Unified School District will partner with several local government and nonprofit partners to develop a ten-year Climate Action Plan for Porterville Schools.

In San Diego, the Environmental Health Coalition, a local nonprofit, will work with residents, nonprofits, and the city to conduct community engagement and planning for the Barrio Logan and Logan Heights neighborhoods, focusing on affordable housing, urban greening, and climate-resilience education and engagement.

The city of Pomona will work with local partners on planning around expanding clean, convenient, and affordable transportation options and affordable housing.

TCC Implementation Grants

The Transportation Climate Communities program was also set to award $56.4 million for two implementation grant awards of about $28 million each. Because cap-and-trade auctions – the source of funding for these grants – have tanked as travel and emissions have plummeted along with the economy, the SGC only awarded about $42 million.

The SGC received four applications, and decided to award one full and two partial awards.

In Oakland, the Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors: An East Oakland Neighborhood Initiative will get $28 million for community engagement, displacement avoidance, and workforce development efforts. The collaborative effort between Black Cultural Zone, Planting Justice, and East Bay Permanent Real Estate Collaborative will include increasing housing through the production of ADUs, creating jobs, adding community greening, and creating a community bike maintenance program with the help of Oakland Scraper Bikes.

In Riverside, the Eastside Climate Collaborative’s TCC application overlapped with the city’s application for a grant under the AHSC, which it got; therefore, the total grant to Riverside was less than the full amount, about $10 million, with the rest of the needed funding coming from the AHSC. The Riverside project includes affordable housing, pedestrian and bicycle improvements, a mobility hub expansion, solar installations, and urban greening.

Awarding less to Riverside allowed staff to give a partial award to Stockton, for Stockton Rising. That project will include a complete streets project on Miner Avenue, acquisition of zero-emission buses, urban forest renovation, and workforce development.

More Grants

It was a long meeting, but the SGC wasn’t finished. The council also awarded its third round of climate research grants, giving out almost $5 million for six grants to California universities and research institutions working on energy, air quality, ecological restoration on tribal land, outdoor cooling, farmland, local development, and community solar storage. Details can be found here [PDF].

The last group of grants was $720,000 in Wildfire Resiliency and Recovery Planning Grants for planning support to communities affected by catastrophic wildfires. Those went to the cities of Paradise and Moorpark, and the counties of Ventura and Sonoma.

A shift from Africa’s traditional approach to power generation is needed to unleash the continent’s clean energy potential and secure an African future free from blackouts. A strategy centred around energy storage and flexible power systems will be the key to guaranteeing the reliability of a high-renewable grid, while also lowering the cost of electricity for Africans.

As Africa’s economies and populations steadily grow, so too does the demand for reliable electricity. Simply put, new power plants need to be built, and the reliability of electricity systems needs to be vastly improved. But here is the challenge: How can African countries build an electrical system that can both integrate a large amount of inexpensive but intermittent renewable energy, while at the same time ensure resiliency for the continent’s blackout-prone grids?

This is where energy storage and flexible power plants come into play. Storage enables the integration of renewable energy on a large scale, bringing energy innovation to address the challenges presented by this developing energy hotspot.

Coping with the intermittency of renewables:

Africa has one of the greatest untapped solar energy resources in the world, and with so much sunlight available, the cost of solar energy generation in Africa could easily be among the lowest in the world. But the road to get to considerable renewable energy integration could be bumpy. Most, if not all African countries, suffer from weak electrical grids, plagued with chronic power shortages and blackouts across the continent. And the social and economic ripple effects of a complete nationwide loss of power are not to be underestimated. Along with the growing demand for energy, the voices for more resilience against power disruptions also become louder.

Although renewable energy is increasingly affordable, its variability also remains a problem: the wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine. But the grid is built in a way that requires a consistent and equal balance between electricity supply and demand to function properly. Rising electricity demand and the increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy resources introduce an extra layer of complexity to the job of grid management.

Currently, old traditional power plants have been managing this balancing act with varying degrees of (un)success. Coal or gas turbine power plants don’t have the flexibility to be switched on and off quickly, as required in response to shifting weather conditions or due to grid stability challenges. As Africa aims to integrate economical solar energy at a large scale, the inability of current grid capacity to respond to energy demand is likely to worsen unless we tackle the need for flexibility head-on.

Grid congestion as the primary cause of blackouts:

The design of electricity networks in Africa has left utilities vulnerable to grid congestion issues that threaten reliability and cause blackouts. Grid congestion is a daily problem that occurs when the electricity system cannot carry enough energy to meet the demands of consumers or cannot distribute the “excess” energy. With the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources—such as solar and wind—this challenge becomes exacerbated on high renewable production periods, cloudy days or when there is no wind, potentially resulting in blackouts.

As such, energy storage technologies offer a game-changing solution for Africa. They have the unique ability to provide a buffer between supply and demand, enabling energy systems to rebalance during and after a disturbance. Moreover, storage can charge and discharge energy as required on demand, making it a key piece of the stable energy infrastructure needed to improve grid reliability and security in Africa.

There is no question that energy storage will play a central role in providing reliable electricity continent-wide. Relying on storage as the only form of flexibility, however, could be too expensive in the near-term. Wärtsilä has identified that the lowest-cost, shortest path to a high-renewable electricity system also requires smaller flexible-generation plants. These include small, rapid-start engine power plants that can flexibility switch on and off in minutes and which can run on natural gas now and on renewable-derived fuels as it becomes cost-competitive and more widely available in the future.

Renewable energy will be at the heart of any significant energy transformation in Africa, bringing economic and environmental potential to the continent’s consumers and communities. Energy storage and flexible power plants will be its key enabler. The benefits are vast. Not only can utilities remove the expensive need to over-build energy infrastructure to ensure there is always enough power to supply to customers, they can also future-proof power generation supply, bringing the century-long age of the blackout to an end.","Op-ed by Risto Paldanius, Business Development & Proposals Director, Energy Storage & Optimisation, Wärtsilä Energy Business.

Affordable decarbonisation of rural businesses and industries

Thousands of businesses in rural areas have been badly affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, and could face further hardship as a result of the upcoming recession. Many of these businesses need large amounts of space and process heat, such as hospitality or tourism facilities, food-processing industries, or farms. These industries, situated off the gas grid, will increasingly be required to switch from high carbon and pollutants energy sources; however, their options for decarbonisation are limited. Now more than ever, economic recovery measures should facilitate their transition to affordable and lower carbon solutions.

Heat for industrial processes in rural areas

To help Europe achieve climate neutrality, the European Commission has identified clean gas-based technologies as a solution for meeting its more ambitious targets. This is the case especially for rural industrial users whose processes require continuous heat supply; something that is not easily replaceable with intermittent renewable electricity for technical reasons and costs. The reality is that local businesses and SMEs in rural areas still rely on some of the most pollutant fuels, such as heating oil and coal.

RELATED CONTENT

Today, while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of these companies will face major job losses, and risk being overlooked as they are located in less densely populated areas. They need realistic low-carbon alternatives now for the near and mid-term to help them recover and modernise. Therefore, EU and national policymakers should dedicate funding to recovery measures for rural areas, to help facilitate the switch to more efficient and affordable heating solutions that offer immediate carbon and air pollutant emission savings.

Future-proof solutions for rural businesses beyond the gas grid

With support coming from recovery plans across Europe, rural entrepreneurs should be encouraged to cut their emissions and invest in efficient and low-carbon thermal systems. Examples of such systems are fuel cells or engine-based cogeneration, gas heat pump and hybrid systems like an electrically driven heat pump with a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) boiler, or a thermo-solar installation. By using low-hanging fruit like LPG, we can bring about a sharp drop in the share of diesel and solid fuels and an increase in the share of renewables in areas where gas infrastructure is not developed. Importantly, the resulting efficiency gains would also increase these businesses’ competitiveness, while lowering their heating costs.

""The reality is that local businesses and SMEs in rural areas still rely on some of the most pollutant fuels, such as heating oil and coal""

Rural businesses should be able to choose cost-effective routes to deep emission reductions. For example, switching from an oil or coal boiler to an LPG one can reduce emissions respectively by 25 percent and 50 percent. LPG produces fewer air pollutant emissions and is therefore better for our health. Similarly, NOx emissions from LPG are 40 percent lower than heating oil and 75 percent lower than coal. In these areas, the possibility of using local and decentralised heat and power generation systems, for instance through cogeneration, would bring major benefits including complementing the electricity grid capacity, cutting emissions and reducing the energy consumption of these businesses.

By switching to LPG, a Scottish single malt whiskey distillery, Tamnavulin, operating since 1966, was able to reduce their costs, while lowering their NOx emissions by about 65 percent and to cut carbon emissions by almost 20 percent. Similarly, a study commissioned by Liquid Gas Europe suggests that inn owners, using a typical building built before 1918, could largely benefit from a switch from an old oil boiler to a new gas engine-driven heat pump fueled by LPG (bioLPG in the future). Together, with insulation of the building to increase its energy efficiency, such a hotelier could save almost €2,000 annually on energy bills and cut their carbon emissions by 86 percent over a lifetime.

A stationary fuel cell unit can transform LPG into hydrogen to produce heat and electricity. By changing an old oil heating system to a fuel cell unit, fuel consumption drops on average by 60 percent as the amount of gas required is equivalent to only one third of the previous oil consumption. This leads to a reduced carbon footprint and lower energy bills for the end-user.

With a renewable drop-in substitute, like bioLPG, existing industrial and commercial users of LPG do not need to invest in new appliances or upgrade their installations tomorrow to switch to a renewable alternative. BioLPG is a renewable solution that can provide an up to 80 percent lower carbon footprint compared to conventional LPG.

""With support coming from recovery plans across Europe, rural entrepreneurs should be encouraged to cut their emissions and invest in efficient and low-carbon thermal systems""

Businesses in rural areas need dedicated support

The preparation of EU economic recovery plans, combined with the ambitious objectives from the European Green Deal, presents us with a unique opportunity. The time is right for the EU to demonstrate in practice that the energy transition will leave no one behind, and that this applies to businesses in rural areas too. We, therefore, call on the EU and national governments to include a rural chapter in the upcoming economic recovery plans. This should include measures to redirect some of the financing mechanisms from EU investment and structural funds to support cost-efficient solutions like fuel-switching and modernising energy solutions for rural businesses.","Affordable decarbonisation of rural businesses and industriesThousands of businesses in rural areas have been badly affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, and could face further hardship as a result of the upcoming recession.

Affordable housing developer Chelsea Investment Corp. announced Tuesday that construction will start soon on 195 apartments for low-income families and seniors in the Mid-City area of San Diego.

The project is located at 4340 44th Street near the corner of Fairmont Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard and across the street from the Copley-Price Famly YMCA.

The $81 million development will consist of two five-story buildings above underground parking. One building will provide 78 two- and three-bedroom apartments for families, while the adjoining building will offer 117 one-bedroom apartments for seniors

Chelsea is leading the development on behalf of Price Philanthropies Foundation, which donated the land and contributed key funding, along with the San Diego Housing Commission. The nonprofit Serving Seniors is also a partner on the project and will provide comprehensive on-site services for both the senior and family apartments.

“When we acquired the land at Fairmount and El Cajon in 2009, we knew that its strategic location on El Cajon Boulevard could, with careful planning and design, be the place of a transformational community-oriented development,“ said Robert E. Price, president of Price Philanthropies Foundation, which seeks to improve life opportunities for youth and families in San Diego.

“After facilitating the development of the Copley Price Family YMCA in 2014, we wanted to ensure access to stable, quality affordable housing in Mid-City,” he added. “We are excited to see 195 units of family and senior housing available in the community at rates that ensure accessibility.“

The 1.6-acre project will include an inter-generational garden, dedicated dog area, and a town square outdoor plaza. Architectural design is led by Rob Wellington Quigley Architects.

Rents for the family apartments are expected to range from approximately $1,200 to $1,600, while rents in the senior building will range from approximately $750 to $1,200. All units include central heating and air, fully-equipped kitchens and window coverings.

The project is scheduled to open in mid 2022. Approximately six months prior to the completion, prospective residents can register their interest online.","Architect’s rendering of the family apartments planned for the site.

148,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/06/24/affordable-hydrogen-fueled-flight-possible-in-2035/,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",pv magazine International,Affordable hydrogen-fueled flight possible in 2035,"Helsinki airport installed rooftop PV to offset some of the climate impacts of flying. An EU study has now highlighted the great potential for fueling aircraft with hydrogen to do the same.

Under normal circumstances, Europe’s skies would be packed right now with aircraft jetting people from the drizzly north of the bloc to the beaches of the south, with an attendant, hefty carbon footprint.

If hydrogen could be used to fuel air transport, a study by the European Union has found, the climate effects of aviation could be reduced by 75-90%.

The European Commission, EU research program Horizon 2020 and trade body Hydrogen Europe commissioned management consultants McKinsey & Company to produce the Hydrogen-powered aviation: Preparing for take-off study.

Short-haul

Short-haul flights with low passenger numbers could be the first to become hydrogen-fueled, wrote the authors of the report, with such a move adding only around 10%, or $5-10, to passenger costs. Hydrogen use in that aviation segment could occur within eight to 15 years, the study stated, pending technological breakthroughs, certification and standards, and new infrastructure.

Ticket prices would rise around 30-40% for medium range flights, according to the study, as the larger fuselages required to store liquid hydrogen would lead to 25% more in-flight energy consumption.

With long-haul hydrogen flights costing passengers 40-50% more per ticket – due to more onerous design demands – the use of synthetic fuel, or synfuel, may be a more practical route to decarbonizing such journeys for now, the report found. Design innovations such as stealth-bomber style ‘blended wings’ could bring down hydrogen-related flight costs but will require at least another 20 years of development, according to the EU report.

Cost efficiency

The authors of the study said the hydrogen costs per abated ton of CO 2 equivalent would be less than $60 for regional and commuter flights and $70-220 for short and medium-range journeys. “This compares favorably to $210-230 per ton CO 2 equivalent for synfuel-form direct air capture for short to long-range aircraft,” stated the report.

Bart Biebuyck, executive director of the Fuel Cells & Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking formed by the European Commission, Horizon 2020 and Hydrogen Europe, said: “The cost of producing clean hydrogen came down in recent years thanks to cheaper renewable electricity and bigger and cheaper production technology. At the same time, fuel cell performance in terms of durability, capacity and cost has made big steps forward. This combination has now made it possible to look to such solutions for decarbonization of the aviation industry and the results of the study are clear on the huge potential of hydrogen in aviation. The hydrogen and fuel cell sector is ready to work hand in hand with the aviation industry to design, test and produce the required components and make zero-emission aviation an everyday reality.”

Popular content

The report also explored the use of hydrogen as a combustible liquid in revamped jet engines, using it in fuel cells for electricity production and recombining it to synthetic fuels. The study found using hydrogen as a combustion liquid would lead to a climate impact reduction of 50-75% as non-CO 2 emissions such as NO x and water vapor would continue to contribute to global warming. Fuel cell-based power would prompt climate impact reductions of 75-90%, and synthetic fuels 30-60%. The study claimed fuel cell propulsion offered the best economics, except on long-haul flights.

Quantifying impact

Aviation produces 900 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. With an industry growth rate of 3-4% per year before the onset of Covid-19 and efficiency improvements playing catch-up at just 2% per year, the sector’s CO 2 emissions were set to double by 2050. Incrementally deploying hydrogen aircraft in the segments where they are the most cost-efficient means of decarbonization would see 40% of all aircraft hydrogen-powered by mid century, with the balance synfuel/biofuel-powered, to prevent the emission of 2.7 gigatons of CO 2 .

The report’s authors recommended a target of making all short-range flights hydrogen fuel based by 2035 and called for research into liquid hydrogen fuel and propulsion components, aircraft systems, infrastructure and regulatory requirements, to achieve that goal.

Work to do

“Research and innovation is vital to realize the full potential of hydrogen technologies for [the] decarbonization of aviation,” said Patrick Child, European Commission deputy director-general for research and innovation. “The EU’s future Horizon Europe research and innovation framework program is a fantastic opportunity to advance this agenda, working in partnership with industry and the research community. The excellent co-operation between the existing joint undertakings dedicated to hydrogen fuel cells and clean aviation illustrates the need for close synergies between the two sectors as we work together on the ambitious objectives of the post-Covid recovery and the European Green Deal.”

Sustainability In May last year, pv magazine launched the UP sustainability initiative. Our goal is to dive deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable, looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. In addition to quarterly themes on issues such as lead in solar and green finance, we have looked at biodiversity, sustainable flying and raw material sourcing for batteries. Read more, stay tuned and get involved! Check out our quarterly themes and UP coverage to date.

The innovations required to make hydrogen flight a reality include a need for lighter, more efficient fuel tanks, with a target of 12 kWh/kg and a gravimetric index of 35%, and fuel cell systems targeting 2 kWh/kg. Jet engines capable of burning hydrogen with low NO x emission are also needed as well as systems for safely handling liquid nitrogen. Industry insiders speculate such advances could be achieved within 5-10 years, according to the EU study.

The question also remains as to where the hydrogen necessary would come from. With Europe currently generating just under 10 million tons per year of the global 78 million, transforming just short-haul flights to the new fuel would drive an estimated 40 million-ton hydrogen market by 2050.","An EU study has now highlighted the great potential for fueling aircraft with hydrogen to do the same.
If hydrogen could be used to fuel air transport, a study by the European Union has found, the climate effects of aviation could be reduced by 75-90%.
Hydrogen use in that aviation segment could occur within eight to 15 years, the study stated, pending technological breakthroughs, certification and standards, and new infrastructure.
This combination has now made it possible to look to such solutions for decarbonization of the aviation industry and the results of the study are clear on the huge potential of hydrogen in aviation.

Cape Town-based IMPower has developed a market-leading medium-sized solution comprising of solar and energy storage technologies for the commercial & industrial market, which includes business parks, factories, shopping malls, schools and many others, providing reliable, affordable power.

Energy storage technologies are viewed as a potential game-changer for widespread adoption of renewable energy generation throughout Africa. They facilitate the management of renewable power intermittency, demand response services and the dispatchability of stable, clean and sustainable power into the local or national grid system.

“Our energy solution combining solar and energy storage provides a maximum benefit solution for the market, ensuring security of supply and significant cost saving, especially with the recent tariff increase,” says Chief Executive Officer, Jay Naidoo. “Companies are forced to consider alternate energy solutions and the hybrid combination of solar and energy storage provides a perfect solution for any energy user, be they large or small.”

The deployment of renewable energy is not only driven by cost efficiencies and environmental awareness, but when coupled with Battery Storage, a new dimension emerges where utilities are able to compete on a level playing field with conventional electricity power plants.

Furthermore, energy storage remains a flexible, scalable and efficient solution. Energy storage thwarts the need for power utilities to unearth and replace wires or spend money and time on constructing new plants. As an alternative, they can build a network of battery storage within 6 months.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2035, developing nations will constitute 80% of total global energy production and consumption alike. A greater portion of this new generation will be derived from renewable sources in response to adhering to international policies for cleaner energy.

Energy storage is considered to be the next wave of growth and the international market is expected to grow from $221 million in 2014 to $18 billion in 2023.

Spurred by the adoption of cleaner energy, declining prices and regulatory subsidies; solar photovoltaics, battery energy storage systems and mini-grids are being increasingly utilised across the electric system.

These developments necessitate that utilities adapt their conventional centralised systems into more flexible, integrated and distributed power networks. This movement is evolving from preliminary phases to long-term investments that support the evolution of new business models.","Spurred by the adoption of cleaner energy, declining prices and regulatory subsidies; solar photovoltaics, battery energy storage systems and mini-grids are being increasingly utilised across the electric system.

Metro bond makes its mark in in Old Town Beaverton, promising 54 apartments by the end of 2021.

The first of the Metro Regional Affordable Housing Bond buildings broke ground on Friday, June 26, in Beaverton.

The Mary Ann will have 54 new affordable apartments in Old Town in Beaverton. The developer is REACH, which has built affordable housing for low-income families and individuals in the metropolitan region since 1982. The Mary Ann is REACH's first project in the City of Beaverton.

As is common in coronavirus times, the groundbreaking was shared virtually rather than attended in person by stakeholders.

REACH has been working with the City of Beaverton to identify a project in the city's growing downtown core to meet working families' needs. With the 2018 passing of the Metro Regional Affordable Housing Bond, Beaverton and Metro selected the Mary Ann as one of the first bond-funded projects, committing $3M.

""The Mary Ann groundbreaking is symbolic of the 3,900 homes that will be built using funds secured through the 2018 Regional Affordable Housing Bond,"" said Metro Councilor Craig Dirksen.

In Washington County, 1 out of 4 renters is considered rent-burdened, paying more than 50% of their income towards rent. This new building will help address the high rent burden experienced by a significant proportion of Beaverton's renter households.

""Affordable housing projects like this one are a critical piece in the creation of a vibrant community — providing families of all incomes stable housing close to work and play,"" said Washington County Chair Kathryn Harrington. ""We are grateful to have so many partners at the table, working together to make this a reality.""

With more than half of the apartments containing two or more bedrooms, the Mary Ann will be home to very low-income families with children with incomes at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), with 20% of the units set aside for households at or below 30% AMI. Onsite programs and services for residents will be provided through a partnership with Bienestar. As part of their work, Bienestar provides culturally specific, bilingual services to the Latinx and low-income communities of Washington County.

""Creating equitable opportunities for larger families to live in the opportunity-rich, Old Town neighborhood in Beaverton was a key priority in developing this site,"" said REACH CEO, Dan Valliere. ""With access to affordable transit options, high-quality healthcare, proximity to living-wage jobs, and many community resources, The Mary Ann will be a supportive place to call home where families and individuals can realize their goals.""

The Mary Ann design features 39 parking spaces, a secure bike room, laundry facilities, and a community room open to a large courtyard. The property is within walking distance to the MAX light rail and WES commuter rail, multiple shopping opportunities, grocery stores, Beaverton City Library, post office, restaurants, services, parks, and across the street from Beaverton High School.

""I am proud that our plans for a more vibrant downtown are inclusive and that our city center welcomes community members who need our support most,"" said Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle. ""The Mary Ann exemplifies the type of housing development we need in Beaverton with both affordable and deeply affordable homes and great access to transit and downtown amenities. Increasing the availability and affordability of housing is a key focus area and will remain a top city priority.""

The $22.6 million project is financed with funding from the City of Beaverton's allocation of the Metro Housing Bond, Oregon Housing and Community Services, Business Oregon, Washington County, City of Beaverton grant funds, the Beaverton Urban Redevelopment Agency, and Energy Trust of Oregon. Permanent financing will be provided by the Network for Oregon Affordable Housing (NOAH). Wells Fargo Bank made an almost $12M in Low Income Housing Tax Credit equity investment in the project and is also the construction lender. The Community Housing Fund provided acquisition financing.

The building will be managed by REACH and is designed by Scott Edwards Architecture with construction by Walsh Construction, and construction management by The Klosh Group. REACH is pursuing certification through Earth Advantage.

Construction will proceed during the COVID-19 environment as providing housing is essential, especially during this time when physical distancing is critical. The Mary Ann will take approximately 15 months to complete.","The Mary Ann affordable housing breaks groundMetro bond makes its mark in in Old Town Beaverton, promising 54 apartments by the end of 2021.

Instead of wishing that kids would eat healthy mostly plant-based meals, Arielle Kestenbaum, a Registered Dietitian and certified nutritionist, launched Fare Meals by Arielle, a resource designed to help parents of young kids feed their families nutrient-dense meals on a budget.

Arielle was inspired to create Fare Meals when she worked for an organization that brings healthy plant-based meals into school children in New York City, called the Coalition for Healthy School Food. Her assignment was to teach plant-based cooking to pre-schoolers.

""When the 4-year-olds heard about the vegetables and fruits and dishes they had never tried before some of them were hesitant,"" Arielle told The Beet. ""But after they tried the foods they loved them and I thought, how can I get their parents to feed these meals to the kids? Plant-based food doesn't have to be expensive, or too involved to cook up, so I created Fare Meals so show how easy it is to make food that is healthy and delicious on a budget.""

Every meal on the site has a system of 1 spatula for the fewest ingredients and fastest prep and cook time to 3 spatulas for the slightly more involved time commitment, but everything stays well under 30 minutes. She also coded the price of ingredients the same way using dollar signs. So far the site is launching with a dozen recipes and more food facts -- but the young founder explains that ""I was planning to launch later but then the COVID-19 pandemic started to change the way we think about health and food and I realized people needed this now.""

Each approached the foods with trepidation. They had never heard of some of the vegetables we were introducing, she said. So she set out to help moms and dads prepare and cook healthy meals and make it the new ""fast food.""

A new site, Fare Meals by Arielle

Kestenbaum, 28 is a big propoinent of plant-based eating and wanted to bring her passion to kids who need it most: Those in disadvantaged communities where vegetables and fruits are not readily available, but where healthy eating for kids can mean the difference between a lifetime of health or illness. Plant-based diets have been shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, as well as obesity and certain cancers. There is a misperception that healthy food, and vegetables and fruits specifically, costs more, and Fare Meals was created as a resource to show consumers and specifically parents like those of the kids Arielle taught, that healthy meals can be affordable and easy to make.

How do you get a picky eater to try new foods: You get them involved in cooking

""A lot of the kids I taught at first didn't want to try the food, but I am a big believer in always getting the kids involved in the kitchen. So we would make salsa, which they loved, and cabbage salad, and the parents asked how did you get the kids to eat this?"" The trick, she said, was getting them to make the food. Then they wanted to try it and get their friends to try it too.

""I asked what they eat at home and basically they mostly ate pizza. But they learned a lot about new vegetables, and they were adventurous. They were a lot more receptive than I thought they would be. There is a lot of research to support this--that getting kids to help cook will also get picky eaters to try new things. It's hard, because it makes a mess in the kitchen and it takes longer. But it is great because the kids are home now during COVID-19 and the schools are close, so now is the perfect time to get them involved.""

Arielle saw what the kids were eating and knew that we could do better

When she spent a year with the young pre-schoolers and saw what the kids were eating she knew she could make it better. The kids from the plant-based cooking class would go home and ask their parents for what they had eaten and the parents asked Arielle for the recipes, and Fare Meal was born. She was planning on launching Fare Meals in the late spring, but when COVID-19 she pushed things up to be able to help families whose students no longer could count on school lunch to be there for them.

""I think it's a resource that is really needed,"" she explained. ""The meals are pretty easy. The ones that take five to ten minutes are represented by 1 spatula and the slightly longer prep time is 2 spatulas and then more than 15 minutes are 3 spatulas.""

She hopes to work with local markets to help families get the ingredients they need to create healthy inexpensive and easy meals to combat the idea that healthy has to be expensive. The long-term goal, she said, is to put fast food chains out of business, or at least offer a viable alternative for parents with little time to cook and a tight budget for groceries.

""I want to help as many people as I can, especially during this coronavirus crisis, and to ensure families have access to healthy recipes that are easy, healthy, and affordable.""

""This is a step in that direction, just showing people that they can make really easy but healthy meals at home. The other thing that's important is that these meals focus on being nutrient-dense, so taking foods people love and elevating the nutrition profile.""

Now she is teaching her own son the same values as he learns to eat a variety of plant-based foods. ""I have this book I got from this person at the Coalition and it's called Rah Rah Radishes. And my son is 18 months old and he knows what a rutabaga is and if an 18-month-old can learn these words and love this book then any kid can.","Instead of wishing that kids would eat healthy mostly plant-based meals, Arielle Kestenbaum, a Registered Dietitian and certified nutritionist, launched Fare Meals by Arielle, a resource designed to help parents of young kids feed their families nutrient-dense meals on a budget.

Conditions in her low-income senior building on Chicago's Near West Side — the Congressman George W. Collins Apartments — are ""deplorable,"" she said.

Residents are not wearing masks or gloves to guard against the coronavirus, she said: ""They're touching everything on the elevator, in the laundry room. And anybody and everybody's relatives and friends are coming in and out with no scrutiny.""

No one is checking on residents to see if they need help, Brooks said. And no one seems to know whether residents have tested positive for Covid-19 or died, though ambulances have screeched up to the entrance several times.

""This building is not safe,"" she said in mid-June. ""With all the things happening in the US, this is what 'seniors lives don't matter' looks like.""

Nationwide, more than 1.6 million older adults live in low-income housing subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development — most in apartment buildings with shared common spaces, elevators, staircases, mailrooms, hallways and laundry rooms where the coronavirus might lurk.

Most of these seniors have endured a life of disadvantage, have chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, and lack financial reserves to draw upon.

Yet in the midst of the pandemic, this population — the age group deemed most at risk of becoming critically ill and dying — has largely been overlooked.

""This is a moment when we really should be pushing assistance and guidance toward these senior communities, but we're not,"" said Linda Couch, vice president of housing for LeadingAge, an association that represents nonprofit senior housing and long-term care providers. ""No one is watching over what's happening.""

Nationally there is no data on Covid-19's spread in low-income housing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not collecting it or requiring states to do so. The same is true of HUD and state and local housing agencies: This is ""independent living,"" and operators are not expected to monitor the health of residents.

Low-income housing operators find out about Covid cases only when residents or family members volunteer the information. For the most part, systematic testing is not done. A rare exception: Gov. Andrew Cuomo in mid-May announced plans to bring coronavirus testing to 40 public housing developments in New York.

""Without testing, there's no way of knowing how many people have the virus,"" said Michael Kane, executive director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants. ""Our concern is that there could be a transmission danger similar to what's going on in nursing homes or assisted living.""

""People are dying all over in these buildings, and we don't know what they're dying from,"" said Geraldine Collins, president of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants.

The situation in Chicago highlights how difficult it is to gauge the extent to which people in these settings are at risk. Although the Chicago health department requires "" congregate living facilities ,"" including senior housing complexes, to report two or more confirmed Covid cases that occur within 14 days, it has not made that data publicly available. So there is no way of tracking where the virus is spreading.

The Chicago Housing Authority, which operates 55 buildings with 9,500 senior residents, ""is not required to track or verify cases and, due to privacy issues, we do not inquire about the health status of residents,"" the agency said in a statement.

At the federal level, HUD's emergency preparedness plans did not incorporate infectious disease control and its guidance to housing operators was spotty in the pandemic's early stages. Building managers were not required to notify residents of a Covid case.

Recently, HUD has come out more strongly on the side of transparency. On May 21 , HUD said that multifamily housing management should, ""in coordination with local health officials, communicate the possible Covid-19 exposure to all residents and workers, volunteers and visitors.""

On health concerns, HUD has deferred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in March issued recommendations for preventing the spread of Covid-19 in retirement communities and independent living facilities.

Those include canceling group activities; informing residents, workers and visitors about Covid-19; stepping up cleaning and disinfecting; screening people coming into buildings; and limiting visitors.

Very little of that was happening in Chicago buildings for low-income seniors, according to Lori Clark, executive director of the Jane Addams Senior Caucus, which has close to 700 members.

When the organization called members in mid-March, ""we started to hear awful stories,"" Clark said. Residents reported getting no information about how to stay safe. No one was checking who was going in and out. Buildings were understaffed as workers stayed home.

At the Elizabeth Woods Apartments, a senior building operated by the Chicago Housing Authority, ""we felt abandoned,"" said Carmen Betances, 68. ""They did no cleaning, and they did not prepare the property for the invisible enemy that has now taken over. They gave us no information about what to do.""

""I am a target for coronavirus: I am a senior. I'm asthmatic. I have a compromised immune system,"" Betances said. ""Every breath I take, I take with fear, worrying that I could die from this invisible monster.""

At the end of March, Betances and other residents began using their own cleaning supplies to disinfect the handles of every door in the six-story apartment building twice a day. They wiped down water fountains, counters in the lobby, chairs and tables in the community room as well as vending and laundry machines.

On May 20, the housing authority said in a statement it is making more than 3,000 calls daily to check in on older residents, requiring property management firms to clean and disinfect common areas three times a day, and distributing information about Chicago's six new coronavirus testing sites.

The complex where Brooks lives is privately operated. Its operations were taken over April 1 by WinnResidential, the nation's largest manager of affordable housing.

""The immediate priority during this transition has been to protect the health and safety of the residents,"" wrote Ed Cafasso, senior vice president of WinnCompanies, which owns WinnResidential. He said the complex was now being cleaned several times a day.

Cafasso said the company has helped tens of thousands of older residents at 520 properties obtain meals, groceries, household supplies and masks; renew prescriptions; and access telehealth.

Food assistance is a pressing need, because people cannot get hot meals at community centers and many are afraid to go to grocery stores.

Also needed: help using technology, and better internet connections so seniors can participate in telehealth and virtual interactions with friends and family, easing their loneliness as stay-at-home orders remain in place. Most federally subsidized senior housing lacks building-wide Wi-Fi.

Going into the pandemic, some housing operators were better equipped to respond. In and around New York City, Selfhelp Community Services runs 11 low-income senior buildings with 1,400 residents. Social workers have identified vulnerable residents at the buildings and have stayed in contact with them, said Mohini Mishra, a management director.

""If someone is coming home from the hospital, we try to check in with family members,"" Mishra said. ""Will they need home care? Do they understand what self-quarantine means?""

Across seven of Selfhelp's buildings, there had been 20 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among residents and 12 people had died as of June 10.

At the Paul G. Stewart Center apartments in Chicago, officials called in the police after the first resident found to have Covid-19 in mid-March refused to stay in their apartment.

""We reiterated the guidelines of the CDC and the Chicago and Illinois health department[s],"" said Shawn Person, chief operations officer of the South Side campus, which houses about 1,300 residents. ""But this person refused to listen. We had to do something."" As of June 10, she said, 10 residents had tested positive and two had passed away.

The complex is participating in a federal pilot project that brings nurses into senior housing to help evaluate residents' needs.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

But there's only so much they can do. ""There's a store in this building, and nobody practices true social distancing there,"" said Shirley Moore, 71, who lives in an apartment tower on the campus, has Covid-19 and is not sure how she became infected.

Her 72-year-old husband has a much worse case of Covid-19 than she does, she said. He had been in intensive care for three weeks as of June 10, including eight days on a ventilator, she said, and early on doctors told her they did not think he would survive.

""You go up in the elevators, you're bringing garbage to the garbage chute, you're grabbing a guardrail in the hall,"" she said. ""Even if there's been cleaning, people still will be touching all these places in between.""

As for what she would like to see happen, Moore said, ""I think they should be testing. I'm sure if you tested everyone in this building, you'd come up with a lot of Covid-19.""","Conditions in her low-income senior building on Chicago's Near West Side — the Congressman George W.

154,https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/06/26/Cereal-sales-rebound-as-consumers-sheltering-in-place-look-for-convenient-affordable-breakfasts,"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",FoodNavigator-USA.com,"Cereal sales rebound as consumers sheltering in place look for convenient, affordable breakfasts","According to Nielsen data, breakfast cereal sales rose 35% for the week ending April 25, compared with the year-earlier period. And for the two months ended April 25, they were up 34%.

This uptick has just as much to do with cereal being shelf-stable, and therefore easy to stock in the pantry, as it does with being convenient, affordable and – depending on the selection – nutritious, Arjan Stephens, the executive VP at Nature’s Path Foods, told FoodNavigator-USA.

He explained that the reason consumers are flocking back to cereal “starts with why consumers were going away from it. I think consumers were going away from cereal because they were time-starved.”​

Referencing “sort of fishy and sort of real”​ reports of Millennials skipping breakfast at home because they didn’t have time, didn’t want to do dishes or would rather have something on-the-go, Stephens explained that the pandemic upended these excuses.

With schools closed and many employees working from home, Americans suddenly not only have time, but they face a new set of pressures to prepare every meal at home while also juggling other responsibilities, he said.

'Many people realized that cereal is … convenient and the price per meal is actually quite affordable'

In reviewing their breakfast options, he said, “many people realized that cereal is … convenient and the price per meal is actually quite affordable.”​

And, he said, if strategically selected, they also could be nutritious.

“For a long time cereals had been declining because they were seen as unhealthy and they were sold in the center of the store while everyone wanted to shop the perimeter where they could buy as many fruits and vegetables as possible.""​

But, he said, organic cereals “sort of bucked that trend and were able to stay flat or even grow while some of the big multinational cereal companies faced declines year-over-year for five years or more and, in some cases, actually had to shut down factories and lay off workers.”​

Similarly, Stephens said, “Nature’s Path was able to buck that trend not only because we are organic, but because we put in our products healthy ancient and heritage grains, quinoa, spelt, amaranth, chia seeds and flax.""​

Meeting special dietary needs​

Stephens added that Nature’s Path also avoided the fate of so many cereal brands because it constantly innovates to meet consumers’ changing needs – including increased demand for options that are paleo- and keto-friendly with no grains and little sugar.

“As a general pillar, we have been launching products that are grain-free,”​ including granolas that have performed “extremely well,”​ and the upcoming launch of grain-free hot cereals that are “super unique in that they use coconut and chia seeds and, because they have no grains, use watermelon seed protein powder,”​ he said.

While a hot cereal in the middle of summer may sound odd, Stephens said, “during the pandemic hot cereal sales spiked tremendously – even more than cereal.”​

He suggested that consumers are attracted to the brand’s canisters of steel cut, old fashioned and quick cooking oats “because they are super nutritious. Oats are some of the best things you can eat in terms of cereal grain. They are high in fiber, high in protein, they are great for the heart in terms of soluble and insoluble fiber, and they are really a nutritional powerhouse.”​

As America comes out of the pandemic – or enters a second wave – he said consumers will prioritize nutrition and nutrient dense options, like those offered by Nature’s Path.

Social causes, employee safety are valued attributes​

Consumers also will prioritize supporting brands that support social missions and values with which they can align, Stephens predicted.

“Sustainability and social causes are the number one thing that Millennials and the generation below them are interested in, including climate change, which is a cause that is near and dear to their hearts,”​ as well as employee safety, he said.

Nature’s Path illustrated during the pandemic that it also supports both of these values, Stephens said.

With regards to sustainability, the company launched on Earth Day a limited edition oat-based cereal that was made using organic regenerative techniques.

“We were selected to be one of the first companies to be a part of a trial by the Rodale Institute”​ to pilot regenerative organic farming techniques, Stephens explains. “We own our own farm land, which is unique to a lot of companies, so we were able to grow our oats on our farms using regenerative organic techniques, and … identity-preserve the oats to create one of the first regenerative organic food products in the market place.”​

He added that the company’s adoption of regenerative organic techniques builds on its long-time dedication organic farming and protecting the planet.

With regards to protecting employees, Stephens said, the company illustrated its dedication by continuing to operate during the pandemic but never experiencing an outbreak.

He explained that the company supported employees by providing them with extra paid time off to care for themselves and loved ones, and by paying them a one time $300 “hero bonus,”​ as well as an additional $2 per hour that they worked.

“We have heard of a number of food companies that had to shut down for a month or even permanently because of the condition of their factory workers or the fact that people weren’t treated well in light of the pandemic. And I think the pandemic really shined a light on those organizations that are doing it right and those that haven’t and I think that people are going to vote with their wallets, with their forks and with their spoons to support a more ethical, healthful future,”​ he said.

Looking forward, he added, that he hopes “that our food system becomes more compassionate coming out of this crisis and more thoughtful to the workers, the environment, our health and our society.”​","According to Nielsen data, breakfast cereal sales rose 35% for the week ending April 25, compared with the year-earlier period.
He explained that the reason consumers are flocking back to cereal “starts with why consumers were going away from it.
Nature’s Path illustrated during the pandemic that it also supports both of these values, Stephens said.
With regards to sustainability, the company launched on Earth Day a limited edition oat-based cereal that was made using organic regenerative techniques.
“We were selected to be one of the first companies to be a part of a trial by the Rodale Institute”​ to pilot regenerative organic farming techniques, Stephens explains."

Supporters of the ACA have said that if the health care bill were to be overturned, it could lead to “total chaos” as millions of Americans would lose health insurance coverage. And according to a study from the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, the ACA — which became law on March 23, 2010 — seems to have kept some Americans from going bankrupt.

“Our findings suggest that by more robustly providing health insurance coverage for low-income Americans, the ACA has had some effect on the risk of filing for bankruptcy protection,” the report said. “Although future research is still needed to uncover causal mechanisms on the role possessing health insurance may have on an individual’s ultimate decision to file for bankruptcy relief, ... there is no doubt that the presence of uncovered medical bills can contribute to an individual or family’s financial ruin and ultimate decision to file for bankruptcy protection.”

Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), said that repealing Obamacare would have a devastating effect on families.

“If the law is repealed in the Supreme Court, millions of people, especially those who are ill, could be burdened with new costs or have coverage denied altogether,” Straw told Yahoo Finance. “This would be a catastrophic result for millions of families and comes at a time when people need health coverage more than ever during this pandemic and economic crisis.”

‘A bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds’

The coronavirus pandemic exposed America’s expensive health care system, particularly related to how health insurance is so intrinsically tied to one’s unemployment.

One of the main objectives of the ACA has been to make affordable health insurance available to more people outside of employment. The Obama administration aimed to improve people’s financial security in the face of illness and help “to ensure that getting sick no longer means financial ruin.”

Story continues

In March 2009, the new president told a health care forum: “We must address the crushing cost of health care. This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds.”

And even with the ACA, health care costs were still a growing issue in the U.S. over the last decade.

Total national health care spending grew 4.6% in 2018, reaching $3.6 trillion, according to the latest national health expenditure data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In 2019, approximately 137.1 million adults reported medical financial hardship. A Bankrate.com study from March 2020 found that 1 in 3 families have skipped medical care due to cost, while a Gallup poll found that 1 in 4 Americans said they or a family member postponed treatment for a serious medical condition in the past year because of the cost.

“Several parts of the law are designed to help people avoid large bills,” Straw said. “There is a maximum out-of-pocket cap on health plan charges, including in employer-sponsored insurance, and no annual or lifetime limits on coverage, so your plan won’t cap its payment of medical claims if you face a catastrophic health event.”

The University of Denver study also found a strong correlation between the ACA and a decline in the probability of having unpaid medical bills sent to collections, along with a decline in the probability of needing to borrow money or skip paying other bills in order to pay previously unmet medical expenses.

“It is well-documented that a deep connection exists between family finances and the obtaining of adequate health care and health insurance,” the report said.

ACA impact on debt

Aside from providing affordable health coverage, another key component of Obamacare is the expansion of Medicaid.

As of May 2020, 36 states and D.C. adopted the Medicaid expansion.

A study from Medical Care Research and Review found those states saw improved credit scores, reductions in filing for bankruptcy, reductions in the probability of incurring $1,000 or more in derogatory balance, reductions in the probability of medical bills going to collections, and reduced balances past due as percent of total debt.

In addition, Straw said of Medicaid’s expansion, “people with pre-existing conditions no longer face discrimination when they buy coverage on their own. Whereas before, they could find it impossible to get coverage for the health services they needed the most. And the requirement for individual market insurers to cover all ‘essential health benefits’ means that people won’t face big, unexpected gaps in coverage.”

If the ACA were to be overturned, nearly 20 million people would lose health care coverage, according to the Urban Institute. It’s important to note, however, that this study was conducted before the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. and the country experienced massive layoffs — over 16 million workers are estimated to have lost health care coverage since then.

Although a repeal of Obamacare would cut federal spending by over $134 billion, “the benefits to the public outweigh the costs to the government,” Straw said. “The ACA was fully paid for when it passed. Special interests have whittled away at its financing, but the revenue it raises still pays for its coverage expansion.”

She added that the Supreme Court case on Obamacare “comes when state and local governments are struggling and can’t supplement funding, and hospitals and other health care providers face unprecedented financial challenges and can’t bear the additional cost of uncompensated care from people who are newly uninsured.”

If you’ve been daydreaming about a road trip in a RV this summer, you’re not alone. I recently tackled the subject in an article for Forbes article called Will 2020 Be The Year of RV Travel? The conclusion, I believe, is a resounding “yes.”

RV’s offer a self-contained home that make them ideal for social distancing. By booking a campground in advance, or even heading off the grid in parts of the American West, you can plan a driving itinerary that will sate some of the wanderlust you’ve probably felt in lockdown.

Even if the closest you’ve come to a motorhome or trailer is passing one on the highway, these mobile homes away from home have gripped the popular imagination. There’s an array of vehicles, from small towable trailers to large motorhomes the size of a bus. Some come with the bare necessities for a backwoods’ experience while others have an array of hook-ups, generators, and even solar panels.

They also come with a hefty price tag, ranging from $20,000 for a small towable trailer to $200,000 and up for a new motorhome. They also, depreciate just as a new car does the moment it’s taken off a dealer’s lot. Of course, there’s also the matter of having a place to park or store it when it isn’t being driven. So if you’re someone who’s convinced that this is the summer of the RV but doesn’t want to commit to a purchase, you have two options. You can rent, through the website GoRVing.com.

Or you can tap into the sharing economy and check out RVShare for a rental. The company, which estimates that most RV’s sit unused for 90% of the year, connects you to owners in your area or at your destination. They have literally thousands of privately owned RV’s that are placed in their rental pool, including Class A Motorhomes, Class C Motorhomes, Fifth Wheels and Travel Trailers. These are very general categories, encompassing as they do the vehicles from many different manufacturers, from Winnebago to Thor to Forest River. Search results can be filtered by price, reviews, and desirable features like a rear back up camera. There’s also an option to have the RV delivered to you.

The cost varies widely, depending upon where you’re located. In the greater New York area, you might pay $300 a night to drive a 2017 35-foot long Class A Thor Motor Coach Miramar 34.3, which can sleep nine and looks like one of those buses that rock stars use when they’re on tour. At the other end of the spectrum, there’s a 2015 Jayco Jay Flight SLX 165 RB, a fairly utilitarian 18-foot trailer that sleeps three people for $125 per night.

Of course, cleanliness has taken on greater import in the past six months. RVshare has provided CDC cleaning guidelines to owners and recently partnered with TaskRabbit, which helps match RV owners with local professional cleaners to effectively clean their RVs pre- and post-rental.

Naturally, there are extras. Standard RVshare rental insurance runs $24 a day, a $100 cleaning fee and in some cases, a charge of 35 cents per mile over the first free 100 miles. Gas is also a factor, especially with large motorhomes that may average between just six to eight miles per gallon. In the end, RVshare offers one more way to hit the open road during this challenging summer.","RVshareIf you’ve been daydreaming about a road trip in a RV this summer, you’re not alone.

The Ann Arbor Democratic Party moderated the forum between incumbent Jack Eaton and challengers Jen Eyer and Mozhgan Savabieasfahani, who are seeking the Ann Arbor City Council 4th Ward seat in the Aug. 4 primary election. Rebuttals were not allowed.

The top issue in the 4th ward is infrastructure, Eyer, a public relations specialist and former Ann Arbor News/MLive journalist, said, adding she’s heard many residents who worry about road quality and pedestrian safety. Eyer said she wants to prioritize road projects and consider more bonding to get the projects done.

“We know we can’t count on Lansing to give us the funding that we need to fix our roads and so we really need to work to identify every local dollar that we can to put toward that effort,” Eyer said.

Eyer said she also wants to work with DTE Energy and the Public Services Commission to address higher frequencies of power outages in the ward and accelerate plans for retention basins to lower chances of flooding.

Ward 4 Ann Arbor council candidates discuss coronavirus outbreak, sustainability in forum

Eaton said he doesn’t think there is one biggest issue in the ward. He said affordable housing, climate change and police reform are top issues that residents identify in Ann Arbor, and it’s important for a city councilor to listen to all concerns when making policy.

Savabieasfahani said a main problem in Ann Arbor is the lack of a $15/hour minimum wage in the city, which could help people better afford to stay in the city.

“$15 minimum wage is not a luxury, it a necessity,” she said.

The candidates were also asked what City Council should do to handle the impending budget shortfall and financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Eaton said his experience on City Council separates him from his opponents. Eaton was first elected in 2013 and said his seven budget cycles have prepared him for facing cuts.

“We are not done making cuts to our budget and we need to have someone who is fully experienced in the budget process,” Eaton said.

Savabieasfahani, an environmentalist, said cuts will damage ultimately lower income residents. She said a millage proposal could raise the funds needed to keep up and improve social services during the pandemic and an imminent recession.

Eyer, who spent two decades as a journalist before joining political public relations firms, was appointed to the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners for about six months. She said she would first focus on funding for programs that serve vulnerable populations, then prioritize based on “triage” of what can be delayed and what is less important.

“What we decide to fund as a community is a direct reflection of our values of that community, or it should be,” she said.

Eyer said she was part of budget discussions at The Ann Arbor News to determine how to continue community coverage with less funding when budgets began shrinking in the newsroom.

Ann Arbor Ward 3 council candidates discuss gentrification, racial justice and political factions in forum

Savabieasfahani and Eyer both avoided commenting on the philosophical differences between factions on the City Council. But Eaton said he didn’t believe there were two factions, rather a block of four members who vote together while the other seven are more independent in their voting.

The candidates were asked what local government should do to address racial justice as residents across the United States have protested police brutality and systemic racism during the past two weeks. Eaton pointed out that there is only one non-white member of the City Council and wondered how the body could better represent the city. He said his interest in police reform comes from a place of racial justice.

Savabieasfahani, meanwhile, said she thinks Ann Arbor should expand its partnership with Neutral Zone, a teen-focused nonprofit, to provide more opportunities for minority youth.

Eyer said she wants to use one of the city’s missions, diversity, to promote better access to housing, equitable transit, green and clean neighborhoods and equity in the justice system. She said she recently marched in several Black Lives Matter marches because she was upset by racial inequity.

“My heart goes out to the parents of black children, who suffer extra worry when their kids leave the home,” she said. “I know and I recognize my privilege in not having that anxiety and I am with those parents in the fight to create a better world for your children.”

Candidates also were asked how to address growth in Ann Arbor. Savabieasfahani called for public housing, saying it was the only way to ensure housing equality in the city. She said the past decades have shown that private developers can’t make affordable housing in the city.

“I think growth is a necessity,” she said. “But my question is who does the investment in the growth and who harvests the benefits of that growth?”

Eyer said she thinks City Council should be more proactive with affordable housing by revising the land use plan. She also called for using a portion of new developments’ taxes to go to the city’s affordable housing fund.

Eaton said he thinks a potential pause in development is coming as a financial impact of the pandemic. He wants to take that time to reevaluate the city’s strategy. He opposed ideas to reduce or eliminate single-family zoning because it could cause gentrification in low and middle-income neighborhoods.

Eaton wants to focus on development in areas of town that are likely to go through transformation and demolition in the business and retail sectors.

City Council candidate forums continue with a 5th Ward forum featuring Erica Briggs, Dan Michniewicz and David Silkworth scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday, June 17.

Under normal circumstances, heading out of town in an RV for a few nights isn't a ""dream"" vacation for many of us. Hitting the road in a camper is the sort of activity reserved for retirees and B-list touring bands, right? Of course, nothing is normal these days, and with a litany of travel restrictions at play and skittishness around social distancing, lots of people are considering renting an RV in an effort to pull off something even vaguely resembling a summer vacation. If you're one of them, we've got great news. There's a site out there that makes it incredibly easy to rent campers, trailers, and RVs directly from owners in your area. And the even better news? It's not that expensive.

The idea that this will be the summer of the RV isn't mere speculation. In fact, Bloomberg reports that motor home sales have skyrocketed in recent weeks, as people out of both fear and frustration are buying up ""Covid Campers."" That said, you definitely don't need to buy an RV to enjoy a nice getaway in a motorhome. That's where RVShare comes in.

Much like Airbnb, RVshare helps you easily search and book someone else's property. The only difference, of course, is these properties are portable: campers, trailers, and motorhomes. You simply plug in your location, when you'd like to book one, and the number of guests you'll be traveling with (1-6+), and it'll show you listings for any and all RVs available nearby. From there, you can further filter results based on any number of criteria, from price, to amenities, RV/trailer type, and whether the owner offers delivery (an especially helpful feature if you don't have a vehicle). Then, it's up to you to coordinate with the owner to confirm your reservation, and voila, you're in business. Some rentals are even available for ""Instant Booking"" (like Airbnb), so you don't even have to await owner approval.

Prices are generally very reasonable, and based on our findings, tend to hover in the $150-250 per night range (some newer and more luxurious options will run you upwards of $500). Most also come with a 100 mileage allotment per ""night"" booked (with mileage overages typically on par with a rental car).

The availability of RVs obviously depends heavily on the area you're searching in, but there are literally hundreds to choose from in and around almost every major U.S. city (including lots and lots of Airstreams).

Head to RVshare and book yours before the summer of the RV really takes off.","Under normal circumstances, heading out of town in an RV for a few nights isn't a ""dream"" vacation for many of us.

In a video interaction with journalists from BusinessLine, the Qualcomm India VP said that India could soon have 5G smartphones in the price range of ₹15,000-20,000. “If I go by the trends of the pastm I can say India will have a ₹15 (thousand) or a ₹20,000 phone that would probably be a 5G going forward,” Vagadia said.

Expansion to lower tiers

He said that affordability in terms of 5G can be enabled much faster as compared to 4G.

Qualcomm is already been looking to drive affordability in its 5G segment. After bringing 5G to its 800, 700 and 600 series, the chipmaker is looking to expand 5G support to its lower tiers.

“We have already announced a 600 series phone. The OEM I was talking to, we're having a conversation of the launch of the device. If everything goes right, I might see a launch of a (phone) with 600 series which could be somewhere between ₹10,000 and ₹20,000 which could be a 5G phone by the end of the year itself from one or two brands,” Vagadia said.

“So we are on that track. Likewise, four series will follow. We have it on the roadmap for sure. But we have yet to talk to the OEMs in terms of what are their plans to bring it,” he further said.

“If you're investing in a phone, you always want to ensure that you're covered up for the future. And I think 5G will come gradually but it'll come faster than what we have already realized,” he added.

Setbacks due to Covid-19

Qualcomm’s strategy to expand the adoption of 5G phones could face setbacks owing to the Covid-19 pandemic which has negatively impacted the mobile industry.

On being asked whether the pandemic will lead to a further dip in sales and will hinder Qualcomm’s 5G push, Vagadia was rather optimistic about the industry coping with the pandemic’s impact.

The smartphone sales in India may see a dip for a certain amount of time. However, companies can leverage online platforms to push sales the Qualcomm India executive said.

“Smartphone numbers are going down. However, here the structure is a little bit different. I think we will not see the impact as bad as it was if we would have had the online-offline ratio, like the rest of the world, because of online being more proactive and prominent here,” Vagadia said.

“I think the OEMs are designing and being ready as manufacturing plants are also trying to ramp up supply is now becoming a little bit different, too, because factories have just started. They’re not to the optimized level, they will go back there in the next few weeks. So with all those parameters and uncertainty today, I may still say that it will be subdued from another month or two,” he further said.

The companies will cover up once the relaxation comes in, Vagadia said. “The moment you start seeing the relaxation coming in I think we shouldn't be going back to our original self. So we see a subdued number for sure of the world smartphone sold, right could be down by probably a few percentage points, it would be somewhere around less than 10 per cent. But there is a good chance we could cover-up,” he added.

Despite a setback from the pandemic, the tech giant is sticking to its original target for 5G phones. We still maintain and we still believe strongly that if we're given a projection that there will be approximately 200 billion of 5G phones in 2020 in the world, we will stick to that,” said Vagadia.","India could have affordable 5G smartphones by the end of the year, said Rajen Vagadia, VP and President, Qualcomm India & SAARC.

We never thought we’d be adding face coverings and face masks to our online shopping baskets along with our summer dresses or new running shoes, yet here we are.

Wearing a face covering in shops and enclosed public spaces is now mandatory in England. This includes supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, banks and takeaways.

Under the new enforcement, those who do not comply can now be denied entry, removed from shops, or could face a fine of up to £100.

Children under the age of 11 and those with disabilities or certain health conditions will be exempt from the rule.

This news follows government advice, released last month, that suggested face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces - including public transport and when visiting some shops.

While you could choose to make your own face covering from home using old fabric, or a T-shirt, many of us will be looking to stock up on ready-made masks online from independent sellers or high street stores.

KLF offers affordable healthcare options specifically aimed at people without medical aid, as well as those who have medical aid but often find their benefits depleted.

Providing accessible quality healthcare, KLF offers three different options. These include options for private patients, a family top-up option as well as an individual top-up option.

The options give members access to private general practitioner consultations, acute medication, selective blood tests and funeral benefits underwritten by Sanlam.

Dr Christo Burger, managing partner of the Khomas Medical Group, said: ""I am confident and extremely excited that this new product, the KLF, will change the whole medical industry, offering the people of Namibia a chance to have access to private healthcare. The fund will provide accessible quality healthcare in private health facilities, which were previously difficult to access, due to high costs of healthcare in our country. This is one of the reasons why the KLF will bring relief to many in the country who were previously excluded from accessing private health facilities and will also bring aid in reducing the huge burden on the public health sector facilities.""

With health facilities in seven different locations in Windhoek and health facilities in Mondesa, Swakopmund, Burger added: ""The Khomas Loyalty Fund is ready to begin serving the Namibian nation.""

Several Ugandan and British companies from the renewable energy sector took part in the discussions which focused on the challenges of electrification through clean, affordable and sustainable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, etc….

Challenges related to the popularisation of renewable energies

The Ugandan and British companies that participated in the online event believe that renewable energy could make a difference in many countries around the world and more specifically in developing countries as they have enormous potential. These sources of electricity are cheaper and competitive with fossil fuels. However, the deployment of renewable energy is hampered by three challenges according to the World Bank. These are “technical constraints on grid integration, risks related to weak procurement capacity, and the planning of national power companies. The financial institution says countries could increase their renewable energy production at lower cost and in a sustainable manner by developing “an appropriate enabling environment, in particular improving the financial viability of national utilities and their planning capacities, as well as the key public investments needed to integrate renewable energy production. The alternative would be the balanced and equitable sharing of risks between public and private stakeholders through transparent and competitive procurement systems”.

In addition to exploring ways and opportunities, the virtual trade mission introduced 12 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the renewable energy sector to investment opportunities in Uganda. The virtual exchange also aimed to engage with British organisations that are candidates for the Energy Catalyst Round 8 (ECRP) programme on Uganda’s electricity access challenges.

The competition aims to support innovative and sustainable electricity access technologies and business models to accelerate the transition to clean energy in developing and emerging economies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme is currently funded by the UK Government’s Global ChallengesResearch Fund (GCRF) and Department for International Development (DfID) under its Transforming Energy Access programme.

The collaboration, led by Mobile Power in partnership with Professor Dan Gladwin from the University’s Energy Institute and Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, has already developed pay-per-charge smart battery packs to address the lack of grid electricity in the country.

Energy storage

Rural electrification

The pay-as-you-go smart battery rental system, developed by Mobile Power, supplies affordable, clean energy to poor households and enterprises in off-grid communities.

The batteries are charged at solar charging stations before being delivered to customers, thereby removing the need for dangerous traditional petrol generators and reducing energy costs by up to 75%.

A second project will now work with Professor Gladwin and other battery storage experts from the University to develop significantly larger Lithium-ion battery packs that can store energy as part of a mini-grid and will be ‘hot-swappable’ – meaning they can be rented out for household, transport and commercial use, such as to run fridges for medicines in hospitals, then returned back to the micro-grid to be recharged.

In sub-Saharan Africa, population growth outstrips electrification, even while people increasingly rely on electrical equipment for communication and commerce. This lack of energy stifles economic growth and limits living standards and opportunities.

A study by Mobile Power in 2016/17 showed that 20% of household income in Sierra Leone is spent on lighting and mobile phone charging. Most of these lighting costs are spent on disposable batteries, which creates an environmental issue, and mobile phones are charged at ‘telecentres’ in towns, powered by polluting and dangerous petrol generators.

Professor Gladwin said: “These new battery packs can be swapped in or out of the micro-grid without shutting down the power system and are designed to maximise the life of the battery cells under different applications.

“They can one day be providing power to a whole village and the next day be swapped out to drive the motor of an electric KeKes (auto-rickshaw). For households where the cost of connection to the mini-grid is prohibitively high, these packs are easily carried to the home and are capable of powering multiple devices for long durations.”

The partnership between Mobile Power and the University will enable research into pack design and its docking/charging system to optimise charging speeds, cycle life of the battery packs and the management of the hot-swappable system.

Jono West, Founder and Chair at Mobile Power and Project Lead, said: “We are grateful for the partnership with Professor Dan Gladwin, particularly in his support and advice to date. We look forward to working closely together on this project.”

Two other project partners will be conducting field trials at two sites in Sierra Leone: Winch Energy, a global, off-grid energy developer and technology integrator, and Pink Power, a local non-governmental organisation.

At Winch Energy’s mini-grid in Sierra Leone, women will act as energy entrepreneurs, renting out the batteries for household and micro-enterprise use. At Pink Power’s site in Freetown, a trial will take place to power electric tuk-tuk’s with the battery packs. This will be part of Pink Power’s wider project on training vulnerable women to drive the tuk-tuks as a form of employment.

West added: “Two of the greatest challenges facing the world in meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for Agenda 2030 are universal energy access and gender equality and women’s empowerment.

“This Innovate UK Energy Catalyst project looks to find a way to allow these goals to mutually support one another, by empowering women entrepreneurs in the delivery of energy services in hard to reach communities through Mobile Power’s battery technology.”

That's enough power for 1 million homes. Asbury Park Press

In an effort to advocate for policies that favor the state’s investment in alternative energy sources, we’ve seen volumes of misinformation interjected into the public discussion that simply is designed to mislead the consumer and those who influence public policy. The fact of the matter is that New Jersey’s mad dash toward the new Energy Master plan falls hard on taxpayers to fund the infrastructure and will result in higher energy costs for those least able to afford it.

Renewable energy sources should be an important part of the mix. Local and national polls underscore the public support for such initiatives. However, that same research clearly illustrates consumer preference for choice, reliability and affordability through access to other mainstays of our energy infrastructure such as clean natural gas.

But hard line advocates who place their own public policy goals above consumer interests — even during the disastrous economic losses experienced during the pandemic — actively hide the opulent costs of their proposals. The tone-deaf lobbying of these organizations leans toward an astonishing lack of empathy and understanding of the financial impact on economically disadvantaged communities in both urban and rural areas of this state. Simply put, these advocacy interests who blindly push for single source energy structures betray their economic narcissism. Since they can afford higher energy costs, everyone should.

Make it even easier to read the latest opinions from APP.com by downloading our mobile app today.

Thanks largely to natural gas, which provides more than 40 percent of New Jersey’s energy generation, the state lowered emissions by 27 percent from 2005 to 2015. Yet New Jerseyans still pay the 11th-highest energy bills in the country, a ranking that is almost certain to worsen even further if the Energy Master Plan and its expensive mandates are enacted.

For example, just look at proposals to electrify the entire transportation sector. The Rocky Mountain Institute itself recently admitted that the actual costs of electric vehicle infrastructure are poorly understood and difficult to calculate. The calculations that the organization was able to perform suggest that Level 2 charging infrastructure would cost as much as $5,000 per charger. That is an immense sum, and one that, when expanded to meet the Energy Master Plan’s electrification goals, would cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. And who pays for that cost — New Jersey taxpayers, of course?

The costs don’t end there.

Retrofitting homes to provide electric heating and cooling systems in New Jersey — where the vast majority of residents rely on natural gas — would cost homeowners potentially tens of thousands of dollars. In Massachusetts, a recent study suggested that the cost of home heating electrification could be more than $20,000 for an average-sized home. According to the Energy Master plan itself, electric heating costs are almost twice as much annually as natural gas. Those out-of-pocket costs are immense, but they don’t begin to account for the full picture in higher rates and higher taxes that would be needed to fund the Energy Master Plan’s stated goals.

Offshore wind: New port to bring 1,500 jobs to NJ

As someone who’s worked in the utility industry for decades, I know how complex our energy systems are. While renewables are an important part of the solution and a laudable long-term goal, they require heavy subsidies and cannot by themselves meet our needs, especially at peak levels of demand. New Jersey must stop actively blocking projects that would expand access to natural gas, increase reliability and lower costs, so that while we move toward our renewable energy goals, we ensure adequate capacity that is actually affordable.

We need to come together to support a balanced mix of energy sources that prioritizes affordability, reliability, and clean energy alike. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated our economy and burdened our residents with economic uncertainty like never before. All of our state’s communities can benefit from lower energy costs. We need to do everything we can to avoid the higher taxes, higher rates and hidden costs baked into the state’s Energy Master Plan.

We have tools at our disposal to provide inexpensive and stable energy for our state. Now is the time to do so.

The West Africa Regional Energy Trade Development Policy Financing Program (West Africa Energy DPF) seeks to remove barriers to electricity trade, which will lower electricity costs for consumers, support the competitiveness of firms and improve resilience and reliability of supply. Currently, only 50 percent of the population in West Africa have access to electricity, and those who do, pay among the highest prices in the world – more than double those of consumers in East Africa. In addition, due to operational deficiencies, electricity services are unreliable, with an average of 44 hours of outages per month.

Over the past decade, member countries of the Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS) have been working — through the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) — towards a fully integrated power market. Within a few years, they will have completed the primary interconnectors that will link them together. The West Africa Energy DPF supports a policy reform program being implemented by Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, to facilitate trade in cleaner low cost electricity generated from gas, hydropower and renewable energy across borders. This will replace the more expensive electricity generated from inefficient small-scale oil-fired and diesel generation and improve the reliability of electricity services.

“West Africa has huge potential for clean and green energy generation, which countries can unlock and pool together to bring lower cost electricity to communities and help create jobs,” says Ousmane Diagana, the World Bank Vice-President for Western and Central Africa. “The West Africa Power Pool has done the fundamental work of interconnecting national grids, and it is now time to realize the full strength of the regional power market. Coordinated policies paired with effective institutions and regulatory frameworks will help improve trust in the electricity trade and usher in a new era of affordable and reliable energy in West Africa.”

The new operation supports a regional energy reform program set out in three pillars. The first aims to increase confidence in the enforcement of commercial arrangements by supporting payments and enforcement mechanisms relating to energy trade. The second supports the implementation of least cost investment decisions that consider regional options and that promote competition. The third supports transparency, by addressing creditworthiness of national power utilities and keeping the market informed on key investment decisions that impact demand and supply.

“This is a landmark program for achieving our goal of having a regional energy market and I want to thank the World Bank support,” says Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, President of the ECOWAS Commission. “The West Africa Power Pool will continue to make strides and with this support, it can help member countries work together on the key coordinated policy reforms needed to deliver regional electricity trade – and therefore access more affordable and reliable electricity. By better using energy resources in the region, we expect the resulting efficient and resilient power systems to make our economies much more productive and inclusive. ECOWAS will continue to be a strong partner in realizing this goal.”

The West Africa Regional Energy Trade Development Policy Financing Program is the first World Bank operation to use the IDA Regional Window for a DPF program. It allows the World Bank to support reforms in order to reach a common objective across several countries in a coordinated manner. It represents a watershed on the regional integration agenda in West Africa by supporting the operationalization of the ECOWAS Directive on the Securitization of Cross-Border Power Trade, which was adopted in December 2018 and aimed at creating a regional power market. Across the ECOWAS region, the economic benefits of the regional power market are evaluated at $665 million per year with a reduction of one third in the average cost of electricity generation in the region.

* The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world’s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people’s lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 76 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.6 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $21 billion over the last three years, with about 61 percent going to Africa.","The West Africa Regional Energy Trade Development Policy Financing Program (West Africa Energy DPF) seeks to remove barriers to electricity trade, which will lower electricity costs for consumers, support the competitiveness of firms and improve resilience and reliability of supply.

173,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/affordable-refrigeration-in-developing-countries/,"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Providing Affordable Refrigeration in Developing Countries,"DENVER, Colorado — Engineers Without Borders (EWB) USA announced that seven recipients received grants as a result of its “Chill Challenge,” an initiative to create affordable refrigeration technologies and community ice-makers for off-grid communities in developing nations. These developments will lead to less food waste and improved nutrition for the poor and will also be crucial in delivering vaccines and other healthcare services to disconnected communities. These innovative developers created unique ways to access affordable refrigeration in developing countries.

Lack of Access to Affordable Refrigeration in Developing Countries

There are two billion people globally who do not have access to reliable, affordable refrigeration in developing countries. The Borgen Project recently interviewed Larry Bentley and F. Andrew Dowdy, the organizers of the Chill Challenge, to understand more about the motivation behind devising this challenge. Bentley, a retired engineer who helped to design and implement power systems for rural communities in 20 developing countries, spoke about his experience aiding rural bush clinics and regional hospitals in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where there was a severe lack of access to grid connection and working generators. This is a problem, Bentley stressed, because, without access to electricity, a large percentage of these clinics and hospitals cannot access necessities such as a sufficient water supply or oxygen concentrators. These concentrators absorb nitrogen and provide supplemental oxygen to help respiratory patients breathe.

Additionally, Dowdy, a retired engineer and diplomat who focused on energy policy issues that would bring electricity to developing countries, stated how a refrigerator is a “power hog” that requires a 24-hour operation. While this may not be a significant issue for places that have cheap, grid-based power, Dowdy says the cost of electricity for off-grid communities in the developing world is “5-10 times higher.” Consequently, even though a small refrigerator may cost $20-$25 per month, Dowdy states, this may add up to “10%” of a poor household’s total income. Low-income, off-grid communities are therefore less likely to purchase a refrigerator and have access to electricity.

“Chill Challenge”: Developing Low-Cost Refrigeration Technologies

Bentley and Dowdy devised the Chill Challenge to address the lack of access that off-grid communities have to electricity in developing countries. The evolution criteria were “centered on affordability and suitability” for use in developing countries, according to Bentley, with an added emphasis on innovation. The main question was: how could these technological solutions drive down costs such that impoverished people in remote, off-grid communities could reasonably afford these products?

The solutions concentrated around what the consumers at the “bottom of the pyramid” are more likely to demand, Dowdy states. This includes plans for larger refrigerators, which may be suitable for a shop, or ice-makers, which could provide refrigeration for many households or commercial purposes rather than individual household refrigerators. Below is a description of three out of the seven grant winners who received funding to develop their proposed technologies that provide affordable refrigeration in developing countries.

New Leaf Dynamic Technologies, New Delhi, India: Ice-Maker Powered by Farm Waste

This company will use its “GreenCHILL” adsorption technology to develop an ice-maker driven by farm waste, including wood, hay, biomass pellets, straw and cow dung. The ice-maker will be able to cool 15 metric tons of perishable goods, or 1,500 liters of milk, without using electric power or a generator at an affordable production cost of $0.02 per kilogram (KG). This price, Akash Agarwal, a cofounder, states in an interview with The Borgen Project, is 10 times cheaper than the “conventional system.” Furthermore, Agarwal affirms, the ice-maker is a “green solution” that enables farmers to be “completely independent” and have access to an energy source that is “available throughout the year.”

Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, South Kensington, UK: Affordable Decentralized Off-Grid Ice-Making

The CEP Laboratory and Solar Polar will design a solar-driven diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) ice-maker that uses sunlight as a form of “radiative heat,” traps it into a fluid stream in “solar thermal collectors” and thereafter produces ice. In an interview with The Borgen Project, Christos Markides, a Chemical Engineering Professor who leads the CEP Laboratory, states that it was critical to design a system that may not have access to electricity or easy access to water to resemble the situation in many arid and remote regions. Therefore, Prof. Markides says, the ice-maker will not use a compressor or need electricity to operate and will instead use the ammonia, water and hydrogen to create pressure and temperature differences that create ice.

Xergy, Inc., Harrington, Delaware: Off-the-Grid Refrigerator Utilizing Solid-State Refrigerants

Xergy plans to build a refrigerator that is driven by thermal energy and uses “metal hydrides” to “metallurgically bond” with hydrogen gas to produce cooling. In an interview with The Borgen Project, Jacob Xerby, the VP of Operations, stated that this heat transfer through metal is “hundreds of times better” than heat transfer through a gas, leading to more efficient and cost-effective cooling. Furthermore, Xerby contends that solar thermal refrigeration is much more “economically viable” than nuclear, gas, fossil fuel, wind energies or photovoltaic (PV) energies.

The rest of the grant winners included the Ray W. Herrick Laboratories at Purdue University, which won two grants for its “Cold Storage Battery for Domestic Refrigeration” and its “Heating and Cooling for Agricultural Applications,” Solar Cooling Engineering’s “Solar Ice-Maker Using Key Components and Engineering,” and Arup’s “Passive Cooling Box.”

How Do Refrigeration Technologies Impact Off-Grid Communities?

When off-grid communities gain access to refrigeration technologies, this means that there will be less food waste, safer storage for “high-quality” vaccines, fewer market trips to buy perishable foods and more opportunities for farmers to boost their incomes. This increased availability to the “cold chain” process, which extends the life of dairy products, fish, fruit and vegetables, can lead to amplified brain development and improve children’s education. This is because, Bentley asserts, students who “eat better, do better” in school. Access to refrigeration technologies can also reduce the burden on women and advance gender equality, Dowdy states, by reducing the number of trips that they take to the market to acquire perishable foods.

EWB’s Chill Challenge awarded seven grants to colleges and companies that commit themselves to expand the reach of affordable refrigeration in developing countries to low-income, off-grid communities in hopes of reducing food waste, increasing nutrition and fostering gender equality.

The portable desalination device - currently available from as little $60 - will now go into full production and the first units are set to ship in February 2021.

Portable, affordable handheld desalination device is perfect for emergency water use, boaters, hikers, survivalists, adventurers

To accommodate demand, the company has extended its Indiegogo campaign until July 29 - meaning there's still a chance for sailors, campers, hikers, survivalists, preppers and travelers to back the project at the reduced campaign price. An extra water filter worth around $10 is included with each purchase.

There is also still opportunity to make a significant dent in the global water crisis. Quench Sea is donating one device to humanitarian projects such as Project Maji for every device bought during its crowdfunding campaign. It hopes to donate over 100 million units by 2027.

Quench Sea is capable of making up to three litres of drinkable water per hour. The handle-powered unit fits into a small bag; simply pump it for as long as is needed to provide the volume of clean water desired. You can watch how it works here and an independent verification video is here.

""As well as being an ideal survival tool for adventurers, Quench Sea can be delivered at scale in a humanitarian crisis,"" said Lee King, founder and CEO of Hydro Wind Energy. ""Every unit sold will help to get one of these devices into the hands of charities focused on water scarcity and distributed to where they're needed most.""

Two-thirds of the world's population live in areas plagued by water scarcity and more than two billion people live without access to clean water. Water scarcity is also a growing problem for many developed nations. Quench Sea can be stored as an emergency device for homeowners living in coastal regions, where natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and droughts can have a short term impact on access to clean water.

In South Africa, LPG supplier Afrox has signed a supply agreement with PayGas to offer easier, flexible access to low-income households who cannot always afford a full gas cylinder.

Launched in 2018, PayGas uses proprietary technology that fractions gas purchases into smaller quantities, making the purchase process more flexible and affordable.

Heightened interested in LNG stimulates Africa’s gas economy

The technology is powered by a pay-as-you-go Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) software payment platform combined with a cashless refilling station and mobile app, connected to a barcode on the customers’ cylinders.

The PayGas user buys a prepaid voucher via their cell phone at any spaza shop or the closest Pay as you Gas station. They then use the PayGas app to fill their Afrox Safety Gas cylinder, totally or partially, for as little as R10 (approximately $1), at a Pay as you Gas station.

Gerhard van Wyk, the business manager LPgas at Afrox, says the gas company had identified a wide scope for growth in the informal and domestic LPG market in South Africa, and that PayGas’ vision, mission and values align with Afrox’s goal to offer sustainable energy solutions that foster greater choice and responsible energy consumption.

Though many households in South Africa have access to electricity, wood and paraffin are still extensively used for cooking and heating because of power shortages and the increasing cost of electricity.

Wood and paraffin can be bought in smaller quantities but traditional LPG (though a safer and more sustainable fuel option) means purchasing a full cylinder at a time, problematic for households with irregular incomes.

However, a Pay as you Gas system allows the customer to purchase a small amount of gas at a time, encouraging low-income households to switch to clean, affordable energy.

Purchasing pay as you go gas in the neighbourhood

In April 2019, PayGas rolled out a pilot Pay as you Gas station in Delft, Cape Town servicing more than 4,000 low-income residents in the township and there are plans to expand well beyond the Mother City (Cape Town’s informal name).

“With Afrox’s LPG supply, support and expertise, we can now execute an ambitious plan to roll out several Pay as you Gas stations catering to close to 200,000 customers across major townships in South Africa in the next 36 months,” said Philippe Hoeblich, Founder and CEO at PayGas.

“I founded PayGas in response to a gaping need for flexible affordable cooking energy for lower-income households in urban areas in South Africa and we can’t wait to execute on our ambitious plans to cater to more households in more cities in the country.”

Together with Afrox and through a micro-franchising with Pick ‘n Pay Market Stores owners, PayGas plans to roll out five new Pay as you Gas stations within the next six weeks, including Philippi Village, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Langa and Kayamandi.

PayGas also plans to roll out three additional stations in Johannesburg plus two in Durban during 2021.

Afrox will install LPG dumpy tank storage vessels at each Pay as you Gas station, shaped in a unique ready-to-use container developed by PayGas, and supply each station with approximately 2,500 cylinders to ensure sufficient cylinder stock.

Their lighter and more portable 5kg Safety Gas cylinders were specifically chosen for this market where residents often have to carry cylinders from gas depots to their homes.","Customers who cannot afford to refill an entire gas cylinder will now have the option to buy nominal amounts of LPG at a Pay as You Gas station.

This will obviously mean more affordable mobility solutions tailored to meet people’s needs that consider the “right sizing” approach making sure the solutions are the best fit for their intended purpose.

In many communities, most people’s daily commutes often average just under 10 kilometers. In certain areas, people’s needs could be met with some form of transportation that is capable of a little over 20 kilometers (km) of range. In many large informal or high density low income neighborhoods in a lot of African countries, commuters and traders often face challenges getting about connecting to the main public transport routes that serve their areas.

These main roads that are served by the public transport service operators such as the minibus taxis — or matatus, as they are called in Kenya — are often a bit far from where the people actually stay, or the people simply can’t afford the fare and have to walk several kilometers to get to where they need to go. A lot of startups are also scaling up their services in these areas, enabling farmers and traders to send their goods to the market in an efficient way, such as Twiga Foods.

In such an environment, affordable electric micro-mobility solutions can make a huge difference. That is what Linccell Technology Kenya wants to do in Kenya. It wants to be the “inclusive” eMobility company building robust electric wheelchairs, bicycles, and scooters that are suitable for local conditions and built to handle the local roads, which are not always as good as the main roads.

Linccell wants to do all this and still ensure it will be able to offer its products at an affordable price. To achieve this, the company’s mobility products are built from recycled and upcycled materials. Up to 90% of the materials used are sourced locally, with only the electric motors imported from China.

This is another great example of how electromobility can boost the circular economy. Linccell assembles its battery packs using the standard 18650 cells recovered from old laptops, which allows them to lower the costs of their products significantly to levels that are more affordable for their target market.

Here is a video interview of Linccell Founder Lincoln Wamae talking about the company’s products. Other players in the East African Region, such as Bodawerk, are also using cells from old laptops to make battery packs for larger motorcycles. To make some of its wheelchairs, Linccell repurposes old office chairs, and given that millions of tonnes of office furniture end up in landfills, there won’t be a shortage of raw materials.

The Kenya State of the Cities report “shows that majority of these people miss out on opportunities, due to the high cost of transportation, and poor roads.” 42% of commuters in Nairobi walk to where they need to go as they can’t afford the cost of matatus. Affordable electric micro-mobility solutions could really improve their quality of life. 39% of CO2 emissions in Kenya are from the transport sector.

Kenya has really excelled in increasing the share of renewable electricity in its electricity generation mix. A whopping 93% of electricity generation in Kenya is from renewable energy sources. This mix includes significant contributions from wind farms, geothermal power plants, hydropower, and some utility-scale solar. In meeting its renewable energy generation targets, Kenya has found itself in an interesting position where there is excess capacity at times, especially at night when demand drops significantly.

There won’t be a shortage of electricity to charge these micro-mobility solutions, and these solutions will enable more people to access mobility solutions without adding to the many ICE options that contribute to the current levels of CO2 emissions. These affordable mobility solutions could also be financed via the existing pay-as-you-go platforms, lowering the barriers to adoption. The PAYGO model has been widely adopted in the off-grid solar space in East Africa.

It’s good to see more and more local firms producing electric mobility products across Africa. This will create much-needed job opportunities and also ensure that the products being rolled out meet the specific needs of the intended beneficiaries. Bodawerk and Opibus in Uganda and Kenya respectively are converting old motorcycles to electric. In Namibia, SunCycles is manufacturing electric bicycles, and Mobility for Africa is assembling electric 3-wheelers in Zimbabwe for its rural projects.

Affordable housing was ranked No. 5 on The Counselors of Real Estate’s Top Ten Issues Affecting Real Estate.

In this era of political divisiveness, there are two things that most can agree on: 1. There is a tremendous need for affordable housing throughout America. 2. There is a strong “Not in My Backyard” or NIMBY agenda.

Affordable need

The tremendous need for affordable housing was well-documented in a report published on March 13, 2018, by the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. The report found there was a shortage of 7.2 million affordable rental homes for extremely low income renter households—those with incomes at or below the poverty level or 30 percent of their area median income. The study finds there are just 35 affordable and available units for every 100 ELI renter households nationwide, and that 71 percent of ELI renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing.

After paying their rent, these households have insufficient resources left for other necessities like food, medicine, transportation or childcare. They are often one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness. What’s noteworthy is that the shortage of ELI housing does not account for the 568,000 people who are experiencing homelessness, as the report included only households with an address. As Lauren Sandler points out in her recent book “This Is All I Got,” most people in poverty are women, specifically women of color, and one in 30 children in America is homeless, which amounts to over 2.5 million kids.

According to an Urban Wire report published on May 27, “Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the affordability crisis driven by the lack of housing supply was one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. housing market.” The report finds that prices for homes in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution—low-price homes—increased 126 percent between January 2000 and December 2019. This is a substantially larger increase than the 87 percent increase for homes in the top 20th percentile of the distribution—high-price homes.

The faster rise in low-price home costs hits low-income homeowners and renters the hardest, specifically those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution. As low-price home prices rise, would-be homebuyers with low incomes have trouble finding affordable homes, so they remain in the rental market, drive up rents, and increase the demand for and price of rental properties. As a result, the cost for both owning and renting has gone up substantially for low-income households, while their income growth has not kept pace with that of high-income households—those in the top quartile of the income distribution.

A closer look at 285 metropolitan statistical areas suggests that rapid employment growth, combined with increased supply constraints from zoning and other regulations, contributed to this disproportionate price growth for low-price homes. If left unaddressed, these same supply constraints will hamper the ability of low-income households to prosper, as we emerge from the crisis, and will exacerbate income inequality.

Not in my backyard

The NIMBY syndrome, a form of institutionalized racism that has operated below the surface of public opinion, surfaced in New Jersey in 1972. In a town called Mt. Laurel, the zoning ordinance did not permit townhomes or multifamily housing, and the minimum lot size for single-family homes was set at 1 to 5 acres. The town’s zoning code essentially excluded the ability of homebuilders to build any affordable housing. This lawsuit was the opening salvo in a battle that has lasted for almost a half-century.

On one side was the affordable housing advocates, led by urban mayors, the Fair Share Housing Center and the New Jersey Builders Association. On the other side was the NIMBYs, represented by the New Jersey State League of Municipalities representing mostly suburban and rural mayors whose voting base was strongly opposed to affordable housing. It is the “Tale of Two Cities,” where the haves and the have-nots struggle—each side claiming the moral high ground in the fight for social justice. The haves claim they have the right to determine what their community looks like in terms of housing types that will be allowed, versus the have-nots who claim you cannot use zoning to restrict where the poor can live. This battle is being waged all across America.

The battle begins

The history of the Mount Laurel doctrine is the history of a struggle for social justice. A battle with 13 rounds over 48 years, with each side claiming the moral high ground. Here is the round by round recap.

1972—The opening salvo, when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued the Town of Mount Laurel over their exclusionary zoning ordinance.

1975—The New Jersey Supreme Court issues opinion in Mount Laurel I case ruling that exclusionary zoning violated the New Jersey Constitution. Appeals are immediately filed.

1983—The New Jersey Supreme Court issues opinion in Mount Laurel II case, affirming the rulings in Mount Laurel I and providing detailed mechanisms for implementing the doctrine noteworthy for allowing the builder’s remedy. This remedy allowed a homebuilder who purchased land in a municipality to obtain the zoning approval via a court order allowing the construction of five units to the acre, provided 20 percent—one of the five units—was sold to a low-income buyer. The remedy was a means of encouraging private-sector actors to enforce the doctrine through mandatory inclusionary development.

1985—In response to intense political pressure resulting from municipal hostility to the Mount Laurel doctrine, and especially builder’s remedies, the New Jersey Legislature adopted the New Jersey Fair Housing Act in 1985. That Act sought to take exclusionary zoning disputes out of the courts through the creation of the Council on Affordable Housing. The Act placed a de facto moratorium on builder’s remedy suits and directed COAH to formulate regulations through which towns could bring themselves into compliance with their Mount Laurel obligations. The Act made builder’s remedy suits difficult to obtain, and gave towns considerable latitude in how to achieve compliance. A highly effective component of the COAH regulations was called Regional Contribution Agreements.

These RCAs allowed towns to transfer up to 50 percent of their affordable housing obligation to other communities by sending $35,000 per affordable housing unit to those communities. The receiving communities were mainly cities in New Jersey that wanted more affordable housing units for their low- and moderate-income residents and were looking for ways to finance it. Our construction company took advantage of these RCAs by partnering with community and faith-based nonprofits as well as for-profit affordable housing development companies. In the following years, we built over 1,000 affordable housing units in Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, and Trenton, N.J.

1987 to 1993—COAH’s first round took over a year to get up and running. The process worked fairly well under the first-round regulations.

1987 to 1999 – COAH’s “second round” was actually 1993-1999 but they made the first and second rounds cumulative. That process also worked fairly well under the “second round regulations.”

1999—Due to a political reluctance to have COAH continue to do its job, third-round regulations, which were due by the end of 1999, were not adopted on time.

2004—After much litigation, third-round rules were ultimately adopted by COAH in December. COAH started processing some towns’ petitions for substantive certification, but those regulations were invalidated on appeal. The “growth share” concept in those regulations was their central flaw, as it mandated 10 percent of all housing developments be set aside for affordable housing, without regard for need and without any offsetting compensation—like the density bonus that was automatically allowed in builder’s remedy suits. Following that appeal, COAH then adopted a second iteration of third-round regulations. Those regulations were also invalidated because they were just another version of growth share, among other flaws.

2008—Astonishingly, the FSHC lobbied the New Jersey Legislature to eliminate RCAs, and in 2008, an affordable housing bill called A-500 was passed by the legislature and signed into law. A significant change was the elimination of RCAs despite the fact that RCAs were getting affordable housing units built in great numbers, and where they were most needed. FSHC argued that RCAs were concentrating poverty in New Jersey’s cities instead of providing affordable housing opportunities throughout its suburban and rural communities. The fallacy in FSHC’s argument is that cities have always been where the poor, and often immigrant populations, start their way up the economic ladder. Most cities have neighborhoods where housing costs are low, where entry level, unskilled jobs are prevalent, and where the mass transit infrastructure provides low-cost access to those jobs.

2013—COAH then proposed yet another iteration of third-round regulations. However, when the time came to vote to adopt these regulations, COAH deadlocked with a 3-3 vote. Thus, no new regulations were adopted, and back to the courts it went.

2015—The matter went back to the New Jersey Supreme Court on a motion in aid of litigant’s rights. On March 15, 2015, that court released the opinion that has come to be known as the Mount Laurel IV opinion. That opinion declared COAH “moribund” and directed a process through which towns could file declaratory judgment cases in the trial courts, basically seeking the same type of approval COAH used to grant when it was lawfully operating. The trial courts were also directed to develop standards, including fair share numbers, using COAH’s second-round regulation standards as a model.

2018—Trial court Judge Mary Jacobson developed standards and fair share numbers in the consolidated Mercer County DJ cases after a 42-day trial. Courts throughout the state began using these fair share numbers—aka Mount Laurel IV—and began routinely granting immunity to compliant towns against builder’s remedy suits. In rough numbers, about 340 DJ cases were filed, and all but 40 or so have been settled.

2020—The municipalities that are left are mostly “bad actors,” and continued immunity from builder’s remedy suits is being seriously challenged in some of those localities. For example, counsel for NJBA and a builder member recently had Judge Christine Farrington in Bergen County terminate the immunity that Englewood Cliffs had, and counsel was authorized to file a builder’s remedy suit. Judge Farrington has since granted that builder’s remedy—600 units with 20 percent affordable housing—and more builder’s remedy claims will likely follow in other cases.

NJBA, together with the FSHC, was involved in all the various suits throughout the decades on behalf of the homebuilding industry. NJBA alone spent $334,000 between June 2015 and July 2017. Over 340 towns participated in this process. The remaining 227 municipalities were either urban aid municipalities—cities that have no affordable housing obligation—or municipalities with no available developable land or no market demand for housing of any type.

In many of the builder’s remedy actions described above, NJBA filed as amici alongside the builder, so in total, over the last 50 years, tens of millions of dollars have been spent in litigation. How many affordable housing units could have been financed and built in New Jersey if that money had been invested in housing? Not included in these numbers is the collateral damage, the cost of abandoned projects, unimproved sites, lost jobs, lost tax ratables, and the lost opportunities to provide both market-rate and affordable housing over the last half-century. These costs are incalculable.

Pain points

So, what have we learned from 50 years of litigation over where, how much, and how New Jersey will finance housing for its low- and moderate-income citizens?

One pain point is obvious. It is that New Jersey is a “home rule” state, meaning most land use approvals are done at the municipal level. Almost all of New Jersey’s 567 municipalities control all land-use decisions within their borders, a system that guarantees local opinion trumps regional need. Planning Boards and zoning boards of adjustment are supposed to be nonpartisan quasi-judicial interpreters of the zoning ordinance in their town or city.

A planning board’s role is to approve developments that meet the existing zoning code standards. A ZBA is where an applicant goes when seeking to introduce a use that is not permitted within a particular zone, thereby requiring a change in use. The Municipal Land Use Law authorizes a local ZBA to grant a use variance where the burden of proof by the applicant is to demonstrate 1. “Special reasons” exist for the variance—the positive criteria. 2. The variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purposes of the zone plan and zoning ordinance—the negative criteria.

Because the members of these boards are appointed by the local politicians, they are actually quasi-political. In New Jersey, planning boards frequently deny fully compliant applications and ZBA’s deny use-change applications—notwithstanding the fact that the applicant met their burden of proof—because they were instructed to deny it by the mayor, after he or she received complaints from some politically connected supporter or neighborhood group. The developer can go to court for relief, but that can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Developers often do not have the time, money or inclination to fight the establishment, so they walk away, rather than buck the political leadership and risk retribution on their next project.

There is a solution to the problem of home rule as it relates to affordable housing. Zoning applications for affordable housing must be taken beyond the purview of municipal control. Interestingly, the seeds of the solution already appear in the Municipal Land Use Law. In 2000, the MLUL was amended to provide a new definition of “inherently beneficial use” as follows, “A use which is universally considered of value to the community because it fundamentally serves the public good and promotes the general welfare” (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4).

Inherently beneficial uses specifically listed in the legislation include, but are not limited to, hospitals, schools, childcare centers, group homes for the developmentally disabled, and wind, solar or photovoltaic energy facilities. In the years since adoption, the courts have decided cases wherein a number of inherently beneficial uses were added, such as churches and other places of worship, community shelters, senior housing, public utility installations, health care facilities for the elderly, and schools for the developmentally disabled.

Unfortunately, court decisions regarding whether affordable housing is an inherently beneficial use have provided conflicting results, and therefore are not helpful for affordable housing developers who would have relished a more consistent and reliable result. In 2000, if the legislature had gone just one step further when they amended the MLUL to clearly include affordable housing as an inherently beneficial use, the battle to produce affordable housing would have been over, with affordable housing advocates being the winner, and the floodgates for zoning applications for affordable housing would have been thrown wide open.

Another pain point is the challenge in financing the development of affordable housing because, without a subsidy, affordable housing does not make economic sense. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides 4 percent and 9 percent tax credits to affordable housing developers. These make good economic sense because they are a one-time upfront subsidy. The downside is that these tax credits are in limited supply and applications to qualify for them are extremely competitive.

Additionally, there are inherent barriers to entry, as HUD typically only awards these tax credits to affordable housing developers with a long track record and a big balance sheet. HUD also offers the Section 8 housing vouchers to qualified low-income families. These vouchers are immensely helpful, as the tenants can rent any apartment they like from market-rate rental projects. HUD subsidizes the gap between the amount the low-income family pays—30 percent of their income—and the free-market rent being charged. The downside is that there is a limited supply of these vouchers, and they are annuitized and therefore an ever-increasing burden on the tax-paying segment of the population, over time.

If a municipality was favorably inclined to expand their supply of affordable housing, they could subsidize it via zoning-based incentives like density, height or bulk standard bonuses. They also can grant tax abatements, provide free land, grant relief from costly parking requirements, and eliminate permitting and utility connection fees, and other innovative and compensating trade-offs. New Jersey has explored the re-purposing of under-utilized office and retail sites in suburban and rural areas, referred to as “stranded assets,” by granting them as-of-right rezoning to residential use, but this initiative became legislatively bogged down when the affordable housing advocates insisted that such rezoning must provide for an affordable housing component.

Conclusions

The severe shortage of affordable housing is the symptom of the problem. Poverty is the real culprit. The three critical needs of people and families are not only a safe and affordable home, but also the ability to develop their talents, obtain vocational or college education and have a support group that creates stable families. So, affordable housing is one important element, but it should be made available with the other core requirements of education and jobs.

The process for gaining approvals for affordable housing must be made faster and more predictable—classified as an inherently beneficial use to circumvent NIMBY-ism. We must expedite the process for adjudicating appeals from zoning approvals that include affordable housing.

We need to expand the kinds of taxpayer-funded, one-time, front-end subsidy programs for affordable housing, and encourage the expansion of existing subsidy programs through HUD, state and county-level sources.

Lastly, we can use the power of zoning to create the necessary subsidies for providing more affordable and market-rate housing that comes at no additional cost to the taxpayers.

While the number of cost-burdened renters reaches near record highs and the supply of low-cost rentals dips to all-time lows, the need for affordable housing is more urgent than ever.

Governments grappling with the housing gap recognize the massive scope of this problem, often leaning on private companies to fund developments and increase the housing supply for low-income earners. Investing $11.6 billion in affordable housing since 2007, few companies have solidified their commitment more than Capital One.

“It’s absolutely critical that we all play a part in it -— private companies, governments, as well as the philanthropic sector,” said Desiree Francis, vice president of originations and community finance at Capital One. “We’re all part of the same community and want to see our neighbors thrive.”

Capital One’s Community Finance team, comprised of investment and banking specialists, partners directly with housing organizations to provide more than $1.6 billion annually to both build new affordable housing developments and enhance existing units and communities. Since the banking giant began investing in affordable housing 13 years ago, it has financed more than 128,000 affordable housing units, creating 145,000 jobs along the way.

Demand for affordable housing “far outstrips supply”

The company has reinforced its commitment to improving access to affordable housing at a critical time. According to the 2019 State of the Nation’s Housing report from Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, rental vacancy rates for affordable properties fell to 4.8 percent last year, an indicator that housing options for low-income renters remain thin. Despite the dwindling availability of inexpensive rentals — from 2011 to 2017, the stock for units rented at under $800 shrunk by 17 percent — new construction is failing to address this need. The Survey of Market Absorption reported that under 4 percent of unsubsidized multifamily buildings finished in the first quarter of 2018 rented units for less than $850.

“Demand far outstrips the supply,” Francis told TriplePundit. “Affordable housing developments in general — and [especially] in high-cost markets — tend to be fully occupied.”

Securing a low-cost or subsidized unit, particularly in high-need city markets like New York or Washington, D.C., can feel like winning the lottery, Francis said. But she and her team also recognize that their job isn’t over when residents turn the key to their new homes. Capital One has doubled down on its commitment to serve low-income renters, extending its investments well beyond construction through its Social Purpose program, as seen in places like Miami-Dade County’s Karis Village affordable housing complex.

The Karis Village affordable housing community in South Florida.

A holistic approach to affordable housing

Perched just south of the Miami Zoo in South Florida, Karis Village opened its doors to 135 low-income and formerly homeless residents in March 2018, thanks in large part to an $8 million construction loan and $25 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits purchased by Capital One. This particular development, aligning with another one of Capital One’s core missions, allots about half of its 88 units to at-risk veterans transitioning out of homelessness.

Instead of walking away following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Capital One awarded a $250,000 Social Purpose grant to Karis Village. The funds, to be spread out over a 10-year period, will provide residents with essential support services to enrich resident lives in their new homes. These services include addiction recovery programs, transportation assistance and peer-to-peer counseling.

“We look at our role not solely from the bricks of the buildings and properties,” Francis continued, “but by thinking about the residents and how we can make an impact.”

Beyond establishing programs to support the formerly homeless veterans of South Florida, the Social Purpose program has also invested in financial literacy courses and after-school programs at other properties across the U.S. In one instance, it set up a transportation system to take senior residents to their medical appointments and to the grocery store, Francis said.

Capital One is constantly looking to push the frontiers in how governments, businesses, and people address homelessness and the lack of affordable housing, Francis said. Housing policies and investments that approach problems more holistically are bound to be more successful, she continued. Policies and investments looking at the need for affordable living as solely a housing issue could fail to find permanent solutions for at-risk residents facing outside factors.

“When you think about individuals, as well as families, housing is not an isolated thing but part of other factors that families need to think about when deciding how to allocate the money that they have,” Francis told us.

Low-income families strapped with the burden of paying for rent, food, prescriptions, school supplies and other necessities are particularly vulnerable. Seemingly simple services, like those offered through Capital One’s Social Purpose program, can be the difference between living comfortably under their own roof or again facing the threat of homelessness.

This work is far from over

Affordable housing remains one of America’s most evasive problems. Before the coronavirus, the National Low-Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) estimated that 8 million U.S. renters were severely cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than half of their income on housing, and it expects this figure to rise by around 1.5 million as a result of the pandemic and related job losses.

The need is clear and well documented: An estimated 4.6 million new apartment units will have to pop up in the U.S. by 2030 to meet the booming demand. Francis acknowledges the lofty goals and hurdles that lie ahead for Capital One and its partners but meets the challenges in stride.

“Though the problem may seem insurmountable at times, through advocacy, public-private partnerships, and the testing of new and innovative ideas, I’m proud that we’re delivering positive, equitable community impact,” Francis wrote in Capital One’s 2018 Corporate Social Responsibility Report.

The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of a home this year as families have been forced to shelter in place. In addition to being a needed refuge, our residences have become offices, classrooms, and everything else in between.

As the coronavirus’ grip continues into the summer and fall, affordable housing architects are thinking about ways their projects can meet the changing health and lifestyle needs of residents.

“In these uncertain times, we are seeing developers requesting alternate approaches to design that can better adapt to a pandemic like COVID-19,” says Joanne Horton, residential studio director at RDL Architects. “I think all of the precautions people are now taking, with their adaptations in routine and lifestyle, are here to stay at some capacity, even after this current pandemic is over. This will inherently change how we look at affordable housing design.”

1.Inside Apartments

The RDL team is “studying concepts to provide more private entrances to individual units within multifamily developments. Essentially limiting the amount of shared circulation space between residents,” Horton says.

In addition to adopting new safety practices, people have had to convert their apartments to do double duty.

“There will be a bigger emphasis on work from home. I think the world is changing and adapting and seeing that it can work,” says David Layman, president and CEO of the Hooker DeJong architectural and engineering firm.

It’s a trend that will likely continue even post-pandemic, with many companies finding it beneficial for workers and their firms because less leasable office space would be needed, agrees Erik Okland, principal of the Cuningham Group architectural firm

“As affordable apartment square footages continue to shrink, co-working spaces, which provide individual glassed-in cubicles and conference areas that can be checked out for meetings, will be highly sought-after amenities for tenants,” he says.

2. Better Internet

Going hand in hand with the working-from-home trend is the need for fast, reliable internet connections.

Some state housing finance agencies (HFAs) have threshold requirements for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) properties to have high-speed internet, and that feature is going to be increasingly important, Layman says.

It is also critical that connections do not drop while working from home, adds Okland. “Wi-Fi is a standard at most apartments these days, but many residents are now asking for hard-wired internet connections,” he says. “This is due to their increased speed and the fact that some companies require a physical hard-wired connection for security.”

3. Community Spaces

Common areas such as fitness rooms and community centers have been shuttered this year in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Flexibility is always a strong design influence and will be going forward, according to Layman.

The Hooker DeJong team has been looking at ways to adapt its own offices to be “socially distancing friendly,” including possibly adding mobile partitions to provide barriers between colleagues. Some of these ideas may apply to fitness rooms and other common spaces at affordable housing developments.

“Common spaces are designed around programmatic needs, and those needs can vary greatly,” Horton says. “However, flexibility in use and adaptability of a space will be critical. If there is a need for a larger event space, we should include things like movable partitions or paneled wall systems to divide the space if needed. When larger event spaces are not needed, and the focus is geared to strictly resident gatherings, we can look at creating decentralized ‘neighborhood’ rooms, which would limit access to individuals within a specific area of a building. I believe there will also be a push to eliminate or reduce spaces that can become undesirable congregational areas, such as lobbies or enclosed mail rooms. I think we’ll also see a large movement toward virtual socialization across demographics. We’ll see this via the use multimedia applications such as electronic bulletin boards, message centers, and virtual meeting software.”

4. The Great Outdoors

One trend that may be accelerated as a result of the pandemic is the desire for walkable communities, according to Layman, noting that many state HFAs provide points in their LIHTC qualified allocation plans to projects that are near public transit, health care, stores, and other services.

Looking ahead, there may be even more emphasis on outdoor spaces that give residents the opportunity to exercise as well as practice social distancing, he says. Community gardens are a popular feature at many affordable housing properties, and that’s a communal activity that people have still been able to enjoy during the pandemic.

Okland emphasizes that community rooms and other public areas should be “designed to connect to the outdoors with large openings, including overhead doors or folding door systems. These large openings provide natural ventilation and fresh air for residents to more safely congregate.”

“At the very least, rooms should have several operable windows when larger openings cannot be accommodated due to cost or configuration,” he says. “Public areas should also be designed with higher mechanical ventilation rates, since there are times when weather prevents using natural ventilation, such as in the winter months.”

5. Products and Materials

“I definitely think we’ll see an increased demand for touchless features and fixtures,” Horton says, citing touchless light switches, sinks, toilets, hands-free intercom systems, voice-activated technology, and motion-control door sensors as some examples. “The use of surfaces and furniture that are easy to clean will become the primary focus within common areas. How we look at HVAC systems will also change. We’ll likely see more ERV [energy recovery ventilation] systems for common spaces, HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters, HVAC duct sanitizers, portable air purifiers, and separately zoned mechanical systems to various floors and common rooms to minimize transfer between spaces.”","Cooperthwaite ProductionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of a home this year as families have been forced to shelter in place.

He got sick, suddenly, at the end of January. He spent most of February in and out of the hospital, major surgery along the way. As he recuperated in bed, scrolling the internet, he watched the coronavirus emergency grow larger, and closer to his home in Eugene, Oregon.

“As Covid hit,” the 51-year-old, who asked to be identified only by his first name and last initial for privacy reasons, told me, “I’m just trying to get back on my feet. And that just wasn’t happening.”

A self-employed video editor and producer, Joaquín saw his business ground to a halt as he recovered, and it remained that way as the country teetered on the brink of both a public health and economic crisis. He got a job delivering groceries with Instacart, but the spots got scooped up quickly.

Then the seriousness of Covid-19 seeped in, and the Instacart gigs finally materialized — everyone wanted their food delivered now. But by then Joaquín wasn’t sure about going to the supermarket, touching everyone’s groceries, and risking infection every trip to the store. His is a household of seven, including him, his partner, and five dependents, the youngest of whom are toddlers.

“If I get sick,” he said, “the house is doomed.”

Like many others, he tried to contact the local pandemic unemployment office, but he couldn’t get through. He got work as a census taker. He said he was approved, passed the background check, got fingerprinted. But the training and the actual census work remain on hold for now, he said.

Joaquín has managed to pay his rent, in full, every month. His mother helped out, but she can’t do that much longer as she has her own expenses to consider. He is clawing together money where he can, borrowing $100 here or selling stuff on eBay. Others are being flexible about bills, so there’s still electricity and car insurance. But each delay means a little more debt.

He doesn’t really know what’s going to happen next or how he’ll keep paying rent. He’s protected from eviction until at least September, after Oregon’s governor signed legislation last Tuesday that extended the state’s moratorium and gives tenants until March 31, 2021, to pay back rent. But none of it solves the underlying problem, which is that the pandemic and the economic crisis are making it impossible to catch up. On rent, on utilities, on all of it.

“What does a person do if they have to feed their family, and they can’t? Say they’re willing to work, but they can’t even find it,” Joaquín said. “What do they do?”

It’s a question many Americans are struggling with right now. More than four months into the coronavirus pandemic, the United States is in a sustained crisis: old coronavirus hot spots replaced by new ones, more than 130,000 people dead, the country’s case count rising to record levels and then breaking those records almost daily.

The public health catastrophe is paired with an economic one. The United States has an unemployment rate of over 11 percent, with more than 19 million people still receiving jobless benefits as of July 2. The persistence of the pandemic has forced some states and localities to scale back their reopening — bars closed, again, and no indoor dining. Such a recovery, happening in fits and starts, means job security could remain fragile for millions in the months and weeks ahead.

This has left many, like Joaquín, unsure how they’ll meet expenses, including one of the biggest: rent.

A crisis always loomed. A patchwork of eviction moratoriums across the country and benefits from the CARES Act, including a one-time stimulus check and expanded unemployment benefits of $600 per week (which were also made available to self-employed and gig workers), helped forestall the catastrophe. Those policies helped keep people in their homes during the unprecedented health crisis and supplemented income so they could still pay their bills.

But housing courts are reopening, and eviction moratoriums are expiring in the coming weeks, if they haven’t already. CARES Act benefits that expanded unemployment are running out. Unless lawmakers intervene, the $600-per-week supplement will expire at the end of July.

“The United States is facing an eviction crisis of biblical proportions,” Aaron Carr, founder and executive director of the Housing Rights Initiative, a nonprofit housing watchdog group, told me. “Allowing eviction moratoriums and expanded unemployment benefits to expire will undoubtedly lead to a perfect storm of instability, homelessness, and human suffering.”

Experts, housing activists, and renters themselves fear what could happen if there is no relief, and soon. Even before the pandemic, renters tended to be lower-income and spent a greater share of their income on housing costs compared to homeowners. A June 15 report from the Urban Institute estimates that 8.9 million households — about 20 percent of all renter households — have at least one member who’s lost a job between February and April.

“We don’t want what was originally a health crisis turned into a job crisis then now to become a housing crisis and a crisis of housing instability as people are evicted from their homes,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor and faculty director at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.

Some renters and tenant organizers are engaged in rent strikes — sometimes because they don’t have any other options — to win concessions from landlords. Mutual aid coalitions, collectives of community members helping each other, are filling cracks where they can, though it isn’t enough to fully plug the gaps.

Advocates are calling on lawmakers to cancel rent for the duration of the crisis, and to cancel or pause mortgages so that landlords can also survive. Some have suggested a nationwide eviction moratorium to unify the patchwork of confusing state and local policies. And many are calling for more money: more stimulus, renewed unemployment benefits, and, most critically, robust housing assistance to keep people in their homes and landlords afloat.

But experts and advocates say the pandemic didn’t create the housing crisis; it merely exposed what already existed. “You’re always one financial shock, one financial emergency from not being able to pay the rent, and potentially being evicted, and, in the worst cases, facing homelessness,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. “And for many of these same renters, the coronavirus is that financial emergency.”

America had an affordable housing crisis. Then came the pandemic.

America’s renters were already vulnerable before the coronavirus arrived.

“It’s important to remember that even before this pandemic, we were facing a rental affordability crisis that’s been building over the last few decades,” Ellen, of the Furman Center, said. She called it a “backdrop of need.”

Before the pandemic, of America’s nearly 43 million renters, about 20.8 million — almost half — were “cost-burdened,” meaning more than 30 percent of their income went to housing costs, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. Of those, about 10.9 million renter households were “severely burdened,” spending more than 50 percent of their income on rent.

America lacks an adequate supply of affordable housing. The National Low-Income Housing Coalition found a shortage of about 7 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. Of those Americans who are eligible for some sort of federal rental assistance, just one in five actually receive it. (Other estimates put it at one in four.)

This gaping need means that an economic shock far shallower than the coronavirus-caused one can upend renters’ already fragile security. But while “the economic impacts of Covid are unprecedented and they’re widespread,” Ellen noted, “the effects on renters have been particularly devastating, and will continue to be.”

“The United States is facing an eviction crisis of biblical proportions”

For instance, renters are more likely to work in sectors like the service industry that were hit hardest by the pandemic. An analysis by the Furman Center found that in New York City, the renters most likely to face economic disruption because of the pandemic may pay lower rent but generally face higher rent burdens, which will exacerbate any sudden loss of income. “They’re more likely to suffer Covid-related job loss than homeowners, and then, meanwhile, they don’t have any savings to speak of, to cover those income shortfalls,” Ellen said.

That same study also found that those New York renters vulnerable to pandemic disruptions also tend to live in smaller buildings where the landlords don’t have a cushion if tenants fall behind on rent. That means owners may struggle to maintain their buildings and pay their mortgages and property taxes. That could affect city and state budgets, just as the need for services increases.

This will be duplicated elsewhere. All of it is a recipe for a housing crisis.

Eviction moratoriums postponed a massive housing catastrophe. They’re starting to end.

As states and cities locked down in March and April to slow the spread of the coronavirus, at least 42 states and the District of Columbia put some sort of eviction moratorium in place to stop people from losing their homes if they can’t pay rent.

That number has dwindled to about two dozen as of late June, and many states are allowing landlords to file cases in court, even if tenants can’t immediately be evicted. Still, some moratoriums have ended completely and evictions are beginning to happen, including in some coronavirus hot spots, like Texas.

The CARES Act-mandated 120-day moratorium on evictions in houses with federal backing sunsets after July 24, though it requires a 30-day notice period, so landlords can’t force someone out of their home until August 25. But this doesn’t cover all renters.

The Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, a Colorado-based legal project, estimates that between 19 million and 23 million renters are at risk of eviction by the end of September. “The ‘cliff’s edge,’ as it were, it’s real,” Samantha Batko, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, told me. “Eviction moratoriums are ending. People are being evicted.”

“I think that we definitely have not seen the worst of it,” Linda Morris, Skadden fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, told me. “I think we’re just seeing the very beginning of it. Especially as some states are beginning to lift their moratorium, we’re beginning to see higher numbers of evictions going forward.”

The end of moratoriums, she said, “is going to open up the floodgates.”

Landlords in New York City were able to start filing evictions, by mail, on June 22, though few were filed and an order from the courts stayed proceedings until at least July 7. An eviction moratorium is in place in New York state for those experiencing a “financial hardship” or unemployment linked to Covid-19.

At the end of June, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the Tenant Safe Harbor Act, which codified the moratorium and would prevent evictions for nonpayment between March 7 and a future date, when all Covid-19 restrictions lift. But it does not stop courts from handing down money judgments for unpaid rent during that period, and the definition of financial hardship is flexible.

The opaque and shifting rules add to the stress for tenants, and they are worried about how, and when, they might end up on the housing court docket.

Allilsa Fernandez is among them. The 36-year-old New Yorker lives in the Briarwood neighborhood of Queens, in the same apartment she’s been in for three years. She says she’s always paid her rent on time, but in the middle of the crisis, her landlord told her he was raising the rent $100 in April. But $100 was a lot.

Fernandez, a disability rights and mental health advocate, is working part-time from home. She has asthma and is worried about her coronavirus risk. Her partner, who normally goes 50/50 on the rent, babysits, and she lost most of her income when the pandemic started. One family still pays her, but it comes in spurts.

Fernandez paid her rent in April, though not the extra $100 her landlord demanded. In May, she asked the landlord to use her security deposit to cover the monthly rent, something Cuomo had sanctioned. She said he didn’t do that, and she’s stopped paying rent since, expecting to hash it out in housing court. She hopes it will go in her favor, but she says you never know — and even if it does, she might still have to leave.

“I’m really, really, really afraid of being homeless. I’ve been afraid of being homeless. I don’t know what this means for me,” Fernandez said. “Finding an apartment right now, in the middle of the pandemic, is tough. And I’m at high risk; it’s not like I’m healthy and I can say, ‘Oh, I’ll take that risk.’”

Fernandez has put her energy into organizing. She’s finding housing resources for herself and others, and she’s protesting. She wants to see a full cancellation of rent and a rent freeze (meaning landlords can’t increase rent) for a year, at least until people can get back on their feet. But those lifelines may not arrive.

“During normal times, evictions are bad. During pandemic times, they are catastrophic,” Carr, of Housing Rights Initiative, said. “Because in this case, you have a combination of a housing crisis, a homelessness crisis, a health crisis, an economic crisis, and unemployment crisis that, left unchecked, will be nothing short of an unmitigated disaster.”

Advocates also point out that many housing courts, even if they’re reopening, haven’t gotten back to business as usual. Social distancing measures mean localities are still trying to figure out how to adjudicate cases while adhering to social distancing rules and safety requirements. Some jurisdictions are trying remote hearings, which advocates say disadvantages renters, especially low-income ones, who may not have internet access. Language and interpretation access is also a concern.

“What if that low-income renter doesn’t have a computer available to them? Doesn’t have access to internet? Are they then seen as having not shown up for their eviction case?” Yentel, of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, said. “And is that a strike against them from the start? Which is just extraordinarily unfair, clearly, and unjust.”

Reports have also documented landlords executing illegal evictions, either pressuring tenants to leave or taking more forceful measures like changing locks and throwing people’s belongings out onto the street.

Julian Smith-Newman, a member of the Los Angeles Tenants Union, a member-funded housing advocacy group, said members of his organization have taken on “eviction blockades,” a kind of rapid response to illegal evictions in which members try to help people get back into their homes, sometimes even confronting law enforcement who are unaware the evictions are illegal.

But landlords are also under pressure from these moratoriums. Smaller or mom-and-pop landlords can’t go months without the rent, either. Some landlords have said the moratoriums threaten their livelihoods, and some have sued to end the protections.

This is why these moratoriums were always short-term solutions that merely “kicked the can down the road,” experts told me. They were necessary, but vastly insufficient, measures.

In pre-pandemic times, evictions exacerbated inequalities in housing. According to the ACLU, on average, Black renters had evictions filed against them at nearly twice the rate of white renters. “And those disparities are often worse for Black women tenants in particular, who have the greatest risk of having an eviction filed against them,” Morris, of the ACLU, said. “And so what we are certain about is that the pandemic is only going to worsen those existing disparities.”

A rash of evictions could also lead to increased homelessness, one that will strain state and local budgets that are already slashing services. An analysis by a professor at Columbia University estimated that homelessness could increase by 40 to 45 percent this year — adding an additional 250,000 people, leaving approximately 800,000 people houseless nationwide.

This, in turn, will exacerbate all the other crises, experts told me. “It’s a public health risk, obviously, in terms of being able to maintain social distancing,” Alex Schwartz, an urban policy professor at the New School, said. But it becomes even more expensive to help unhoused people — and, again, city and local budgets are already strained and cutting back on social services.

Evictions come with their own longer-term health crises. It is harder to find stable housing in the future, which disrupts everything from job stability to health to kids’ academic progress.

“I think that this is a life-or-death situation for people,” Brennan Stultz, a 33-year-old Williamsburg resident who helped found the Action: New York City Rent Strike on Facebook, told me.

“We could see mass homelessness if they start doing virtual hearings, if they find ways to expedite eviction orders, and things of this nature,” he said. “You could see hundreds of thousands of people lose their home, while we’re still fighting a pandemic across the world.”

How tenants are trying to navigate this crisis

About 30 apartments are on rent strike at 345 Eldert Street, in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn.

They’ve lost about half a dozen apartments along the way — out of fear, or because some struck their own deals with the management company. It undermines the strike and the attempt to bargain collectively. But Cian O’Day, a spokesperson for the 345 Eldert Tenants’ Association, told me everyone understood. It wasn’t like anyone had been in this situation before.

On June 1, the tenants’ association hung a #CancelRent banner from the building. The management company rented a cherry picker to take it down. Word around the building was that the management company rented the machine for $1,000 a week. The management company did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

The exact cost was less important than what the story symbolized: that the landlord wouldn’t give an out-of-work tenant a break on the rent but would spend money to take down a sign. The cherry picker sat there for two weeks.

Rent strikes, like the one in O’Day’s building, have popped up around the country as renters try to pressure both landlords and local governments to do something, anything, about the rent. Solidarity and necessity are driving the movement.

“It’s weird,” O’Day said. “It’s like the scariest time and still, some of the most beautiful shit is happening because people are looking out for each other.”

Stultz, who helped start the Action: New York City Rent Strike group, said they host Zoom meetings, share resources, and connect renters across the city with legal aid. They are building a community, even if they all live in different parts of the city. “[We’re] providing a forum for people to discuss these issues between each other, and maybe take comfort from the fact that they’re not alone in this fight to pay rent,” he said.

Cea Weaver, a campaign coordinator with Housing Justice for All, a coalition of New York state advocacy groups pushing to cancel rent and immediately rehouse homeless people in vacant housing, said that tenant organizing has increased during the pandemic, but it’s also hitting a crossroads right now. The question is whether landlords will still consider bargaining, or if they’ll just take tenants to court for nonpayment. “Right now, it’s just not clear,” she said.

Because in New York City, and in many other places across the country, people are running out of options. Nothing has really changed; the pandemic continues. Only now, in lots of places, housing courts are reopening.

“There’s ultimately nothing really keeping people in their homes. We keep pushing this cliff further and further down the road, but officially, we’re still going to hit this point where the courts are going to be open,” Jesse Connor, an organizer for Autonomous Tenants Union in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, told me. “Where evictions are going to be filed and where people ... are not going to be able to pay what they owe and they will be at risk of being put out on the street.”

Desiree Kane, a neighbor organizing with Colorado Rent Strike and Eviction Defense, a Facebook group of more than 4,200 members, said the group has been looking toward this moment for months. “It’s going to start getting extremely serious for a lot of people,” she said.

Kane said that, statewide, they’ve heard reports of people leaving their homes, maybe moving to their vehicle, or taking an RV to temporary campgrounds. Last week, Denver’s mayor announced the city would set aside “managed campgrounds” for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic.

Eilise Gancarz-Davies, a member of the New Orleans Renters Rights Assembly, told me her organization is worried about a double-whammy of evictions. The first are those people who had cases filed before the pandemic, who are now first in line for housing court. “That’s the wave that’s coming already,” she said. “And then on top of that, there’s this whole other wave of pandemic evictions.”

Gancarz-Davies said this will push more and more families together into shared housing, which still poses a health risk. “The options are getting slimmer and slimmer and scarier and scarier,” she said.

Mutual aid coalitions are trying to fill some of the gaps, especially among vulnerable folks who don’t qualify for benefits. The coalitions are also aiding people who’ve never really needed help before and are intimidated or embarrassed to seek government help — or have been deterred from doing so because the system itself failed.

Al Rios fields requests for the North Texas Mutual Aid Coalition, which broadly covers the Dallas-Fort Worth area. When he first started managing requests for the coalition in April, the asks were small: some extra cash for groceries, a hundred bucks to cover the cellphone bill.

“The latest thing, probably since May, the biggest thing is people need money for rent and so that’s what they’re asking for,” he said. The number of people who need help has also gone up.

Some are short a few hundred on rent this month, but they don’t know what the next month will bring. Rios will give those folks an even $1,000. Some requests are much more desperate: unemployed people, needing months of back rent, reaching into the thousands of dollars. Rios gives what he cans, then bumps them to the bottom of the list.

And the group is still weeks behind in fielding requests. They are dependent on donations, and the need far exceeds what they’re receiving. In one case, Rios recalls, someone with Covid-19 needed aid. He had died by the time they got to his name.

What experts and activists say the governments should be doing

Tenant organizations and activists want state and local governments to cancel rent for the duration of the pandemic and pause mortgages for the length of the emergency — which remains acute in the United States.

Canceling rent would be radical, though tenants groups and activists say that kind of bold action is necessary. Erasing rent would also require some sort of assistance for people with mortgages — and for utility companies and local governments that rely on property taxes for funding.

Then there are the mortgage lenders who would need to get on board. Many mortgages are bundled and sold as investments to things like pension funds, which could take a hit if lenders can’t pay out investors. America’s for-profit housing system is so interconnected it may make a clean slate harder than it sounds.

But the status quo is also untenable. All experts and activists I spoke to agree: If nothing is done, it will be disastrous. The urgency can’t be overstated. “We need this emergency rental assistance now, and that emergency rental assistance will stem the tide [of evictions] and keep people on the brink from losing their homes,” Yentel said.

People I spoke to said more money from the federal government would be a good place to start. Renewing expanded unemployment benefits for additional weeks or sending additional stimulus checks would give renters a boost. So would laying aside billions in rental assistance, money to cover rent and back rent and keep people safely housed during the pandemic.

The June 15 Urban Institute report estimated that the federal government would need to spend $5.5 billion each month to bring all renter households back up to the pre-pandemic rent burden — which would still mean some households remain severely burdened, paying more than 30 percent in rent. (To get everyone to that 30 percent figure, it would cost $15.5 billion per month.)

That $5.5 billion figure goes down, however, to $1.8 billion if it is paired with continuing supplements like state and expanded unemployment benefits.

Any program should consider not just future rent but also covering arrears, experts tell me. Rental assistance would also help guarantee the viability of the country’s housing stock, allowing small landlords to operate and maintain their buildings — something they can’t do if rent isn’t coming in.

“There is real concern that landlords may not be able to weather this as well,” Batko, of Urban Institute, said.

Democrats in the House passed a $3 trillion stimulus package in May. The HEROES Act, as it’s called, also comes with additional cash stimulus, expanded unemployment insurance, and almost $200 billion in financial support for housing and homelessness programs, including $100 billion for emergency rental assistance. That money would keep payment flowing to landlords, especially smaller ones who may rely on rental income to pay for building maintenance, utilities, mortgages, taxes, and other expenses.

It would also expand a nationwide eviction moratorium for nonpayment to include most renters, erasing the confusing patchwork of state and local policies, and dole out more money to help cash-strapped states and cities.

But the HEROES Act has languished in the Republican-led Senate, and Congress is now on a two-week July Fourth holiday. Even if the Senate acts quickly and passes the stimulus package upon their return, the delay could be costly.

As with any large-scale aid program, it takes time to set up and distribute money. That could create a gap between when people desperately need funds and when they’re available. That doesn’t give struggling renters much leeway.

Plus, July 1 marked the start of the fiscal year for many cities and states, meaning they’ve already agreed on pared-back budgets, which in some cases could mean cuts to social services and other safety net programs.

The House also passed a standalone rental bill last week — the Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act of 2020, which sets aside $100 billion for emergency rental assistance programs and a $75 billion relief fund for homeowners. It also extends the eviction and foreclosure moratorium in the CARES Act through March 2021. It probably won’t make it through the Senate.

Even if eviction moratoriums are imperfect, they are still an important stopgap to keep people in their homes during a health emergency — especially for people who can’t qualify for assistance or who work in the informal economy, such as unauthorized immigrants.

Advocates say a national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment could provide this lifeline. “I do think a national rule would be the most effective, because I think what you’re seeing now in this patchwork is really confusing to people,” Navneet Grewal, litigation counsel for Disability Rights California, told me.

The House and Senate have introduced a bill to extend a nationwide eviction moratorium through March 2021 and expand it to include almost all renters. The odds of this standalone bill also becoming law are slim.

With federal action stalled, states and localities — even with strained budgets — might have to fill the gaps, though the need far outstrips available funds. Los Angeles has approved a $100 million rental assistance program, but it will cap payments at $2,000 per household, in one of America’s priciest rental markets. New York state also approved a $100 million rental assistance program, though applicants have to meet certain income requirements. In Houston, Texas, a $15 million rental assistance program filled up in 90 minutes.

Experts and advocates say local governments also need to think beyond rental assistance and figure out ways to stop housing courts from being overwhelmed with a wave of new evictions — not to mention the pre-pandemic backlog.

Expanding tenants’ rights to counsel and legal aid would guarantee renters have representation when they go to housing court. “Evictions are a really fast process; they’re much faster than most civil cases,” Grewal said. There aren’t enough lawyers for people who are being evicted, she said, “and having a lawyer actually makes an enormous difference.”

Local governments could also seek to boost programs that help mediate between landlords and tenants, keeping everyone out of housing court. Tenants may still have to pay back rent and may still have to leave, but they can avoid having an eviction on their record. And, of course, local eviction moratoriums continue to help.

“We need to buy ourselves some time here,” Carr said, “while we push the federal government to get their shit together.”

The pandemic, and protests, is an opportunity to rethink housing

On June 1, protests against police brutality and racism engulfed the country. Also, the rent was due.

The protests connected to the Black Live Matter movement helped highlight inequities in housing — and law enforcement’s role in it. When evictions start happening, Weaver pointed out, “It’s going to be law enforcement that’s going to be taking people out of their homes.”

Tenant organizers and activists say their work always connected to larger anti-racism and social justice efforts, but others are waking up now, too. “Anything that we do that upholds systemic inequity is up for revision right now in this moment,” Kane, with the Colorado Rent Strike and Eviction Defense, told me. “There’s an awakening happening.”

And the pandemic, with housing courts closed and millions in extreme, acute economic distress, has presented a unique opportunity for tenants to organize and take action. Without assistance, tenants had no choice. “Necessity,” Jack Lester, a housing attorney in New York City who’s working with 345 Eldert Street rent strikers, told me, “always creates historical movements.”

This also means reexamining the problems that existed before the pandemic and figuring out how policies and public action can remedy those, too.

Emily Mock, Chinatown Tenants Union Membership Organizer, works with mainly immigrant communities in New York City’s shrinking Chinatown. Mock said those she works with experience the threat of evictions constantly: landlords who purposely don’t cash rent checks to try to kick tenants out, housing court proceedings that stretch for years.

That didn’t go away when the pandemic struck, she said, and leaving it unaddressed will only widen inequities among renters. “One of the ways in which working-class people have been really deeply insulted by this is that I’ll need to prove that you’re impacted by the pandemic” to receive certain assistance. “When, of course, everybody is impacted.”

“Everything comes together,” she said.

“Anything that we do that upholds systemic inequity is up for revision right now in this moment”

Emmanuel Pardilla, a volunteer tenant organizer with the South Bronx Tenant Movement, said the same for tenants in the South Bronx. Many in his neighborhood work in the informal economy, like selling fruit or churros. It is harder for them to “prove” they’ve been hurt by the pandemic.

And many of the communities who are at the biggest risk of eviction and homelessness are also those hit hardest by the pandemic.

“So when we’re talking about people staying home, they’re staying home in buildings, in apartments where they have mold growing, where they have leaks, where they have vermin, which are all triggers of asthma, which is a respiratory issue just as Covid is a respiratory issue,” Pardilla said. “So people are still getting sick, whether they’re staying home or not.”

Even if the country and economy were to immediately snap back, “normalcy” is still tenuous for millions of renters. Emergency aid is necessary, but making these programs more permanent could also help prevent the next crisis from happening.

The government could invest more in programs that offer housing vouchers, such as Section 8 (where the government pays a portion of a tenant’s rent, based on income). Right now, the waitlists for programs like Section 8 are extraordinarily, almost absurdly long, despite limits on eligibility.

Strengthening protections and expanding access to these initiatives would help keep people in the houses or apartments they already have and prevent them from reaching the point of crisis, like eviction or homelessness.

“Until we solve for that underlying shortage of homes affordable and available to the lowest-income people, then we’re going to face the same crisis during the next pandemic or the next wave of this pandemic or the next natural disaster next year,” Yentel said. “Because this is a crisis on top of a multi-year, already existing affordable housing crisis.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the South Bronx Tenants Movement as the South Bronx Tenants Association. The post has been updated, and we regret the error.","“The United States is facing an eviction crisis of biblical proportions,” Aaron Carr, founder and executive director of the Housing Rights Initiative, a nonprofit housing watchdog group, told me.

Those considering assisted living or nursing care may be re-evaluating options and hoping to ""age in place"" and stay in their home longer.

“We are not handicapped yet, but COVID-19 made my husband & I look at living at home for as long as possible, rather than heading to a nursing home or rehab, where we might get separated. I researched converting our tub to a shower. The CleanCut solution was so much more affordable. It took only a few hours to install and it works well.” - CleanCut Customer Review (June 2020) CleanCut Bath provides a fast and affordable option for bathtub safety. Products reduce falls in the bathtub area by lowering the side wall that is required to step over to take a bath or shower. DIY Kits or Professional Installation is available.

Unfortunately, many homes are not designed to ensure safety and accessibility. A common safety hazard is falls that occur in the bathroom due to the high step that is typically required to step in and out of the bathtub. Bathroom renovations often require the removal of the existing bathtub and result in an expensive and lengthy project.

CleanCut, a manufacturer of home safety products, is pleased to provide a specialized line of bathtub inserts installed on the existing bathtub to provide easier bath accessibility installed for a fraction of the cost compared to projects that require tearing-out the existing bathtub.

Installation includes cutting and removing a section of the existing sidewall of the tub and fitting the resulting opening with the CleanCut product. Tens of thousands of products have been installed across the US and Canada by both a national network of professional installers and ""Do It Yourself"" customers. The installation process is normally completed in just two to four hours, making social distancing practices easier to follow.

The fastest growing option for installation during the pandemic has been the CleanCut Convertible® model. The Convertible® is designed to convert the existing tub into a step-in shower, but with the added benefit of being able to still utilize the tub for a full bath with the use of a removable center insert. This product option is ideal for multi-generation homes and to maintain the future resale value of the home.

This was according to PayGas founder and chief executive Philippe Hoeblich, who said yesterday that they planned the expansion following the signing of a supply agreement with Afrox, one of the South Africa's leading LPG suppliers.





Hoeblich said the new stations would allow easier, flexible access to clean gas for low-income households that cannot always afford a full cylinder.





PayGas users purchase a prepaid voucher via their cellphone, at a spaza shop or the closest pay-as-you-gas station, and use the PayGas app to fill their Afrox safety gas cylinder, totally or partially, for as little as R10, at pay-as-you-gas stations.

PayGas had rolled out a pilotstation in Delft, Cape Town, servicing more than 4 000 low-income residents in the township.





Together with Afrox and through a micro-franchising with Pick n Pay market store owners, PayGas planned to roll out five new stations in six weeks in Philippi Village, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Langa and Kayamandi.





Three additional stations were planned for Joburg, and two in Durban next year.





Afrox would install LPG dumpy tank storage vessels at each pay-as-you-gas station, and supply each station with about 2 500 cylinders to ensure sufficient cylinder stock.





Afrox LP gas business manager Gerhard van Wyk said they had identified a wide scope for growth in the informal and domestic LPG market.

Afrox LP gas business manager Gerhard van Wyk said they had identified a wide scope for growth in the informal and domestic LPG market.



While many households have electricity, wood and paraffin was still used for cooking and heating due to power shortages and the rising cost of electricity.

And while LPG was safer and cleaner than wood and paraffin, wood and paraffin could be bought in small quantities, while traditional LPG consumption meant buying a full cylinder of gas every time the cylinder was empty, preventing households with irregular income to afford gas for cooking.

“Often, low income households cannot afford to swop an empty cylinder for a full sealed one before their next pay, forcing thousands of individuals to revert to alternative sources such as paraffin, charcoal, wood or expensive grid electricity,”” said Van Wyk.The technology was powered by a pay-as-you-go USSD software payment platform combined with a cashless refilling station and mobile app, connected to a barcode on customers’ cylinders.

There have been recent reports of a shortage of LPG in the country, but Van Wyk said “we have ample gas”. He warned though that with demand traditionally surging during the winter months and load shedding, occasionally local outlets might find themselves temporarily out of gas.

“I founded PayGas in response to a gaping need for flexible affordable cooking energy for lower-income households in urban areas in South Africa and we can’t wait to execute on our ambitious plans,” said Hoeblich.

Sure it’s expensive to live in Vancouver and Toronto, but does it have to be? A new study that compares the housing affordability of major Canadian cities with U.S. metropolitan centres says no. The report by Canadian think-tank Fraser Institute found that as housing in Canada’s biggest cities became less affordable between 2006 and 2016, it became more affordable in large cities in the United States that were also seeing rising populations and income growth. “Many people make the assumption that when you have a growing, prosperous city, housing will inevitably become less affordable, and the evidence suggests otherwise,” said Steven Globerman, one of the authors of the report. The study looks at housing costs as a share of income over the decade in 396 cities in Canada and the United States to determine affordability. In the 344 American cities housing affordability increased by an average of 10.5%; in the 52 Canadian cities it decreased on average by 7.6%.

Article content Globerman uses the example of Dallas and Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, which during that decade saw the same rapid population growth and rising incomes as Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. While shelter costs relative to income fell 13% to 16% in the American cities, meaning housing became more affordable, it increased in the Canadian cities by 10.6% in Vancouver, 8.5% in Toronto and 1.8% in Montreal.

Article content Unaffordable housing is not just a problem for homebuyers, says the Fraser report, it’s a problem for the nation. Big cities that bring together businesses, workers and ideas drive economic growth and productivity. Less affordable housing can be an obstacle to workers getting higher-quality and higher-paying jobs and businesses from getting the expertise they need. “Housing affordability is crucial to attracting top talent, so municipal policymakers in Canada should investigate how American cities managed to grow and prosper while at the same time remain affordable in a way that Canadian cities have not,” Globerman said. _______________________________________________________ IN THE HOT SEAT Finance Minister Bill Morneau appears remotely Wednesday before a House of Commons committee probing a cancelled $912 million agreement for the WE Charity to run a student-volunteer program. When questioned by MPs about expenses incurred when he and his family took two trips with the WE organization in 2017, Morneau admitted that he had just repaid the expenses that day, and said they should have been paid before.

Article content Canada pulled itself out of deflation in June, with CPI climbing 0.7% year over year after two months of sub-zero readings. After posting some of the lowest inflation numbers in the world during the shutdown, Wednesday’s reading, which beat expectations, bounced Canada a bit higher than many major economies, including the United States, said BMO chief economist Douglas Porter. Here are a few fun (or not) facts from the data: Help for homebuyers — Mortgage interest costs fell in May for first time since 2017, and in June they fell 0.3% further. Meanwhile, rents rebounded in June, rising 0.6%, after slipping 0.8% in May. Chicken beats beef for bargain — Beef prices spiked 8.3% in the biggest monthly increase since 1982 as COVID-19 shut or slowed processing plants in April and May. But chicken, fresh and frozen, fell 4.4% from the month before partly because of an increase in flyer sales, said Stats Canada. Ouch, Ontario! — Electricity prices leapt 17.2% in this province from the month before, the biggest hike in almost 20 years. Ontario raised prices on June 1 after cutting prices in March in response to the pandemic. Page turner — Book prices posted their largest monthly rise on record, jumping 8.9% ____________________________________________________ With mortgage rates at outrageous lows, it’s easy for homeowners to save money by refinancing.

The first Mônot campaign

Is Eli Mizrahi modest? More like grounded in reality. Completely self-taught, this former consultant dreamed of launching his own label without ever daring to study fashion. Following a painful event in the past, he decided to overcome his doubts and barriers by launching Mônot - which means one and many at the same time- a brand on the border of ready-to-wear and couture. A child of the digital world, it was via Instagram that the 35-year-old designer formulated his business plan by working with an ESMOD professor in Beirut for the design of his creations produced in an ethical and responsible manner. On the design side, the leitmotiv is simple: sexy in your skin. “The Mônot woman is strong, powerful, confident. Basically, a female James Bond. More Sean Connery than Roger Moore.

The drop sees popular styles such as the slip-on Thirty Six shoe, which is now available with a clear vulcanized sole, at a more budget-friendly price range. But the lower price doesn’t exactly mean lower quality.

The shoes still feature elevated construction elements such as the hand-sewn design of the Ninety Seven in grey, which features a soft suede and calfskin leather upper and a lightweight EVA Vibram outsole.

Kandi. Auto EVolution for all –August 18 Virtual Event

JINHUA, CHINA, July 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “Kandi”) (NASDAQ GS: KNDI), today announced the formal launch of the most affordable pure electric automobiles (EVs) in the U.S. market, the Kandi K27 and K23 models. The cars will be sold by Kandi America, the trade name of Kandi’s wholly owned subsidiary SC Autosports, LLC. Sales will initially focus on the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

To support the launch, Kandi is unveiling a marketing campaign entitled “Kandi. Auto EVolution for all” that centers around a live virtual launch event on August 18 to kick-off pre-sales. Customers can reserve their models K27 or K23 EVs with a fully-refundable $100 deposit, which will be available for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2020.

“Electric vehicles have been valued for years for their efficiency, sustainability and innovation. However, owning the ‘it’ car often eluded consumers who desired a great EV alongside all the other comforts of modern living. Kandi is changing that by revolutionizing the EV-buying experience for many,” said Johnny Tai, CEO of Kandi America. “Kandi’s mission is to make electric cars accessible to all. With these first two models, we are starting an Auto EVolution that will enable anyone, regardless of their financial status, to afford a reliable, high-tech EV.”

Xiaoming Hu, Chairman of Kandi Technologies, added, “We are excited to see this culmination of years of effort, the introduction of new, exciting Kandi EVs into the US market. Other EV peers have mainly served the high end of the market, while Kandi has always had a vision to bring the benefits of EVs to the mass market. We think our new K23 and K27 models will open a new world of modern transportation to the vast U.S. middle class, for whom EV choices have been scarce. We look forward to welcoming new buyers to the Kandi customer family.”

The virtual launch will take place at 10 a.m. CST on August 18. Participants will engage in a meaningful experience hosted by a surprise emcee, including an exclusive look at the sleek design and advanced technology features of models K27 and K23.

By Rotimi Ojomoyela, Ado-Ekiti,

In a bid to address housing shortages in Ekiti State, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), in partnership with the state government, is to build 50,000 low-cost housing units in the state.

The policy, which has been endorsed by Governor Kayode Fayemi will span a decade in Ekiti with UNOPS being the sole financier of the mortgage arrangement.

A statement by the Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Executive of UNOPS Mr. Vitaly Vanshelboim, on Wednesday, said the policy was part of the UNOPS Sustainable Infrastructure Impact Investments (S3I) initiative to easing difficulty in housing ownership.

He said the agreement if implemented will help address housing shortages in Ekiti State, with a focus on sustainability and local economic development.

“We are very pleased to support this contribution to Nigeria’s national development priorities and in particular, to help meet the critical need for affordable housing, through innovative approaches to construction and mortgage financing.

“UNOPS is strongly committed to helping find new ways to finance inclusive, resilient and sustainable development activities that generate positive social, economic, and environmental impacts,” added Vanshelboim.

Vanshelboim added that UNOPS will seek to mobilize resources from third-party investors to fund the initiative, which has an estimated gross development value, based on the sales value of completed homes of up to $2 billion.

“UNOPS and SHS will seek to mobilize resources from funding partners to support this initiative, which may eventually be worth up to $2 billion.

SHS will supply proprietary state-of-the-art technology to the project, as well as oversee the development of housing by qualified contractors.

“UNOPS will provide its comparative advantages in its mandated areas, such as infrastructure, procurement, and project management. The government of Ekiti State will identify and allocate suitable land for potential developments, and help to create an enabling environment for foreign direct investment and mortgage finance.

“Nigeria’s Ekiti State will join one of the largest affordable housing initiatives in the world, following a new agreement that will see at least 50,000 affordable homes built over the next decade”.

Fayemi, who applauded the initiative and the readiness of his government to back the policy, said: “This is how our promise of developing Ekiti and improving the lives of the people can be achieved. This partnership has come at an important time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reminded us of the need to deliver quality social infrastructure to the people.

“The affordable homes will feature renewable energy and disease preventative technology, including solar panel roofs, waste-to-energy technology and mosquito-repelling coatings. The initiative is expected to create thousands of local jobs and spur economic growth among a host of local industries”.

Nanaimo Mayor Leonard Krog said Monday the partnership “will have a significant impact on our substantial homeless population.”

article continues below

The city and the province have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop four supportive housing centres and three affordable housing projects.

It will take some time to get the buildings in place, Krog said.

The supportive housing projects, for those who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless, will replace the temporary modular housing at Labieux Road and Terminal Avenue.

Neighbours of the sites have complained of increasing crime since the sites opened in 2018, after the court ordered a tent city with about 300 campers shut down.

Krog said the new program “is the way to solve much of those concerns and resolve those problems.”

The modular housing will be removed from the Labieux site, while a new facility will be built on Terminal.

The plan is for B.C. Housing to pay construction costs, Nanaimo MLA Sheila Malcolmson said. That cost is not yet available.

Affordable housing tenants would have incomes that range from very low up to an annual income of $74,000 for a one-bedroom home, the province said.

Supportive housing buildings would be run under contract with a social agency, she said.

This housing program means “we will be making up a lot of lost ground,” Malcolmson said. “The visibility of homelessness has been stronger over the past few years and particularly the pandemic has revealed who was living close to homelessness and couldn’t couch surf any more through the pandemic.”

A 2018 count found that 23 per cent of the city’s 68,000 renters saw themselves as being at risk of homelessness. It also found 301 people who were homeless, although some believe the actual number is higher.

Those who have been living without homes for some time will be able to move into supportive housing where they can stabilize their health, work on underlying issues, learn about how be good tenants, and can move onto affordable housing.

New permanent supportive housing projects will be vastly different from the temporary units quickly set up when there was little time to get facilities in place as the tent city was being dismantled, Malcolmson said. These will be purpose-built facilities designed to operate in way that will minimize impacts on neighbours.

Community consultation is set to begin this summer.

Chrissy Forsythe, who has a business in Nanaimo, is advocating for a treatment-first remedy.

Rather than housing, the goal should be development of a new treatment centre, able to take in people needing help immediately, she said.

Forsythe said that every morning at 6:45 a.m., a number of government services clean up a temporary campsite near her Wesley Street building.

On Monday morning, she provided a naloxone kit — used to reverse an opioid overdose — to two men and then later checked to make sure they were all right. She woke one man up to make sure he was still alive. That sort of thing is common for her now.

“I want to see these people get help.”

Apart from general health cover policies that already cover the pandemic treatment costs, a first of its kind standard Corona insurance product, Corona Kavach, will be available in the next couple of days.

Following a mandate from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), all general insurers and standalone health insurance players have to offer this indemnity product compulsorily by July 10.

According to sources, the regulator has already received many product filings from insurers and is ‘busy’ scrutinising them.

The insurers are expecting a better response to Corona Kavach. ‘‘It’s a very good product which is beautifully designed to cover all specific aspects associated with Covid-19 such as testing and home treatment costs which help customers,’’ Bhaskar Nerurkar, Head, Claims, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, told BusinessLine.

The indicative list of treatment costs brought out by the General Insurance Council (GIC) is also expected to have a positive impact on all corona-related claims.

According to M N Sarma, Secretary-General, GIC, Covid-19 hospitalisation rates have been arrived at by the Council after taking into account the rates fixed by different State governments and after consultations with doctors.

Atul Sahai, CMD, New India Assurance and Chairman, GIC, said the general rates are high and the new rates would be about one-fourth of that.

The move helps all stakeholders. ``Now, the insurer will know how he has to pay to the hospital while a policyholder will have clarity on how much he will get from the insurer,’’ Nerurkar said.

Insurers feel that the new Covid rates would also benefit smaller, private sector insurance companies who may not have tie-ups with a large network of hospitals. Significantly, PPE as well as Covid testing are included.","With growing concerns over the unabated rise in Covid-19 cases, insurance options are also getting more broad-based and well defined.

(Bloomberg) -- Market contagion surrounding China Huarong Asset Management Co. is fading less than six weeks after credit investors reeled at the prospect of a default by one of the country’s most important state-owned companies.But while the tentative recovery is good news for Beijing’s attempts to instill more credit-market discipline without triggering a financial crisis, it could be a bad omen for any China Huarong bondholders still counting on a government bailout to make them whole.Spreads on investment-grade dollar bonds have tightened after hitting a nine-month high at the height of the panic, and yields on offshore junk notes are lower than at the end of March, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Tencent Holdings Ltd. recently secured $4.15 billion in one of Asia’s biggest dollar bond deals of the year, while Bank of China Ltd. units raised the equivalent of $2.35 billion in a multi-currency bond sale. At least ten Chinese borrowers were marketing or have sold dollar bonds this week, leaving the period set to be one of the busiest this year.The same is true of other indicators of stress in China’s financial system. While rising corporate defaults spilled over to the country’s money markets in November, there are no such signs of concern now. Banks are having no trouble borrowing from each other, judging by the declining cost of one-year interbank debt. The overnight repo rate fell below 1.5% last week for the first time in two months.Some market watchers say the relative calm could embolden Beijing to impose losses on China Huarong’s creditors.“Markets are getting a signal as loud and clear as one blasted from loudspeakers: China’s policy stance of ‘no debt guarantees’ has been extended beyond local government SOEs to large, national-level SOEs,” DBS strategists led by Taimur Baig wrote in a May 3 note. “Markets should know that these are not mere platitudes, if Huarong serves as an example.”Reducing moral hazard has become a priority for President Xi Jinping as he seeks to make the nation’s state-owned companies more efficient and better run. Ensuring the equity and bond markets reward and punish firms for their corporate behavior, rather than relying on the cumbersome state system, is a relatively new approach. There are signs it is working. SOEs have replaced their private counterparts as the country’s biggest source of defaults.Allowing a debt restructuring at China Huarong, one of the country’s biggest financial conglomerates, would send a strong signal of the government’s resolve. The company’s dollar bonds due 2025 traded at well above par at the end of March, despite the trial and swift execution of its chairman Lai Xiaomin in January for bribery. They’re now priced at about 80 cents on the dollar. Recent high profile defaults by two university-linked companies, Peking University Founder Group Corp. and Tsinghua Unigroup Co., have served as additional warnings to investors dabbling in borrowers with ambiguous ties to the state.Even after the rout in China Huarong’s bonds, some investors are still betting Beijing will stand behind the company. It has so far met all of its debt obligations on time and has said it is operating normally with sufficient liquidity. A China Huarong vice president recently said downgrades by international rating agencies “have no factual basis” and are “too pessimistic.” The comments, which were carried in the state-run Shanghai Securities News, were viewed by some observers as a signal of continued state support.The nation’s banking and insurance regulator has also said China Huarong has ample liquidity, though it has yet to provide clarity about the company’s future or what penalty bondholders might pay, if any, to help fix its debt issues.Curtailing implicit guarantees won’t be easy for China, given that they also backstop the nation’s stocks and currency. But there are signs of a broad shift. The “national team” of state-backed funds has become less influential in the equity market, while China allowed the yuan to weaken past the key support level of 7 per dollar in 2019 for the first time in more than a decade.Of course, there’s no guarantee that credit markets would remain calm if China Huarong announced a restructuring or default. Given the firm’s sprawling and complex business, investors have little clarity over how such an event might ripple through China’s $54 trillion financial system. And because China Huarong hasn’t released its 2020 financial results, the state of its balance sheet remains a mystery.Still, the fact that signs of a broader credit-market panic have subsided without major intervention from Beijing are likely to be of comfort to officials seeking to tackle China’s moral hazard problem.“It is a success as good as can be for policymakers, without using a heavy-handed approach,” wrote the DBS strategists.(Updates third paragraph with details on Chinese borrowers selling bonds.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","While rising corporate defaults spilled over to the country’s money markets in November, there are no such signs of concern now.

Frozen foods have gotten a bad rap over the years. In the past, freezer finds were notoriously high in sodium and preservatives while not providing much in the nutrition department; however, the tides have certainly turned.As long as the food you're stocking in your freezer isn't loaded with salt, sugar, or other unsavory ingredients, frozen food can be just as nutritious as fresh, making it a convenient and affordable option for adding fruits, veggies, and whole grains to your diet. And that's not the only benefit: keeping frozen food in your home can be a lifesaver on busy weeks when you can't make it to the grocery store or you need dinner on the table STAT. (Related: The Best Frozen Foods To Stock In Your Freezer, Say Dietitians.) (Related: 100 Unhealthiest Foods on the Planet.)While there is no shortage of good-for-you options that you can pack in your freezer—fruits, veggies, and seafood, to name a few—there is one frozen food item that takes the cake.As a registered dietitian, working mom, and the overall busy lady who likes to eat well but hates to spend too much time in the kitchen, the #1 best-frozen food to keep on hand is a pre-cooked bag of frozen grains.Why frozen grains are the #1 best frozen food to buyOn busy days, many of us (present company included) tend to think about which protein we are going to eat for dinner. When the kids ask ""what's for dinner,"" the response is oftentimes ""chicken"" or ""fish""—we rarely concern ourselves with what makes up the rest of the plate.But to eat healthily, you need to think beyond animal meat. Well-balanced meals should contain a healthy portion of protein along with healthy carbs and fiber-rich legumes and veggies. While dinner rolls are an easy go-to filler carb, they aren't the most nutritious option; however, finding a good-for-you carb in a pinch can sometimes be easier said than done.And that is where frozen cooked grains can come to the rescue.Why cooked grains are a healthy addition to a mealYes, refined carbs like mashed potatoes and white rice can be absolutely satisfying. But choosing carbs that are not whole grain can leave you with some nutrition gaps.On the other hand, whole grains—think quinoa, sorghum, and brown rice—still have the grain's natural bran and endosperm of the grain; therefore, these grains contain nutrients like fiber, polyphenols, and minerals that refined options may not offer.In addition to nourishing your body with essential micronutrients, fiber, and a solid dose of plant-based protein, frozen grains give some staying power to your meals. Plus, whole grains provide countless health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, and even early death, and have also been linked to people experiencing less belly fat.How frozen pre-cooked grains can save the dayAlthough cooking whole grains is as simple as boiling water and letting the grain simmer, on busy nights, some of us simply don't have the time available to wait for water to boil or to keep a watchful eye on the pot to make sure it doesn't boil over. (And don't get us started on adding yet another pot to the pile of dishes we'll need to clean.)That's where frozen grains come in.Whole grains freeze very well, helping you get dinner on the table faster. You can either buy a bag from the grocery store, or DIY with leftovers: If you happen to make a large batch of quinoa one evening, once it is cooled, simply add some to a zip-top bag and place it in the freezer. Then, on busy evenings, turn to your trusty microwave to bring it back to life.Alternatively, keeping a bag of pre-cooked and pre-seasoned grain, like Path of Life Southwest Mango Quinoa Blend can help elevate a basic dinner in a nutritious and delicious way. With frozen pre-cooked organic quinoa, black beans, mango, tomato, corn, olive oil, lime, peppers, and cilantro, this bag of goodness helps make like so much easier.The main ingredient in this dish is quinoa—a gluten-free whole grain that is chock-full of antioxidants, fiber, and a slew of vitamins and minerals. And while plain old quinoa may be a bit bland, Path Of Life takes this side up a notch by mixing this grain with nourishing and tasty ingredients like tomatoes, lime juice, and peppers. Plus, the chunks of real mango give this side a unique flavor that can compensate for more simply-seasoned proteins.Ways to eat frozen grainsFrozen quinoa can be used as a side dish for foods like fish, chicken, and beef. It can also be a stand-in for plant-based dishes like quinoa tacos and quinoa stuffed peppers.So, among the sea of options in the frozen food section of the grocery store, frozen pre-cooked grains (like cooked quinoa or brown rice) or a pre-made version like Path of Life Southwest Mango Quinoa Blend is the way to go. It is flavorful, made with natural ingredients, and enjoying it doesn't mean I have to mess up my kitchen to make it. Certainly, a product that checks all of this dietitian's boxes.

Bproperty's trend analysis shows impact of coronavirus pandemic on rental properties

A trend analysis brought up by leading property solutions provider Bproperty which shows most people of the capital preferring smaller and more affordable houses amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

The research data of the analysis was collected via the number of users, listings added and queries made at bproperty.com over the past six months, from January to June, said a press release.

Since March, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, most people have been looking for 2-bedroom apartments with the most preferred size being homes that are between 1,000 and 1,500 sq ft.

According to the data, the average rent people are mostly searching for is between Tk10,000 and Tk20,000.

The first quarter had been great for rental properties with rental listing growth increasing by about 20% from the last quarter of 2019, the trend analysis showed.

However, the rate of rental property listing started to dip during the end of March when the countrywide shutdown was first officially announced.

This was partly because the situation regarding coronavirus was new for everyone and most people were not sure what to expect next and thus regular activities had slowed down.

The demand for rental properties began to increase again starting in May but it was during June when Bproperty website traffic received a lot of hits on rental properties.

As per the data, many people are looking to rent at the moment and the overall queries for rent is higher than the early part of the year.

Bproperty’s analysis also revealed that in 2020, some of the areas with the lowest average rent include Shyampur (Tk8,086), Khilkhet (Tk11,386), Maniknagar (Tk12,427), Kafrul (Tk14,864), Dakshin Khan (Tk15,233), Agargaon (Tk15,829) and Hazaribag (Tk15,918.)

Despite the growing demand for these areas, Uttara, Bashundhara R/A and Mohammadpur still remain the most demanded areas for rent, according to Bproperty.

These areas made up about 35% of the total demand for 2020.

Mark Nosworthy, CEO of Bproperty, said: ”Given the current situation, it is understandable why there has been so much movement in the rental scene. Many people are having difficulty meeting their living expenses, which would explain why they would prefer to move and rent some place less expensive. We understand people’s demand, which is why we are very much determined to helping out everyone finding their desired homes to rent.”","Since March, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, most people have been looking for 2-bedroom apartments with the most preferred size being homes that are between 1,000 and 1,500 sq ft.

Design

The Linearflux HyperSonic TWS are most certainly designed for those who like a sporty aesthetic. Everything from the packaging to the Qi-enabled charging case has that sports “look” to it. It sort of reminds me of the old Sony Sports Walkman I used to have back in the late ’80s.

The charging case is about the same size as most of the competition but is actually lighter than others I’ve used. The top of the case is branded with the Linearflux logo and the USB-C port is on the back. Opening the case reveals a bright neon interior emblazoned with the Linearflux HyperSonic TWS branding. The same sort of color scheme flows into the earbuds themselves. The case clicks closed very nicely and the magnets hold the buds in firmly.

The earbuds themselves are average-sized and comparable to other brands. The outside of the buds has more branding on them, which actually looks pretty nice and goes with the sport aesthetic the company is shooting for. The color scheme is the same black and neon yellow on the earbuds.

Linearflux claims the HyperSonic earbuds have passive noise canceling. This can be said for most earbuds, but I did find these to fit really really well in the ear and they produce a very nice seal. This seal helps with the passive noise canceling and isolates the listener from the world outside of the music.

As I said, the fit on these is great. These babies sit right inside the ear so well and so tight they really help enhance the sound, and they won’t fall out. I’d say pretty great for exercise use, not to mention they are IPX7 waterproof rated so should do well with sweat too.

Save Paired well with the LG Velvet.

There are touch controls on both earbuds, and here’s what they do:

Left or Right: 1-click: Play/Pause 2-clicks: Track Forward 3-clicks: Track Reverse Press and Hold 1-sec: Siri or Google Assistant 1-click: Answer an incoming call 2-clicks: Hang up a call Press and Hold 10-sec+: Master Reset



The one thing I couldn’t figure out was charging. I mean, plugging the case in or using wireless charging wasn’t a problem. The issue was knowing if they were charging at all. There is an LED on the front but it never seemed to be on when charging. It blinks when you put the buds in but doesn’t stay on when charging or blink red or orange or any color at all (although the instructions say it should do so). So I just never knew when they were done charging. There is an LED on each bud and when you put them in, they do light up, but that doesn’t tell me much. I plugged them in overnight to be sure they were charged 100%.

Overall, the design of the Linearflux HyperSonic TWS earbuds are designed well. The company really hit their goal of the sport look. I love the fit and noise isolation they provide. I do wish there was an LED charging indicator.

Ease Of Use

The Linearflux HyperSonic TWS are super easy to use. Just pop them into the charging case, charge them up to full, remove them and put them in. They will pair to each other and then go into pairing mode. Just find them in your device’s Bluetooth settings and you’re set. Overall, just as easy to use as any other Bluetooth earbuds.

Save The sound favors the bottom end.

Sound

The best way to describe the sound of the Linearflux HyperSonic TWS is bass friendly. While these don’t overpower the mids and highs, they are tuned even more to the bass side than I normally like. This isn’t a ding towards them as I know there are plenty of people who enjoy this sort of soundstage.

The mids and highs are pretty well balanced, and that extra bass adds a thick bottom end. The really excellent noise isolation makes the whole soundstage that much beefier and full. As I already mentioned, I am a really big fan of the fit and the noise isolation these offer.

Overall, the sound is thick, a bit thicker than I prefer, but for many, this is going to hit the sweet spot.

Reception/Call Quality

Bluetooth reception is good, just as good as any other Bluetooth device. Call quality was decent on my end, but the people I called said I sounded tinny and that the background was amplified. I don’t use earbuds for phone calls so this is irrelevant to my use case, but for those who need them for phone calls, these may not be for you.

Battery Life

Battery life is outstanding with a total of 20-hours, give or take, depending on your use case. I got about 7-hours on one charge and then there are the extra charges in the case. You can also bump charge the Linearflux HyperSonic TWS with an hour of charge time with only 5-minutes of charging. Overall, these are great on battery life and most should be happy with them.

Save Priced competitively at US$99.98.

Price/Value

The Linearflux HyperSonic TWS are priced at US$99.98. This isn’t the cheapest set of TWS earbuds on the market but they stand head-to-head with the competition. I think the value for what you get is here, but I think these would fly off the shelves if they priced them at US$79.98 instead. But this price point is competitive.

Wrap Up

Overall, these are competitive earbuds. They have an IPX7 waterproof rating, great battery life, good noise isolation, good sound, and a competitive match. The Linearflux HyperSonic TWS are built for those who are into the sports lifestyle. These should keep up with those who are active and are looking for a healthy dose of features from their earbuds.

Graduate student Jackie Dowling, who works in the lab of Nathan Lewis (BS '77), the George L. Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry, has collaborated with Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution for Science and others to examine energy-storage options and multiple decades of data about wind and solar availability. Dowling and her collaborators determined that currently available battery technology is prohibitively expensive for long-term energy storage services for the power grid and that alternative technologies that can store a few weeks' to a month's worth of energy for entire seasons or even multiple years may be the key to building affordable, reliable renewable electricity systems.

Energy storage is needed with renewable energy because wind and solar energy are not as reliably available as fossil fuels. For example, wind power is often at its lowest during the summer in the United States, which is when the electrical grid is strained the most by the demand for air conditioning in homes and businesses.

""This research is motivated by the fact that laws in several states have mandated 100 percent carbon-free electricity systems by midcentury,"" says Dowling, lead author of a paper about the work. ""Within these mandates, a lot of states include requirements for wind and solar power. Both wind and solar are variable from day to day, or even year to year, yet high reliability is mandatory for a viable electricity system. Energy storage can fill in for the gaps between supply and demand.""

Dowling looked at short-duration storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries, and long-duration storage methods, such as hydrogen storage, compressed-air storage, and pumped-storage hydroelectricity.

To see how to optimize the use of those storage technologies at the lowest energy cost, Dowling built a mathematical simulation of each and incorporated historical electricity-demand data and four decades of hourly resolved historical weather data across the contiguous U.S. The Macro Energy Model, as she calls it, reveals that adding long-duration storage to a wind-solar-battery system lowers energy costs. In contrast, using batteries alone for storage makes renewable energy more expensive.

Dowling says that the extra expense associated with batteries occurs because they cannot cost-effectively store enough energy for an entire season during which electricity is generated in lower amounts. That means an electrical grid would require many costlier solar panels or wind turbines to compensate and would result in wasteful idling of electricity-generation equipment for much of the year.

Currently available battery technology is not even close to being cost effective for seasonal storage, Dowling says.

""The huge dip in wind power in the summer in the U.S. is problematic, and batteries are not suitable for filling that gap. So, if you only have batteries, you have to overbuild wind or solar capacity,"" she says. ""Long-duration storage helps avoid the need to overbuild power generation infrastructure and provides electricity when people need it rather than only when nature provides it. At current technology costs, storage in underground caverns of green hydrogen generated by water electrolysis would provide a cost-effective approach for long-duration grid storage.""

Other researchers have built renewable energy models, but the team's data-driven approach is the first to incorporate four decades of historical wind and solar variability data, thus factoring in variability from year to year and periodic episodes of rare weather events that affect power generation, such as wind and solar droughts.

""The more years of data we use in our models, the more we find a compelling need for long-term storage to get the reliability that we expect from an electricity system,"" she says.

Dowling suggests her findings may be helpful to policy makers in states with 100 percent carbon-free electricity laws and high wind/solar mandates and to other U.S. states considering the adoption of similar laws. In the future, she plans to extend her research to take an in-depth look at the roles that specific types of energy storage, such as hydrogen or redox flow batteries, can play in renewable energy systems. For instance, some types of batteries might effectively serve as medium-duration energy storage, she says.","Energy storage is needed with renewable energy because wind and solar energy are not as reliably available as fossil fuels.

“Access to affordable and clean energy is important to fight poverty, create jobs and empower women and girls. The European Investment Bank is pleased to agree new support for scaling up off-grid solar deployment in East Africa under this new partnership with ENGIE. Over a million people across Uganda will be able to access electricity for the first time that will power communications, provide light and make cooking easier. This scheme will also reduce use of kerosene, charcoal and candles to help families save money, reduce pollution and reduce the risk of accidents. Unlocking sustainable economic and social development through off-grid solar is key for Africa’s future and the EIB is pleased to back this project in Uganda,” said Ambroise Fayolle, Vice President, European Investment Bank.

Yoven Moorooven, CEO, ENGIE Africa, added that: “At ENGIE, we see the massive potential of the off-grid electrification sector as a way to bridge energy gaps across Africa, faster and more affordably. Every day families across Africa are able to access electricity for the first time using off-grid solar technology provided by ENGIE Africa. Our new partnership with the European Investment Bank in Uganda will allow Fenix to provide ultra-affordable PAYGO systems to millions of people in villages across the country. This will provide access to clean solar power and financial empowerment.”

Moorooven explained that providing access to energy in Africa is a huge undertaking but the company firmly believes that universal access to energy is achievable in the foreseeable future, through smart investments in a combination of national grid extension, solar home systems and mini-grids.

“With our off-grid platform, we are industrialising and scaling up the development of a wide range of decentralised solutions, with a sustainable business model. As of now, ENGIE is providing decentralised electricity to more than 4.5 million people in nine countries through solar home systems from both Fenix and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as mini-grids from ENGIE PowerCorner.”.

The EIB has agreed to provide a US$ 12.5 million loan to support the deployment of 240,000 high-quality solar home systems in Uganda by Fenix International, a subsidiary of ENGIE.

Solving the last mile challenge across Uganda

Only one in five Ugandans living in remote and rural communities has access to reliable electricity. By scaling up adoption of off-grid solar technology this new initiative will provide economic, social, education and health opportunities for families and entrepreneurs who cannot be connected to the national electricity network.

Customers will also be able to benefit from Fenix International’s service centres that provide support in 30 languages across Uganda.

Supporting private sector growth and sustainable development in Uganda

Following the new agreement between Fenix and the European Investment Bank households, entrepreneurs and small holders across Uganda will be able to access electricity for mobile phones, solar lighting, refrigeration, radio and television. This will help farmers to sell produce, create new markets for traders and improve health.

Increased provision of reliable and affordable energy will create new opportunities for women and girls and reduce exposure to indoor pollution from current kerosene use.

“The European Union is committed to supporting sustainable economic and social development across Uganda. This new co-operation initiative between the European Investment Bank and Fenix International, a subsidiary of leading European energy company ENGIE, demonstrates the value-added of European engagement with Ugandan partners to advance the country’s development vision. Harnessing renewable energy through innovative off-grid solar technology, combined with productive uses of power in rural areas, is a direct demonstration of the European Union’s green deal for Africa, providing new opportunities for millions of Ugandans,” said Attilio Pacifici, European Union Ambassador to Uganda.

Unlocking financial empowerment

Provision of a PAYGO model will allow families who would be unable to afford the upfront costs of solar home systems to repay the cost of equipment over years at less than USD 20 cents a day. The new European Investment Bank financing will also allow repayment of equipment purchased in US dollars in Ugandan shillings. Previously currency fluctuations hindered provision of affordable clean energy solutions to Ugandans without access to foreign currency.

“Providing hundreds of thousands of new solar home systems through the PAYGO model will allow our Ugandan team to transform communities across the country. We are proud to be the latest national off-grid power operation to be supported by the European Investment Bank and we will work tirelessly to illuminate homes and provide clean power until all of Uganda can access electricity.” said Daniel Willette, Managing Director, Fenix International Uganda.

Customers will also benefit from cheaper costs and easier repayment through use of mobile banking. This will also provide other financial products and allow customers to expand existing equipment as needed.

Building on the EIB’s renewable energy track record in Uganda and across Africa

Over the last decade the European Investment Bank has provided more than 5.4 billion euros for clean energy investment across Africa.

In recent years the European Investment Bank has been a leading financial for the Bujagali hydropower project in Uganda, the Lake Turkana Wind Farm, Olkaria Geothermal plant and the Radiant and Eldosol solar schemes, as well as financing last mile connections in Kenya. The EIB is also supporting studies to harness hydropower to transform clean energy in Burundi and the Great Lakes region.

ENGIE is the largest independent electricity producer in the world, and one of the major players in natural gas and energy services. The Group has more than 50 years of experience on the African continent and has the unique ability to implement integrated solutions all along the energy value chain, from centralised electricity production to off-grid solutions (solar home systems, mini-grids) and energy services. ENGIE Africa employs nearly 4,000 people, and has 3.15 GW of power generation capacity in operation or construction. It is a leader in the decentralised energy market, providing clean energy to more than 4.5 million people through domestic solar installations and local microgrids.

During the industry’s boom in Europe and the world, investment in the sector in Serbia has been weak. ProCredit Bank’s expert Danko Kalkan points to great growth potential.

Prices of solar power equipment have been halved in the past several years so such systems are more profitable for investors in Europe and beyond than power plants that use conventional sources, as firms are burdened with expenses for carbon dioxide emissions and higher environmental protection standards.

Incentives for prosumers

The production of power from the Sun’s energy is rapidly expanding on the global level. Clean solutions like PV have wide applications and they have become more affordable also for smaller firms, agricultural producers and natural persons.

Many states, like Romania and Italy, offer incentives for the construction of rooftop solar units, and the idea is also for surplus output to be delivered to the grid and compensated, so consumers turn prosumers.

One of the most important factors for enterprises and retail consumers is more independence, so outages have little or no impact. The independence effect can be enhanced with energy storage – batteries.

Consumers who install solar panels increase the level of their energy independence

Until recently, solar energy’s presence in Serbia was negligible both in companies and in households. However, with the development of financing models, a wider selection of technologies in the market and the expansion of installers’ capacity, it is now possible to generate power for own needs in Serbia as well.

Economic case for firms, individuals

Six years ago, investment costs per watt of photovoltaics were EUR 1.2, and the benchmark already fell to between EUR 0.6 and EUR 0.7 now, making the technology economically viable, said Danko Kalkan, Green Finance and Environmental Management Unit Coordinator in ‎ProCredit Bank in Serbia. He told Balkan Green Energy News solar power has great growth potential in the country both for firms and individuals.

Kalkan noted annual solar radiation in Serbia is 1.4 MWh per square meter or 40% higher than in Germany, which has the biggest installed capacity in Europe.

ProCredit Bank insists clean energy is no luxury anymore and that it must become part of everyday life. It declared a goal to become climate neutral by 2023.

ProCredit tapping on solar power potential

Late last year, the German-based financial institution installed a solar power unit of 40 kW on the roof of its headquarters in Belgrade. The bank says the facility, built for its own electricity consumption, enables partial energy independence and contributes to environmental protection.

The new photovoltaic panels have a projected output of 41.6 MWh per year. “It is equivalent to the consumption of 11 households. Furthermore, annual greenhouse gas emissions will be lowered by 31.5 tons,” Kalkan said and added the bank would continue to install small solar power plants on its buildings. ProCredit is also implementing measures to decrease electricity consumption.

The bank’s rooftop solar system output is equivalent to the consumption of eleven domestic homes

It also introduced interest-free loans in Serbia for the installation of solar panels for five to seven years, in cooperation with engineering firms. Individuals can obtain financing for rooftop systems of up to 5 kW without a down payment and the minimum investment is EUR 6,000.

All companies and agricultural producers can opt for photovoltaic facilities with a capacity of up to 120 kW, starting at EUR 108,000, and savings can be bigger than monthly instalments, the bank said. All versions include installation and maintenance. A special offer is for trailers that would be equipped with solar systems of 4.5 kW or 7.5 kW.","Solar power systems are getting cheaper every year.

Lamont promised to generate all of Connecticut's power from renewable sources of energy by 2040. One may debate whether this goal is achievable, but one stark fact is clear – if we are to rely on electricity, rather than fossil fuels, to power our economy, we need power that is affordable for businesses and ratepayers and an electrical grid that is resilient, reliable and robust. Based on Eversource's recent performance, we are in big trouble.

Just over two weeks ago, Eversource customers opened their electricity bills and made an alarming discovery; their bills had soared. PURA, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that oversees our deregulated utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, had recently approved a rate increase to take effect July 1. Faced with customer outrage, Eversource at first attempted to blame the increase on the historic power purchase agreement championed by Governor Lamont, between Eversource and UI and Dominion Energy, to purchase power from Dominion Energy's two Millstone nuclear power plants. The deal preserved this resource, which supplies half of Connecticut's electricity and 90% of its carbon-free power, along with the 1,500 jobs and its $1.6 billion annual contribution to the Connecticut economy. The purchase price, guaranteed for 10 years at 4.99 cents per kilowatt-hour, is the lowest carbon free price in Connecticut and 32% lower than Eversource's standard offer rate, and guaranteed Connecticut's clean energy future.

It soon became clear that this attempt to pass the price increase buck had no basis in fact. Eversource's own filing with the Public Utility Regulatory Authority states: ""As reflected in this filing and the attached exhibits, the impact of the July 1st rate change for a typical residential (Rate 1) Standard Service customer using 700 kWh per month will be a rate increase of 3.5 % or $5.58 per month."" Indeed, United Illuminating, the state's other power distributor, which serves 335,000 customers, also sells electricity from the New England grid supplied by Millstone and other generators. A spokesman reported ""no big changes"" to rates in July due to Millstone.""

In response to the outcry about the Eversource price hike, I, along with many other legislators on both sides of the aisle, called for an immediate suspension of the rate increases and a hearing to investigate the basis for those increases. Fortunately, PURA has both suspended the increase and opened an official docket. I commend the authority for its decision and look forward to submitting questions and hearing Eversource's explanation and answers.

However, ratepayers' unhappiness with Eversource is no longer confined to the recent rate increases. Hundreds of thousands of Connecticut residents were left without power following storm Isaias; both Eversource and United Illuminating are being faulted for their inadequate response to the storm. I echo Governor Lamont's call for PURA to conduct a thorough investigation of the state's public utility companies. As I write this, Eversource was predicting full restoration would not come until Tuesday, more than a week after the storm.

Eversource stated on the company's earnings call with analysts 10 days ago that the bulk of their profits going forward would be driven by transmission and distribution charges. If that is indeed the case, it is even more vital that the rationale behind the increased charges be examined in depth and that the company actually distribute and transmit electricity to their customers reliably!

Post Super Storm Sandy, the Connecticut legislature passed a number of measures to prevent the kind of prolonged and catastrophic power loss that resulted from that and prior storms. It is time to revisit that legislation to ensure its requirements were implemented and are currently being followed. If not, what should be done to address this? On a national level, as the country looks at infrastructure investment, grid modernization and hardening must be a top priority. In a world that relies increasingly on electricity, our power supply must be reliable, resilient and above all, affordable.

Connecticut residents pay the highest electricity prices in the continental United States. Surely they deserve better than this.

Cooper, regional manager of Marcus & Millichap’s Denver office. Together, Centennial Village in Evans, the Camelot Apartments in Greeley, and the Villa 14 Apartments, also in Evans, total 104 units.

This was the buyer’s first affordable transaction and represents a long-term play. According to Beverly, the deal demonstrates increasing interest in affordable deals among market rate investors. “Affordable deals offer a safe harbor for investors who think the current cycle is long-in-the-tooth or who feel uncertain about pandemic conditions,” he said.

Centennial Village, an elderly-designated, nine building, 48-unit apartment community, is located in Evans, Colorado. The property, built in 1982, was developed utilizing HUD 221(d)(4) financing. The property’s mark-to-market use agreement extends through November of 2031. The property sold for $3,850,000.

Villa 14 Apartments is also an elderly-designated apartment community, consisting of four buildings and 36 units, located in Evans. The property, built in 1982, was developed utilizing HUD 221(d)(4) financing. The property’s mark-to-market use agreement extends through November of 2033. The property sold for $2,550,000.

The Camelot Apartments is a 20-unit apartment community located in central Greeley. This property underwent a $500,000 renovation at the end of 2019 and recently received its RAD-2 conversion. The property sold for $2,250,000.

This portfolio allowed the buyer to establish a large footprint in the Greeley metro area while utilizing financing to maximize the spread between interest and capitalization rates. In addition to strong HAP and LURA contracts, minimal turnover rates and a two-year waiting list for new tenants made this a safe asset. This sizable portfolio provided the buyer with a unique opportunity, combining value with little need for asset improvements.

Phillip Gause, first vice president capital markets in the firm’s Denver office, secured the financing for the portfolio. Interest rates were 2.98 percent, 3.08 percent, and 3.12 percent for Centennial Village, Villa 14, and the Camelot Apartments, respectively.

“We were very pleased to have assisted the Sponsor in this transaction by arranging very competitively priced, long term fixed rate non-recourse portfolio financing on his behalf. As evidenced by the terms of the financing the overall environment for permanent debt secured by deed restricted affordable housing continues to be very competitive despite the dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Gause commented. “While there were certainly some challenges posed by issues related to the pandemic, we were also able to take advantage of the declining interest rate environment and close at rates roughly 100 basis points lower than those quoted at application. Our strong relationship with the lender also helped us work through a fairly complex and challenging set of regulatory, legal, and underwriting hurdles to get this transaction across the finish line.”","Three affordable housing apartment communities in Northern Colorado have sold for $8,650,000, according to Skyler G.

Preserve at Peachtree Shoals is located at 2995 Old Peachtree Road in Dacula, Georgia. This new development will consist of 240 apartment units for seniors 55 and older and will have an affordable rent structure for households earning 30 to 80 percent of the area median income (AMI). The development comprised of one, two and three-bedroom units, is expected to be available to rent in the first quarter of 2022. To complete the project, MPC partnered with Dominium, the nation’s fourth-largest provider of affordable housing, and Searles Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides gracious living services to elderly and disabled residents.

“Preserve at Peachtree Shoals will be an excellent and much-needed addition to the Dacula area. It will provide seniors with beautiful housing that is affordable,” said Mark Sween, Vice President & Project Partner of Dominium. “We are excited to begin construction and to work again with our state housing tax credit partner, Monarch Private Capital.”

Dacula, Georgia is part of Gwinnett County, which has been a titan of social and economic progress for decades. Dacula has its own unique factors, however, that make it a great candidate for revitalization. Dacula is at the center of Georgia’s Innovation Crescent. Covering nearly 40 percent of Georgia’s population, the Innovation Crescent is the state’s hub for life sciences but is quickly becoming that of the entire Southeast. The crescent includes top research organizations such as Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Georgia, the CDC, Georgia Gwinnett College and Gwinnett Tech. In addition, the hub hosts a wide range of scientific companies, large and small, bringing in a variety of people and revenue to the community.

“This new affordable senior living development will help strengthen the Dacula area by providing residents with quality homes, enriching programs and services, and greater access to the unique variety of resources located throughout the city,” said David Searles Jr., CFO of the Searles Foundation. “We recognize the importance of the happiness and well-being of our senior residents and stay committed to fostering a friendly and valuable community for all.”

The development of Preserve at Peachtree Shoals will not only address the need for affordable, senior living opportunities in the area, but it will also have a major positive impact on the local economy. In just the initial year, the project is expected to create over 300 direct and indirect jobs and generate over $20 million in local tax revenue. The project will continue to benefit the area in the years to follow, paving the way for a lively and prosperous community for all.

“By building clean, well-constructed apartment units in an area that lacks adequate senior living facilities, we will help accelerate the growth of the community while also filling a significant housing void,” said Steve LeClere, Director of LIHTC Development at MPC. “We appreciate our collaboration with Dominium, who’s leadership and expertise will help make this project a reality.”

Is there such a thing? Do they exist in the UK? DriveElectric has some answers.

Originally published on the DriveElectric website.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are often seen as being more expensive than petrol cars, but if the fuel saving costs are taken into account and the upfront purchase price is spread across monthly leasing payments, then a new EV could cost the equivalent of less than £200 per month.

If the UK is to meet its 2050 Net Zero target then all new cars on sale need to be EVs by 2035, or possibly earlier — to be confirmed following a government consultation which closed on 31 July. To ensure that the maximum number of motorists are able to make the switch to electric cars over the coming years, EVs need to be as affordable as possible. The following five electric cars are examples of vehicles that motorists can drive today — with zero tailpipe emissions and all the other benefits that electric cars offer, including being virtually silent, very refined and easy to drive.

Editor’s note: The calculations below don’t even take into account big tax savings available with electric vehicles in the UK, which make cheap electric vehicles even cheaper relatively speaking!

Estimated real-world electric driving range: 170 miles

Monthly lease cost: £338.30

Estimated fuel savings per month: £120

Cost per month after fuel savings deducted: £218.30

The monthly lease costs are for a 4-year Personal Contract Hire (PCH) covering 10,000 miles per year; they include VAT and there is no initial rental. Estimated fuel savings are based on 14p per kW electricity costs and monthly mileages covered as part of a 10,000 miles per year PCH.

Maintenance costs of EVs are also lower than those of petrol cars, and for company car drivers, EVs have zero Benefit in Kind tax for 2020/21.

Mike Potter, Managing Director of DriveElectric, comments: “There’s much talk about EVs reaching price parity with petrol cars over the coming years, but zero emission electric cars can be more affordable than people think today. Fuel costs of EVs are around 20% of the fuel costs of petrol cars, and spreading the cost of the initial purchase price over monthly leasing payments means that EVs are now typically cheaper than petrol cars from a whole-life cost point of view. This could enable large numbers of motorists to make the switch to EVs to help improve local air quality and achieve Net Zero.

“The driving ranges of the latest EVs are sufficient for many people’s regular driving patterns, and for those such as business users who regularly need to cover lots of motorway miles, there’s an ever-increasing variety of vehicle options available with electric driving ranges over 300 miles.”

DriveElectric is an electric vehicle leasing company that has been helping organisations and individuals to adopt EVs to save money, lower emissions and transition to low carbon energy since 2008. DriveElectric aims to make the switch to electric cars and vans simple for business fleets.

DriveElectric also offers a FlexiHire service which enables businesses to hire an electric car or van for a period of a few months rather than being committed to a lease over a number of years. As there’s also no upfront payment, the FlexiHire service provides a cost-effective way to drive an electric vehicle.

DriveElectric staff are currently working remotely from home and business operations are following COVID-19 government guidelines.

U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have been one reason for the deficit of heavy crude that gave refiners a headache and forced them to switch to high-sulfur fuel oil as an alternative feedstock, but the OPEC+ cuts also contributed to the shortage, Bloomberg writes in a report. As a result, these refiners had to switch to so-called dirty fuel oil, a byproduct of crude oil refining. Some refiners that are not equipped for handling the fuel oil had to shut down because the feedstock became too expensive.

This deficit occurred during a seasonal jump in consumption of the heavy oil derivative: in the Middle East, imports of high-sulfur fuel oil rise during the summer months because it is used for electricity generation and demand for electricity rises during the hottest season of the year. At the same time, India was buying more high-sulfur fuel oil, too, with imports from January to July three times higher than imports for the same period of last year.

Meanwhile, production of high-sulfur fuel oil has shrunk following the entry into effect of new emissions regulation from the International Maritime Organisation, which mandates that vessels either use fuel that contains no more than 0.5 percent of sulfur content or equip with a so-called sulfur scrubber.

As a result of this combination of trends, the deficit on the high-sulfur market reached half a million barrels daily last month, Bloomberg reports, citing figures from JBC Energy. Thanks to the relaxation of OPEC+ production cuts, this should ease to some 100,000 bpd by the end of the year.

Despite their razor-thin profile and delicate solution-based construction, the new solar cells returned to Earth intact while sending back all the juicy details about their performance in the up-above. Spoiler alert: on a gram-per-gram basis, perovskite comes out miles ahead of the competition.

Perovskite Solar Cells In Outer Space!

For those of you new to the topic, solar cells have been used in space operations since 1959, and space applications paved the way for the affordable, down-to-Earth versions that millions of electricity users enjoy today, mainly in the form of low cost silicon technology.

The perovskite version is a relatively new development, with research picking up mainly after 2006. Perovskite is much lighter than silicon, less expensive than other solar materials, and easier to convert into a functioning PV device, which means that the next generation of solar cells could be even more affordable than ever.

Perovskite solar cells are also lightweight and flexible. That provides them with opportunities for application on clothing, buildings, cars, and, of course, rockets, among other things.

All things being equal, the space-friendly performance of perovskite cells indicates that the new PV technology could find widespread application here on Earth, once all the kinks are worked out.

One of those kinks is durability. Early iterations of perovskite PV cells dissolved under ambient conditions. The space flight demonstrates how far the R&D has progressed since then.

Gram-For-Gram, Perovskite Solar Cells Put Out

Another one of those kinks is solar conversion efficiency. The latest perovskite solar cells are still less efficient than their silicon counterparts, but they have come a long way from the measly single-digit performance of early attempts.

As of 2020, new perovskite technology clocks in at an impressive 25% or more. Combined with low cost and other attributes, that puts perovskite in the running to compete in the commercial marketplace.

And, that could include the increasingly commercial environment of outer space.

Last year, a team of researchers from the Technical University of Munich partnered with the German Aerospace Center to send two batches of hybrid perovskite and organic solar cells 240 kilometers up into space. The results were just published last week in the journal Joule, and they are pretty spectacular.

You can get all the details from the study under the title, “Perovskite and Organic Solar Cells on a Rocket Flight.”

For those of you on the go, the key point is that the solar cells exceeded power densities between 7 and 14 mW cm−2 , which means that they outperformed the competition by a mile.

Stated another way, conventional solar cells used in space achieve about three watts per gram. The TUM team is looking at up to 30 watts per gram.

In another important finding, the TUM team reported that the solar cells continued to produce electricity when turned away from the sun, by soaking up light reflected from the Earth.

That’s an important finding, considering that Earthlings are beginning to take a serious look at traveling to Mars, and beyond into deep space.

TUM team, for one, is already anticipating such a journey.

“Due to their much thinner thickness, the new solar cells could therefore also be used in much dimmer light, for example on missions to the outer solar system on which the sun is too weak for conventional space solar cells,” TUM enthused in a press release.

That thing about thinner thickness also provides advantages for engineering fold-able and flexible devices for space exploration.

“…their key advantage qualifying them as space solar cells is wet-chemical processability at ambient temperatures,” the research team writes. “In contrast to conventional inorganic solar cells, this allows the deposition (via spin coating, printing, spraying, to name a few) of the (sub-)μm thick cells onto ultra-thin and light-weight polymer foils as flexible and foldable substrates.”

The Solar Power Revolution Has Only Just Begun

Meanwhile back on Earth, the US Department of Energy has been a longtime fan of perovskite solar cell technology. In an epic case of perfect timing, last Thursday the agency announced a new round of $20 million in funding for perovskite research, which digs intensively into the field testing issues explored by the TUM team, only Earthbound instead of out there in space.

No, the Energy Department’s big news has not distracted the public eye from the latest news about the *Trump administration, in which various officials face the possibility of serious criminal charges for disrupting the mail (spoiler alert: presidential pardons do not apply to state charges).

However, all of that aside, the new funding round is still big news. It is aimed straight restoring the nation’s PV industry to the global dominance it once enjoyed in the 20th century.

“We will continue to invest in early-stage research and development to improve the affordability, reliability, and value of solar technologies on the grid and position the United States as the world’s leading manufacturer of clean energy technologies,” said Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, perhaps forgetting that his boss promised to save coal jobs, not create new PV jobs.

In this round of funding, the Energy Department is seeking foundational research projects that boost both efficiency and stability beyond current state-of-the-art levels.

The agency is also seeking experienced business partners, both for-profit and nonprofit, to lend a hand with scaling up manufacturing processes.

Perhaps the most important item is the one in which the Energy Department aims to create a gold standard for technology validation.

“Independence and neutrality are required to ensure there are no conflicts of interest between this effort and other projects seeking to demonstrate high-performance devices,” they emphasize. “This center will be responsible for developing and refining test protocols, including accelerated life testing that closely correlates with long-term field performance.”

They are not kidding around about that field testing.

“The center will also be responsible for operating an extensive field testing effort using devices produced by the R&D community to iteratively refine all test protocols and improve community understanding of remaining stability and performance issues,” they continue.

The effort also includes a close look at lifecycle environmental impacts, which is an important consideration in the perovskite solar cell field.

As momentum builds for a green COVID-19 recovery, it sure looks like the Energy Department is determined not to be left behind. Although the agency was recently excoriated for proposing a rollback of water efficiency standards, the new perovskite funding was just one item in a flurry of news pushed out the Energy Department last week, the new ARIES research platform being one of them.

ARIES will enable its host, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, to scale clean tech experiments up to the 20-megawatt level for grid-level applications.

That includes electric vehicles, renewable generation, hydrogen, energy storage, and grid-interactive efficient buildings according to the Energy Department, so it looks like the new round of perovskite funding will dovetail with the effort.

What was that about coal jobs again?

Hitting hard on the three and half years of the Trump administration during her first appearance after being picked as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic party on Tuesday, Harris, 55, presented a long list of missteps taken by the current US government.

“As Biden-Harris Administration, we will create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution, bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in America, build on the Affordable Care Act so everyone has the peace of mind that comes with health insurance, and finally offer caregivers the dignity, the respect, and the pay they deserve,” she said.

“We’ll protect a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own body, root out systemic racism in our justice system, and pass a new Voting Rights Act, a John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted,” Harris added.

During her speech along side Biden, Harris said the case of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence is open and she has worked every day to hold the officials accountable to the American people.

“Let me tell you, as somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” said Harris.

“And the people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in the White House,” she said.

During the speech she mentioned a lot of sectors where the current administration has created a complete mess.

“Just look where they’ve gotten us. More than 16 million out of work, millions of kids who cannot go back to school, a crisis of poverty, of homelessness afflicting black, brown, and indigenous people the most, a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers, who have children that are hungry, and tragically, more than 165,000 lives that have been cut short, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye,” she said.

“It didn’t have to be this way. Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis. It was called Ebola. And we all remember that pandemic. But you know what happened then? Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died, two,” Harris said.

That is what’s called leadership, she told the audience.

“But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. While other countries were flattening the curve, he said the virus would just, poof, go away like a miracle,” she alleged.

She said it was due to the fault of the Trump administration that the US had to shut down various of its regions again while other countries were opening up.

“So when other countries open back up for business what did we do? We had to shut down again. This virus has impacted almost every country, but there’s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation,” she said.

Harris alleged that it is because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously from the start. “His refusal to get testing up and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. All of that is reason, and the reason that an American dies of Covid-19 every 80 seconds,” she said.

“It’s why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good. It’s why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools. Mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about childcare, and the safety of their kids at school, whether they’ll be in danger if they go or fall behind if they don’t. Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden,” she said.

Harris said that this is what happens when one elects a person who just isn’t up for the job”. “Our country ends up in tatters, and so does our reputation around the world. But let’s be clear.This election isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It’s about building this country back better, and that’s exactly what Joe and I will do,” she said.

She said the Biden-Harris administration will ensure equality for the people of America.

“The civil rights struggle is nothing new to Joe. It’s why he got into public service. It’s why he helped reauthorise the Voting Rights Act and restore unemployment discrimination--and employment discrimination laws. And today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march toward equality and justice as only--as the only, as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate,” Harris said.","Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic party’s vice-presidential nominee, has said once elected, the Joe Biden administration will create millions of jobs, fight climate change and build an affordable care act among various other strong initiatives for the welfare of Americans.

216,https://cleantechnica.com/2020/08/12/the-jackrabbit-version-2-0-e-bike-makes-riding-electric-easy-affordable/,"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CleanTechnica,The JackRabbit Version 2.0 E-Bike Makes Riding Electric Easy & Affordable,"Here at CleanTechnica, we are all about getting more people onto zero emission transportation of all shapes and sizes. We first met the team at JackRabbit Mobility at CES 2019 where I was one of the first people to ride on their version 1.0 prototype. After an initial production run and a ton of new innovations, founder Tom Piszkin and team are back with version 2.0 of the newly rebranded JackRabbit.

They brought a prototype of version 2.0 to my house for me to test out and I was impressed at how the two-wheeled electric strider, at just over 20 pounds, was able to handle my 200+ pound frame. Designer and relentless innovator Tom Piszkin has decades of experience tearing bicycles apart to repair and improve them and has brought a number of improvements to the new JackRabbit. Tom left the prototype of the JackRabbit with me for a few weeks ahead of the official launch on Kickstarter.

An Economical Transportation Solution

At its core, the JackRabbit is a compact two-wheeled electric strider. Riders simply put their feet down and give it a push to get moving, and use the throttle from there. It has a range of 9 to 18 miles per charge, which varies depending on terrain, rider weight, weather, and use of the thumb-actuated paddle throttle. The prototype we tested had a more complex throttle, and the upgrade to a paddle throttle should make the experience much more straight-forward.

The JackRabbit supports riders of up to 240 pounds, so at 210 pounds, I put the little guy to the test. It’s clearly optimized for smaller riders, but I was more than comfortable riding and striding around town on it while on a family bike ride. Getting the JackRabbit in and out of the car is a breeze, thanks to its 23-pound weight. The quick release handlebars flip to the side to make it easier to store and transport.

Hopping on the JackRabbit, a quick push off gets the strider moving and enables the throttle. The JackRabbit has to be moving for the throttle to activate, but that’s just a matter of pushing off with a foot or two to get things rolling. After the strider is in motion, you can pull your feet up onto a pair of flip down pegs at the bottom of the unit.

Compact & Efficient

The small size of the JackRabbit means fewer materials are needed to assemble it, less power is needed to move it around town, and it can be shipped directly to customers in a compact box. In the campaign, the team mentions that they ship the JackRabbit to customers without any styrofoam, instead opting to use the cushion from the tires and seat as padding for the shipment.

Its small size makes the JackRabbit a good fit for short commutes on college campuses, corporate campuses, and last mile commutes. Its compact size opens up the option for use on boats and RVs. OK, so you probably wouldn’t use it on the boat, but it’s a great option for owners looking for something they can get around with after parking or docking.

Accessories

Mr. Piszkin is a ceaseless innovator and has developed a range of accessories for the JackRabbit. Many of his innovations are packed into the JackRabbit itself, like the handlebars that fold flat, the removable battery, and the various iterations of the vehicle itself.

To offer as much flexibility and utility to owners, Tom has a range of accessories planned for the JackRabbit. A removable battery with a case that lets owners store it under the seat is my personal favorite as its compact size highlights just how efficient the JackRabbit is.

A shoulder carry strap makes it easier for riders to move the JackRabbit around and a rear rack platform that bolts right onto the seat post let owners further customize their ride.

Conclusion

At the Kickstarter Early-Bird price of $499 ($999 MSPR), the JackRabbit is an affordable personal electric mobility solution for many. Its light weight and compact form factor likely make it a practical solution for many living in high rises, college dorms, boats, RVs, and more where a full-sized bicycle simply won’t fit.

As it comes from the factory, it clearly isn’t built for riders much more than 200 pounds, though I found it comfortable enough for a few miles around town. I could imagine a more built out JackRabbit kitted out with a rear rack, some saddle bags, a more plush seat, and an extra battery making a great setup for longer distances, though at that point, I might be looking for a more robust electric bike that would let me do some of the work.

The JackRabbit is yet another example of the endless opportunity for innovators to leverage the ever increasing supply of lithium-ion batteries and electric motors to dream up new mobility solutions for the masses.

The Lectric XP Step-Thru builds on the success of the Lectric XP with a lower standover height to make getting on and off easier. Low-step frames are absolutely clutch when carrying weight on the racks, and they are just plain easier to mount and dismount. Speaking of carrying capacity, the Lectric XP Step-Thru might be shorter and more portable than most e-bikes, but it can hold its own with an impressive rider carrying capacity of 275 pounds (124.7 kg) and a rear rack cargo capacity of 55 pounds (25 kg).

“Our customers have been requesting a model like this for quite some time,” says Deziel. “We are now able to accommodate individuals who have always wanted an e-bike but have been hesitant to purchase one due to concerns about their ability to easily get onto the bike.”

Lectric eBikes first caught my eye when I saw what looked like a compact folding bike carrying an adult around without making it look like a circus act. What makes it all work is the 20″ x 4″ tires that give the bike a robust base and a bit of cushion without having to go full bore with suspension. The massive tires of the new step-through, which launches in September at an introductory price of $899, underpin a robust but compact folding frame.

At just under $900, quality is the biggest question when it comes to Lectric bikes, but it seems to have things on lock. LG batteries underpin the electric side of the game, while Shimano and Tektro components handle the human side of the contribution.

At just over 1 year old, Lectric eBikes was born when co-founders Levi Conlow and Robby Deziel noticed a gap in the market for an affordable e-bike built with quality components. Apparently, consumers also saw this gap, as they flocked to the brand.

Since launching in May 2019, the duo has sold more than 15,000 e-bikes.

Finding affordable housing is often a struggle, even when the economy is good. PadSplit aims to make it easier with a marketplace that shows available shared housing opportunities for low-income workers.

To carry on with its mission-driven work, the Atlanta-based company closed on a Series A funding totaling $10 million on Wednesday. PadSplit brought in $5.7 million back in April and is pairing it with $4.3 million in new funds, founder and CEO Atticus LeBlanc told Crunchbase News. This brings the company’s total fundraise to $14.6 million since being founded in 2017.

Core Innovation Capital led the round, which also included Alate Partners, Citi, Kapor Capital, Impact Engine and Cox Enterprises.

“PadSplit provides a truly unique solution to a complicated national problem that’s becoming more dire each day,” said Arjan Schütte, founder and managing partner of Core Innovation Capital, in a written statement. “We’re proud to support Atticus and the PadSplit team as they expand into new markets and introduce critical housing supply at a time when so many require affordable housing.”

As a result of the economy and the global pandemic, as well as the federal eviction moratorium ending last month, 12 million low-income households are under threat of eviction, The Washington Post reported in July.

Hoping to reverse this course, PadSplit’s platform aligns incentives among property owners, cities and the individuals who need affordable housing.

Here’s how the model works: PadSplit uses existing housing stock to convert single-family homes or apartments into shared housing for workers and retirees earning less than $35,000 a year. The company operates more than 1,000 units, primarily in Atlanta, but also in Houston, as well as Virginia, Alabama and Maryland.

Room rates average $109 per week and include furniture, utilities, Wi-Fi, laundry, telemedicine visits and credit reporting for all on-time payments. Members are able to save $516 per month on average, enabling them to purchase their own vehicles, build credit histories and ultimately move into their own apartments or homes, LeBlanc said.

Meanwhile, the company will use the funds to scale in new markets, including ramping up in Houston, and give more cities the ability to tackle their affordable housing crisis without requiring additional taxpayer dollars.

“There is lots to be built out on the product, but we are thrilled with the progress we have made in the last 12 to 18 months, where now essentially any owner can onboard a property,” he added. “We have proven what we need to do and are focusing on expansion, particularly now with the looming eviction crisis.”

Sterling Alternative Finance (SAF), the non-interest banking division of Sterling Bank Plc, says it has developed a clean and affordable energy solution for homes and businesses across the country.

Mohammed Yinusa Head of Digital Business, SAF made this known in a statement on Sunday.

Yinusa said the energy solution known as Altpower, came with a package of financing that would provide consumers with flexible and pocket-friendly options.

He said that Altpower was designed to provide accessible alternative – solar and renewable- power solutions to homes, businesses and public institutions in the country through monthly or installment-payment plan.

“It offers a more reliable and affordable energy source to under served homes and businesses as well as those living and doing business in communities that do not have any access to electricity.

“It is a reliable, accessible and affordable solution that is scalable to meet every customer’s desired energy needs.”

READ ALSO:

While listing available options, he urged individuals and businesses that needed reliable and affordable power solutions to visit Altpower.ng to start enjoying uninterrupted power supply through buy outright, lease to own or Power as a service (Paas) subscription.

“Outright option is for customers possessing the financial ability to make full payment for the equipment of the alternative energy package of choice.

“However, the lease to own package allows customers that cannot afford to pay at once to spread payment for up to a year without interest.

“For both categories of customers, Altpower curates all the energy products the customer needs to ensure that he has uninterrupted power supply.

“These energy products range from inverters to batteries, UPS, surge protectors, solar home systems among others,’’ he said.

Yinusa said a customer who opted for Paas would have solar powered inverters delivered and installed without making an advance fee or payment, adding that the customer would only be required to pay a monthly rental fee.

“The power and solar powered solution allows customers to charge their batteries when there is sunlight or use power from the grid when sunlight is not available, thereby making it a win-win solution.’’ (NAN)

After a $400 electric bill, a Marion engineer and father looked for ways to save money. He thought solar power sounded like an answer. However, most solar panel installations cost more than $10,000. Jason Jordan put his mind to problem and worked to design a solution: a portable solar panel to put in your yard and plug into a regular outlet. “As a parent of three children, I didn’t have $10,000 lying around. I decided to design an alternative,” Jordan said.

After completing the design, Jordan knew he needed to take the next step, signing up for the Forge program in September of 2019. Upon completion of classes, He entered The Forge Marion business competition to push his idea from the drawing board into reality. With free Forge business classes from Marion Technical College and $2,500 seed money from winning the top prize in the “Shark Tank""-style Forge competition, Jordan has continued to push forward.

Jordan Energy Alternative (JEA) was founded. JEA entered competitions in Columbus as well and made it to the top round before the competition was postponed due to COVID. Though the pandemic threw a wrench into his plans, Jordan continues to move forward. He signed up with the CleanTechOpen, a small business incubator that has helped train 1,600 clean technology start-up entrepreneurs and helped create 3,000 green jobs. He’s working toward a global competition in October where competitors meet with investors. He’s hoping that will help him get the capital to move his company forward.

Jordan has found local mentors and coaches to help him work on marketing, business planning, sales and more. “Marion is rich in knowledge and people who know how to get things done. It is one thing to build a new invention. It’s another to build a company,” Jordan said.

Jordan is working on improving his portable solar panel as well as ways to store excess energy or share it with a neighbor. He sees electric utilities as partners as everyone works to conserve energy.

“Marion has a long history of invention and industry — from Edward Huber revolutionizing agriculture with his hay rakes to the crawler transporters to launch astronauts into space, Marion has changed the world. Jason Jordan is another in this line of inventors. I’m confident he will also make history!“ said Gus Comstock with Marion CAN DO!

It was from the 2016-17 Leadership Marion class, sponsored through the Marion Area Chamber of Commerce, that the Forge classes at MTC got their start, helping Marion build their entrepreneurial businesses.

“It is very exciting to see JEA join so many other successful businesses and nonprofits sparked from The Forge,"" said Matt Carbary, president of the Marion Area Chamber of Commerce. ""Jason is promoting business creation potential here in Marion, and his products will touch lives around the U.S.”

While Jordan burns the midnight oil working on his new business after working all day at Whirlpool, he looks forward to the future while crediting Marion with the push he needs to get started. ""I’m moving forward because of Marion Technical College, The Forge and the Chamber of Commerce,"" said Jordan. ""Without them, it would still just be an idea on a shelf!”

Mattie Rhodes Center’s Northeast Alliance Together (NEAT) broke ground on a new net zero, affordable single-family home at 133 N. Topping Ave. on Monday.

The project, which is being developed in collaboration with Kansas State University (K-State) and CoBuild, is in the Indian Mound neighborhood, which NEAT describes as diverse, tight-knit and eclectic, but threatened by a shortage of quality, safe and affordable housing.

K-State’s School of Architecture will create a thoughtfully-designed, healthy, energy efficient and affordable home that will help a household thrive while also investing in their neighborhood and strengthening their community in the long term.

Director of NEAT Scott Wagner said this project is three years in the making, but in a sense dates back to 2013 when the Mattie Rhodes Center set out to get into housing.

Mattie Rhodes obtained the property from the Land Bank of Kansas City, Missouri and made the request for home funds from the city, which are federal funds.

Wagner thanked former NEAT Director Mary Cyr for her work at the outset of the project.

“There’s a lot of history and a lot of energy that’s been put to this and, frankly, I think a lot of expectation that it would get done so that we could move on to more housing projects,” Wagner said, adding that the hope is that this project will be the first of many similar single-family homes, including new builds and rehabilitation.

Councilman Eric Bunch praised the creative solutions of the design team, contractors and community as a step toward solving problems through affordable, sustainable housing.

CoBuild works with non-profit Emerging Builders, a program that provides on-the-job construction training and educational opportunities for women and people of color (POC), and RK Contractors, which focuses on hiring Middle Eastern refugees and immigrants.

“It feels like a breath of fresh air because we’ve been talking about it for quite a bit and there were so many pieces that were not in place and we didn’t know how they were going to work out,” Emerging Builders Director Yahna Gibson said. “One was getting the panels here, and when that happened it started to feel like it was coming together.”

While it is not Emerging Builders’ first project in Northeast, it is their first project with Mattie Rhodes, and it is their first new build. The 12-week project will begin once the slab has been poured.

“I think because of the involvement that Mattie Rhodes has in the community that [the neighbors are] welcoming it,” Gibson said. “It’s another vacant lot that’s going to get a new house and a new family.”

Beth Beavers, secretary of the Indian Mound Neighborhood Association Board said the board’s focus is on protecting the neighborhood’s current residents and current housing stock, making sure it stays affordable. She worked with K-State students and got to watch them gather input from residents and research the architecture of the neighborhood.

CoBuild manages the job sites, giving the Emerging Builders the opportunity to work under the various tradespeople to learn all the different trades throughout their apprenticeship program.



“My job is to make sure the project gets built to code, to city compliance, and that it’s going to stand up forever,” CoBuild General Contractor Tate Williams said. “I manage our staff that is actually going to be doing the construction, as well as subcontractors of various trades who are going to come help us get this project completed.”

While COVID-19 has affected many industries, Williams said construction hasn’t changed much, aside from macro-level disruptions around shipping and supplies. At his job sites, workers are practicing social distancing, wearing masks and using hand sanitizer regularly.

“It’s really kind of interesting that a lot of people my age, you know, millennials and younger, have talked about construction as sort of like a not as desirable job, or career, but it’s one of the few that’s been deemed essential post-COVID,” he said. “There’s some really interesting things happening around the conversation about construction and about the future work force post-COVID and the reality that we can’t live without good quality, affordable housing.”

Williams is a resident of the Pendleton Heights neighborhood, and sits on the neighborhood association’s board. He said it feels fantastic to contribute to his community in this way, with housing prices creeping up in Pendleton Heights and other Northeast neighborhoods, making affordability increasingly out of reach for a lot of homeowners.

“I’m super excited to be able to be involved in the broader Northeast conversation, both as a representative of the neighborhood, but also as a resident contributing to the broader community, not just Pendleton Heights,” Williams said.

Wagner said choosing CoBuild as the general contractor was somewhat serendipitous.

“I think it’s great in a number of ways,” Wagner said. “One, he’s in Northeast, two, with the connection with Emerging Builders there’s an opportunity to add a training element to this so that now we’re not only talking about affordable housing, but now we’re talking about job creation, we’re talking about training. We’re talking about how – with him as a local partner – to begin to scale this and do more of it.”

NEAT’s mission is to improve the quality of life for all in the Historic Northeast, and one of the organization’s broader goals is to work with various organizations, residents and other stakeholders to bring creative, collective solutions to community needs.

“Throughout the history of Mattie Rhodes, we have been guided by the needs of the most vulnerable, affordable housing is just the latest example of our commitment and service to our community,” said John Fierro, President and CEO of Mattie Rhodes Center.","Partners break ground on NEAT’s first sustainable housing project on N.

The funding, announced by all four members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, includes $19.3 million through the Community Development Block Grant program, which can be used to expand community health facilities, childcare centers, food banks and senior services as well as support eviction prevention, rental deposit assistance and homelessness prevention programs. Another $8.9 million was awarded to the state through the Emergency Solutions Grant program, which provides funding to help homeless people quickly regain permanent housing.

In addition, the city of Manchester received an additional $1.8 million in ESG funding.

About another $3.8 million was awarded through the HOME program, which provides grants to states to help build, buy and rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income households. And $3 million was awarded to New Hampshire through the Housing Trust Fund, which provides grants to states to produce and preserve affordable housing for extremely low- and very low-income households.

“With the expiration of New Hampshire’s eviction moratorium, many vulnerable Granite Staters, including seniors, people with disabilities and working families, risk losing their homes with nowhere to go. Homelessness is a serious problem that has grown exponentially worse from the fallout of Covid-19,” said U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who added that the funds “help bolster and expand access to affordable housing in regions throughout our state.”

Hassan added that Covid-19 “exacerbated the housing crisis in New Hampshire and across the country, and with the expiration of the eviction moratorium, many Granite Staters, including the elderly and those who experience disabilities, are in danger of losing their homes.”

U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-2ndC.D., agreed, saying “no one should have to worry about losing their home and not having a safe place to live, especially during a pandemic, but that is the grim reality many Granite Staters face.”

“As many families across New Hampshire struggle to make ends meet, this additional federal support for affordable housing could not have come at a more important time,” said U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-1stC.D.","New Hampshire is receiving another $39.5 million in federal CARES Act funding to support affordable housing programs and organizations around the state.

“Being a good neighbor to our local community is an important part of our office culture,” said Aaron Taylor, project manager for the first micro-home. “This, coupled with the firm’s mission to provide quality design for everyone, really made working at CommunityFirst! Village a fulfilling experience.”

This first tiny home features what McKinney York Architects’ website describes as “humble modular materials” that “lend dignity to the dwelling through a straightforward, logical aesthetic expression.” The home also includes a screen porch positioned to take advantage of summer breezes while providing shelter from winter winds. Openings encourage cross-ventilation, and a double roof creates shaded heat gain reduction during the warmer months.

“We try to find opportunities for great design, despite the inevitable constraints, whether it’s the size and orientation of an existing concrete slab or the available construction budget,” said Navvab Taylor, leader of the second home design team. The second home includes a butterfly roof to catch breezes and collect rainwater for the garden. Pine paneling accents the interior, and a screened porch keeps mosquitoes away while creating an open public space for socializing.

Finding affordable housing in Southeast Alaska is a challenge even during “normal” times.

“You know there’s such extreme overcrowding, which is our way of dealing with homelessness,” said Jackie Pata, president and CEO of the Tlingit and Haida Regional Housing Authority, which represents 12 Southeast Alaska Tribes. “People in the villages aren’t really homeless. They just join another family or another home.”

But during the pandemic there are extra fears. Fears that the coronavirus could spread quickly in overcrowded, multi-generational households where access to clean water and sanitation can be limited.

So, the housing authority worked with all 12 Tribes to apply for a pot of federal Housing and Urban Development money designated by the CARES Act. So far, nine of those Tribes have been awarded funding. Pata says they tried to propose projects that would have a lasting impact.

“So, I really feel like we’re on the forefront of trying to be making sure the money is being used in a way that it will have an ongoing benefit rather than just being, you know, a shot in the dark, that’s just for a moment in time,” she said.

Alaska Tribes have received 35%, or $18 million, of what’s been dispersed so far.

This is just one piece of the funding puzzle for Tribes to address the impacts of the pandemic, but it’s an important one, says Alaska HUD Director Colleen Bickford.

“You know it’s gonna hopefully improve the overall health and healthy homes across the state,” she said.

She says the money is for projects that address immediate threats to the health and safety of Tribal citizens caused by the pandemic. That could include everything from building new apartments to creating quarantine space to fixing community water lines.

And although infrastructure projects can take time, the money is being distributed as part of an existing program. Bickford says she’s confident the projects will move quickly.

“It’s been a program that’s been widely used in Alaska previously,” she said. “So it’s a well-oiled engine on getting that funding into the hands of the community.”

Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska is one of the largest Tribes in the region. President Richard Peterson says it’s the smaller communities that face the most need.

“Right now, we’re hearing more and more cases in our villages, so we’re worried about that,” he said. “And as Juneau’s also a regional hub, so I know people are reaching out even from the village asking us what we can to help with housing issues and isolation and quarantine.”

Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska has received $1.5 million to build affordable housing to address overcrowding in Juneau. It’s also working on a youth homeless shelter in Juneau.

Peterson says he sees these projects and others they’ve used CARES Act funding for — like an emergency response center — as part of a broader effort to increase emergency preparedness and resilience in the communities they serve across Southeast Alaska.

“So, we’re building ourselves so that we will be able to respond, that we’ll be able to be a resource for our communities to carry them through any, whether it’s a fire or a tsunami or lack of ferry service, which I think we’re gonna see again this winter,” he said.

The final round of funding is expected to be completed by the end of August.","As part of the CARES Act, Congress appropriated $100 million earlier this year to help Tribes cope with housing and sanitation issues during the coronavirus pandemic.

(Manufacturer photo)

Hyundai’s all-new Venue subcompact is the company’s most affordable SUV, undercutting the previous titleholder, the Kona, by about $3,000.

Venue is smaller than Kona, less powerful, and not available with all-wheel drive, but do not pity it. The Venue is charming, easygoing, roomy inside, a godsend in tight-squeeze urban situations, and more fuel-efficient than Kona.

Like all Hyundais, the Venue comes with a great warranty and maintenance plan: a limited warranty of five years or 60,000 miles, powertrain warranty of 10 years or 100,000 miles, and complimentary maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.

The 2020 Venue has three trim levels: SE, SEL, and Denim. Pricing with destination charge included starts at $18,490 for an SE with a six-speed manual transmission. If a manual transmission piques your interest, this is the only model available with one, and be aware that it is being discontinued for 2021.

An SE with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is $19,690. Hyundai calls its version IVT, for intelligent variable transmission.

The SEL is priced at $20,390 and the Denim model goes for $23,190. Both have the IVT automatic transmission.

The same engine is used in all Venue models, a 1.6-liter four-cylinder generating 121 horsepower. Fuel economy ratings with a manual transmission are 27 mpg city, 35 mpg highway, and 30 mpg combined. With the automatic, the ratings are 30/34/32 mpg.

The 2020 Hyundai Venue interior is solid, tidy, and assembled with precision. (Manufacturer photo)

Some of the standard features on the Venue SE are 15-inch steel wheels, manual six-way adjustable driver’s seat, cruise control, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, remote keyless entry system, remote liftgate release, an 8-inch touchscreen audio system with four speakers, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability, and a safety suite of driver-assistance technology including forward-collision avoidance and lane keeping.

All 2020 Venue models have cloth seats and a 60/40 split fold-down rear seatback. With seatbacks in upright position, the cargo area provides 18.7 cubic feet of space, and with seats folded, 31.9 cubic feet.

I drove the Venue SEL model, whose added features include alloy wheels, automatic climate control, snow driving mode, a center console storage box with driver’s armrest, two USB charging ports, and six-speaker audio.

The SEL trim also allows for some desirable optional features, such as 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, heated front seats, heated outside mirrors, sunroof, proximity key with push button start, navigation, and blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.

The above optional items are clustered into two packages: Convenience ($1,150) and Premium ($1,750). My tester was equipped with both packages.

Venue’s interior lacks some of the fancier details found in more expensive cars, like lots of soft-touch surfaces, but it is solid, tidy, and put together with precision. Visibility is excellent and headroom is plentiful for both rows of seats. Rear seat legroom, often sacrificed in a subcompact to give driver and front passenger space to stretch out, is pretty good in the Venue.

The infotainment system is an agreeable, uncomplicated system with manual operation in addition to the touchscreen. Its control buttons and dials, along with those of the climate system, are large and sturdy.

Venue’s ride is serene except for travel at freeway speeds on uneven surfaces such as the entirety of I-5, when things can get a bit raucous. Not unbearable, though. The small engine doesn’t blow the doors off other vehicles, but it does a fine job of accelerating from a standstill and providing momentum during nonhyper driving.

As Indian living rooms go larger and wider than ever, thanks to the shifts in the realty market and how home designs change over time, TV makers are now rolling out televisions with larger and thinner screens with swanky designs and better display, given that the broadband revolution has made streaking of ultra HD content affordable and accessible, even in small towns and rural India.

TCL, popular for a wide spectrum of electronics products including TVs, is one of the leading players in India that experiment with innovative features and impressive pricing. TCL’s recently launched premium television series -- the C815 -- sticks to the company’s legacy. The 4K QLED TV comes in three variants: 55-inch (Rs 69,990), 65-inch (Rs 99,990) and 75-inch (Rs 1,39,990).

Neat interface and design

The most noticeable feature about this QLED TV is the integrated speaker boxes, which are placed at the bottom of the slim TV. The device is a lean beauty. It has a less-bezels design and the entire form factor is quite appealing to the eye. The TV comes with basic table-top mounting stands, which are easy to set up. TCL doesn’t provide the wall-mounting gears along with the TV but the installation personnel will be able to help you with that.

We tested the 75-inch variant, wall-mounted. The Android TV with built-in Google Chromecast feature runs of a decent CPU (ARM’s 64-bit A55×4 900MHz ~ 1.1GHz) blacked by a power-efficient graphic chip, ARM’s Mali 470 (600MHz ~800MHz), which powers several power-sensitive smartwatches and IoT gadgets. The TV has a 2 GB RAM. We haven’t experienced any noticeable lags in the way the TV plays content, including 4K and UHD video, even though the booting experience takes a little longer than expected.

Once alive, the device is ready to kick. The TCL C815 comes with a neat user interface. Navigating through the UI is an easy task. The basic software setup takes only a few minutes. You can connect the TV to the network and start streaming right away. The TV features a neat row of useful ports: three HDMI slots, two USB 2.0 ports, one each for digital audio, DTH cable antenna, ethernet, AV-in and the headphone.

There is no option to link the TV to an external audio source via bluetooth, though. Usually at night, playing loud audio becomes an issue at most homes; so in general people love connecting the screen to an efficient headphone via bluetooth and enjoy the TV experience. You will miss that here and have to rely on the built-in speakers. The built-in ONKYO audio system offers an output of 2x15W+20W.

Even on a low-intensity broadband connection (less than 20 Mbps speed), the TV rendered video effortlessly, adjusting automatically to the resolution and optimising the performance -- which is an impressive feat, something we generally see in super-premium TVs. The launcher page shows Google Play, featured apps and the source menu. Most streaming apps are supported by the TCL C815. TCL also has an in-house app store from which you can install many entertainment (video and audio) apps.

Premium display and sound

The display panel feels a bit plasticky, but it is robust and strong. The 3840×2160 QLED display with a default aspect ratio of 16:9 is crisp and well-saturated and offers a good viewing angle of 178 degrees. For starters, QLED or quantum dot panels use a metallic quantum dot filter to improve colour and contrast. It helps play HDR and 4K content smoothly. We haven’t experienced any bleeds or blurs while playing videos, either via USB or while streaming. The TCL C815 supports most known codecs of video and audio, such as the H.265, H.264, MPEG2/4, VC1 and VP9. One of the most interesting facts about the display of the TCL C815 is that it offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, which means if you want to connect it to a gaming console and play games, this is a great option.

Considering the price, and the size, the TCL C815’s display performance is satisfyingly premium. The TV supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Audio. This faculty enables it to deliver a great home-theatre experience. We have tested it on a TATA SKY HD connection and the HD playback experience is quite impressive. The Dolby Audio effect is measured and meticulous. If you have a fairly enclosed living room, the TCL C815 can easily become your mini-theatre inside your home.

That’s mainly because of the built-in ONKYO audio system output, which is not jarring even at high levels. While streaming Netflix movies, we tried extremely high levels of audio and very rarely we experienced twisted audio or rendering lags. The Dolby Vision is also a delight to experience. Several OTT platforms now support the latest Dolby Vision and HDR 10+ content, making video viewing more personal and powerful. During Covid-19, which has hit the movie-going culture deeply, a lot of people, especially regular theatre-goers would miss the large screen, loud-audio experience. To say the TCL C815 can be a good solution to such woes is not an exaggeration.

The TV can be integrated with Google Assistant and can be controlled with voice commands. If you have a fast internet connection, the hands-free experience is smooth, else it’s a lot of pain. The voice-command faculty is a boon, especially considering that the small remote TCL provides along with the TV is prone to damage if you’re not really careful.

Users are recommended to keep it in a casing else it can malfunction even after a moderate fall on the floor as has happened in our case. Unlike in the earlier models of the TCL LED TVs, the standard remote is not available with the C815 so you don’t have a fallback option. That said, the TCL app features an online remote controller which you can connect to the TV via Wi-Fi. It doesn’t work offline. If your smartphone has the infrared remote faculty, that can also be used here. A lot of smartphones, such as those from Xiaomi, features TV remotes.

In sum, the TCL C815 is an efficient QLED TV with premium looks and specs and a price tag that fits your budget. Considering that buying a TV is an act most families do once in a few years, unlike in the case of a smartphone, the TCL 4K QLED TV can easily be a good choice for an Indian family that wants a bigger, louder and better TV experience.

Pros: Premium design, thin panels, great display, built-in speakers, superb audio

Cons: Fragile remote, handsfree experience is not up to the mark, no Alexa support, heats up during long hours of use

Neat interface and designThe most noticeable feature about this QLED TV is the integrated speaker boxes, which are placed at the bottom of the slim TV.

This will help in getting more investment even from Sovereign Wealth Fund and Pension Fund and long-term finance from bank and financial institutions at easier terms

“Affordable Rental Housing Complex is included in the Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Sub-sectors by insertion of a new item in the category of Social and Commercial Infrastructure,” a notification issued by Economic Affairs Department of the Finance Ministry said. ARHC was announced under part of Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan announced in May this year.

Benefit of inclusion

With the inclusion of ARHC, number of sub sectors has reached 34 under five categories (Transport & Logistics, Energy, Water & Sanitation, Communication and Social & Commercial Infrastructure) in the harmonised list. All these are eligible to raise money from sovereign wealth fund, pension funds, insurance companies, with a longer tenure and on easier terms. Cheaper credit through External Commercial Borrowing Route (ECB) will also be available. Investors investing money in these sectors will get tax benefit.

What is ARHC

ARHC means a project to be used for rental purpose only for urban migrant/poor (Economically Weaker Section/Lower Income Group categories) for a minimum period of 25 years with basic civic infrastructure facilities such as water, sanitation, sewerage/septage, road, electricity along with necessary social/commercial infrastructure. Initial rent will be fixed by local authority/entities based on local survey of surrounding area wherein the project is situated. Project means a listed project having at least 40 dwelling units of double room or single room or equivalent dormitory units or a mix of all three in any ratio but not more than one third of total built up area under double bedrooms units.

Dwelling Units (DUs) means a unit comprising of double bed room with living area, kitchen, toilet and bathroom of up to 60 square metres carpet area or single bed room with living area, kitchen, toilet and bathroom of up to 30 square metres carpet area. Dormitory Units means a set of 3 dormitory bed with common kitchen, toilet and bathroom in 30 square meters carpet area meaning 10 square meters carpet area per dormitory bed.

ARHC intends to help migrant labour/urban poor face challenges in getting houses at affordable rent. As a part of PM Awaas Yojana, the scheme will provide ease of living by converting government funded housing in the cities into ARHC under PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode through concessionaire. The scheme will incentivize manufacturing units, industries, institutions, associations to develop such complex on their private land and operate. There is also provision to incentivize State Government Agencies/Central Government Organizations on the similar lines to develop ARHC and operate.","Finance Ministry has included ‘Affordable Rental Housing Complex’ (ARHC) under Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure Sub-sectors.

There was the green papaya shredder, the AeroPress coffee maker, the onion goggles (yeah, those were a thing.)

But one sharp-beaked bird keeps flying back into my hands.

My Dexter Chinese-style cleaver has occupied a perpetual spot in the cutlery lineup, even if it goes unused for months at a time. We recently reconnected over a shredded carrot salad. There’s no better tool for reducing veggies to a pile of finely julienned ribbons — or countless other kitchen tasks. It’s been back in continuous use since.

Make no mistake: If you’ve never handled this kind of blade, you’re in for a revelation. And that goes far beyond thinking of its possibilities in the scope of Asian cuisines.

It’s a multitasker capable of handling nearly any kitchen task with ease and grace. And at less than $40 bucks, there isn’t much argument against adding one to your block of blades.

On ExpressNews.com: See what recipes we’re creating and cooking here. Bookmark the page!

While these things look a lot like a hefty cleaver, the Chinese-style chef’s knife is a remarkably nimble tool for slicing, dicing, mincing, smashing and so on. It has the heft to separate a rack of ribs into a heap of bones with one clean slice and the dexterity to quickly reduce a pile of herbs into feathery powder.

The tip is easy to control for many of the small jobs where you might normally reach for a paring knife. And the expansive slab of steel it’s forged from also makes a perfect shovel for transporting large quantities of prepped ingredients to the skillet, wok or pot you have waiting on the stove. If you’re in a pinch, the butt of the handle can even double as a makeshift pestle for smashing peppercorns, star anise, garlic cloves or anything else in need of a good crushing.

On ExpressNews.com: Our guide to knives will give you an edge in the kitchen

While the Chinese-style cleaver probably won’t replace your trusty French chef’s knife — an incredibly flexible tool in its own right — you may find yourself reaching for it more often than not once it feels comfortable in your hand.

In other kitchen exploits, I spent the week firing up my slow cooker to prepare a quartet of family-friendly recipes for all the parents out there with kiddos heading back to school. If you’re in need of an easy meal the whole household is sure to enjoy, give any of the following dishes a try.

The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday announced the additional special liquidity facility of Rs 5,000 crore each at its policy lending rate to Nabard and the NHB.Under this, small non-bank finance companies and micro-lenders, which extend small-sized loans to the poor, and housing finance companies focused on affordable lending are going to get liquidity assistance via Nabard and the NHB, respectively.This is the second support offered to these institutions since the country went into a nationwide lockdown in March.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.

The idea of a robot maid going around your home and consistently cleaning your floors and carpeting sounds like a high-end luxury. These days, though, it’s not. Over the years, automated floor cleaners, aka robot vacuums, have become affordable for the average person. Yes, brand name models like the iRobot i7+ can be pretty pricey, but there are great values to be found out there as well.

We’ve tested robot vacuums at every price point in our labs, and through our testing, we’ve found some exceptional low-cost models. They may not have cutting-edge technology, but not everyone needs the latest and greatest—especially if you’re looking for a robot vacuum to give you a helping hand between your regular manual cleanings.

Our testers put every robot vacuum on this list through our custom-built obstacle course that simulates everything from table legs to throw rugs. We also ensure that every robot vacuum that gets our approval can handle dirt, crumbs, and pet hair.

After evaluating dozens of entry-level models, we think the Eufy Robovac 11S (available at Amazon for £179.99) tops the charts, both in terms of performance and value.

These are the best affordable robot vacuums we tested ranked, in order:

Eufy Robovac 11S Neato Botvac D3 Connected iRobot Roomba 698 EcoVacs Ozmo 920

BEST OVERALL

Eufy Robovac 11S

Credit: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan

The Eufy Robovac 11S is the heir to the much-loved Robovac 11. This robot vacuum does its predecessor proud, offering excellent suction and improved navigation. A slimmer design allows the S to get its brushes into more places.

During our testing, the 11S picked up around 11.6 grams of dirt per run, more than what most iRobot models manage. We also noted that during operation, the 11S was quiet, rarely making enough noise to interrupt a conversation. The combination of good dirt pickup and quiet operation make the 11S one of our favourite robot vacuums.

Pros

Very affordable

Slim design allows it to clean more areas

Good dirt pickup performance

Cons

Can get caught on the edge of small rugs

Clean cycles can last up to two hours long

HOW WE TESTED

The Tester

Hey, I'm Jon Chan, the senior lab technician at Reviewed. If you clean with it—whether it’s laundry detergents or dishwashers—I oversee its testing. This expertise extends to vacuums: upright, canister, handheld, and robotic.

Over the years, I’ve gotten my hands on hundreds of vacuums, and this article is about the best of every type I’ve tested. When it comes to the absolute pinnacle, it’s all about how well each model can clean up a mess.

The Tests

Most of the tests involve our robot obstacle course. The area contains analogues for furniture legs, shelves, and thresholds. Each robot vacuum has three chances to prove itself. For the first two runs, we place cork pellets under the shelves and between the furniture legs. When we let the robot vacuum loose, we look at how long a cleaning cycle takes, what obstacles it was able to clean thoroughly, whether its HEPA filters (if it has one) grab onto dust and other allergens, and the overall debris pickup performance. For the final test run, we replace the cork with pet hair and run another test run. We also consider each robot's battery life and build quality.

What You Should Know about Robot Vacuums

With dozens of robot vacuum tests under our belts, we’ve determined that the term “robot vacuum” is inaccurate to describe this machine and what it does. A robot vacuum’s ability to pick up dirt pales in comparison to that of a full-sized vacuum, and a robot vacuum can only really compete over the course of a week. We found that consumers experience the most satisfaction with their robot vacuums if they depend on them to maintain their floors between manual cleanings.

We should also point out that most robot vacuums are designed for bare floors and medium carpet. If you have thick rugs or carpets that are taller than a half-inch, your robot vacuum might not be able to climb atop it or may get stuck. This fact is vital for pet owners because it means pet beds are a point of contention. They have enough give that robot vacuums can get caught on their corners and partially climb atop.

Avoiding Robot Vacuum Pet Mishaps

Over the years, three technologies have developed to help keep robot vacuums from running amok: magnetic strips, virtual barriers, and app-based barriers. All three of these methods have their pros and cons.

Magnetic strips are the simplest. Lay them on the floor, and they create a barrier that designated robot vacuums will not cross. While they don’t require batteries, magnetic strips are cumbersome. Most robot vacuums that included magnetic strips with purchase price only include one. If you want to cover multiple entryways or create multiple barriers, you’ll have to cut it.

Virtual barriers are battery-powered devices that emit an infrared line that tells robot vacuums to turn back. Some specialised barriers, like iRobot’s Lighthouse, can create a 'halo', or a circle barrier to encompass a piece of furniture or a pet bowl.

Specialised apps work alongside a robot vacuum with mapping technologies to virtually map an area, draw lines to denote where the robot can and cannot go, and share the information between the vacuum and your smart device. Companies like iRobot, Neato, and Ecovacs all have machines that use this smart mapping technology.

Robot Vacuum vs Traditional Vacuum

Whenever you have a device that’s battery-powered over one that runs on a cord, you’re going to have to deal with a series of compromises. With robot vacuums, it’s a balancing act between being a good robot and a good vacuum.

A good robot navigates well by not bumping into furniture and getting over thresholds. But, a robot vacuum’s worst downfall is when it gets stuck and requires a helping hand from a human, defeating its purpose as an automated floor cleaner. Being a good robot means drawing power away from the brushes and to the wheels, sensors, and circuit board.

Conversely, a robot vacuum that cleans well also tends to ram itself into furniture. While this isn’t great for your furniture, it’s pretty good for your floors. A robot vacuum can’t clean where its brushes haven’t been and bumping into table legs helps clean nooks and crannies. They also tend to be noisier as more power is drawn to the suction motor.

Our comprehensive testing has shown that there tends to be an inverse relationship between the cost of a robot vacuum and its ability to pick up dirt. We’re talking about a 20-per cent difference between the best navigators that never get close to a chair leg and a robot vacuum that scuffs everything in your house. The most exceptional robot vacuums tend to win our Editor’s Choice and Best of Year awards.

Different Types of Navigation

Robot vacuums tend to have two different types of navigation, infrared and optical; some have a combination of both. Infrared sensors shoot beams that give information about distance. Optical navigation involves cameras, usually mounted on the top of the unit. Typically, these cameras utilise contrast and landmarks to decipher where they are. Robot vacuums that rely on optical navigation cannot work in a pitch-black room.

How Long do Robot Vacuums last?

This is a tricky question. We have found that the battery is the shortest-lived part of a robot vacuum. Both nickel and lithium-based batteries have hard limits on the number of times they can recharge. Nickel batteries suffer from a limitation known as memory loss—basically, over time, they lose the ability to recharge fully. And, for lithium batteries, their cathodes tend to wear out after a few years. You can generally expect to buy a new battery pack for your robot vacuum after two to four years of use, depending on how often you run your device.

Are Robot Vacuums Worth the Money?

If you’re a pet owner, a robot vacuum can help you snatch up the furballs that seem to be blowing like tumbleweeds everywhere in your home. It’ll save you time and energy, as well as frustration. Get your money’s worth by setting it to automatically run every day. Getting one that features its own app is a bonus for those times you need to give your floors a once-over before coming home to any last-minute surprise guests.

OTHER ROBOT VACUUMS WE TESTED

Neato Botvac D3 Connected

Credit: Reviewed.com / Jonathan Chan

We're big fans of the Neato D3 Connected. It's an affordable robot vacuum that excels at dirt pickup, cleaning floors just as well as robot vacuums that cost twice the price. It did especially well on pet hair.

While it's the most expensive vacuum on our list, it also comes with WiFi connectivity. That means you can tell Alexa or Google Home to start vacuuming—or you can start your D3 from your smartphone, anywhere in the world.

Pros

Good at dealing with pet hair

Able to direct towards or away from specific rooms

Cons

Bulky shape prevents it from cleaning tight spaces

Can get caught in corners

Get the Neato Botvac D3 Connected from Amazon for £328.66

iRobot Roomba 698

Credit: Reviewed.com / Jonathan Chan

The Roomba 698 replaces the 650 as the entry-level offering from iRobot, one of the best-known names in the world of home robotics. On sale for as low as £299, it comes WiFi connectivity and remote control with a smartphone app. This means it's the most affordable connected robot vacuum from a major manufacturer.

So why isn't this superb cleaner our favourite? Well, it still has a few flaws. For instance, it's based on the iRobot 650, which is rough on furniture, hitting the table and chair legs with 3.3 pounds of force in our tests. That's hard enough to knock an item off the edge of a table.

The Roomba 606 can be had for even less money, (around £249 last time we checked) but it loses value in our eyes because it lacks both connectivity and the ability to schedule cleaning ahead of time.

Pros

Very affordable

Can start via the app

Moderate dirt pickup performance

Cons

Bumps hard into furniture

Can get caught on thick carpet

Get the iRobot Roomba 698 from iRobot for £299.99

EcoVacs Deebot Ozmo 920

Credit: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan

Jacks of all trades may be a master of none, but do they tend to be cost-effective. The Ecovacs 920 stands as a shining example. It’s a combination robot vacuum and mop that handles both in stride.

On average, the 920 picked up a respectable 10.6 grams of dirt per run. While that isn’t the highest we’ve seen, even in this price range, it’s the only model that can also act as an automated Swiffer.

Pros

Affordable

Can also dry mop

Cons

Moderate dirt pickup for the price

But what’s a girl to do when she’s not ready to splurge on fine jewelry but is over cheap jewelry? The solution lies in the industry's budding demi-fine market. For the past few years, there’s been an explosion of demi-fine brands creating pieces that bridge the gap between costume and high-end jewelry.

What exactly classifies a jewelry brand as demi-fine? Typically with fine jewelry, you see pieces made out of precious stones and metals with larger price tags, while costume jewelry uses metal alloys and has prices below $100. Demi-fine jewelry merges these two mediums by creating pieces made with gold (below 18 karats) and silver or plated pieces paired with semi-precious stones, hitting that sweet spot under $400. The result? A rising class of demi-fine jewelry brands that have taken over our Instagram feeds.

If you haven’t seen the demi-fine jewelry brands in your feed yet, don’t fret, because we’ve rounded up 18 that have been leading the charge in making finer jewelry far more accessible. Keep reading to find some hidden gems.

When I think of brands that carved out the demi-fine jewelry space in the industry, I think of Missoma. While it may seem this brand is new to the scene, as it’s gained popularity on Instagram recently, don’t be fooled. Marisa Hordern actually founded Missoma in London back in 2008. The brand’s rise in the cultural zeitgeist can be attributed in part to fans like Meghan Markle and Kaia Gerber, but what really makes this brand one to watch (and shop) is the fact that it creates 18-karat-gold and silver-plated pieces that are perfect for stacking and mixing and matching with your other favorite jewelry pieces for everyday wear.

Cuchara means ""spoon"" in Tagalog, which seems like a random name for a demi-fine jewelry brand but makes complete sense for the evolution of how Edilou Cañedo founded her brand. What originally started as a passion for collecting vintage spoons and silverware turned into the foundational base of metalwork that makes Cuchara’s jewelry so special. Based out of Toronto, the brand has both an affordable and demi-fine line composed of various fine metals to create a hybrid of pieces inspired by '90s pop culture and nature itself. Basically, every piece of jewelry is like uncovering something beautiful from the past.

Fine jewelry isn’t the only way you can get unique pieces that tell a story. In fact, the demi-fine jewelry brand Alighieri’s story originates in founder Rosh Mahtani’s love for literature. Instead of taking the “typical” route of getting into the jewelry world, Mahtani studied literature at Oxford, where she became enamored with Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy.

This infatuation is what led her to create her demi-fine jewelry brand in 2014. Not only does every piece embody the imperfections and wanderlust of Dante’s story, but this award-winning jewelry brand’s pieces are thoughtfully made with ethically sourced metals produced by craftsmen in London.

When thinking about jewelry, affordability is an important aspect, but it’s not the only thing we should be focusing on as consumers. While fine jewelry may last a lifetime, the implications from the mining industry can be alarming—which is a big part of the thought process behind Vancouver-based brand Wolf Circus. Founded by Fiona Morrison, the brand utilizes recycled sterling silver and bronze pieces that are triple plated in 14-karat gold as a more sustainable demi-fine jewelry option. Not can you feel good about where your jewelry piece comes from, but with prices starting under $100, the brand is the epitome of attainable and sustainable luxury.

Who said that demi-fine jewelry had to focus on gold and silver pieces primarily? In fact, one of the things that distinguish demi-fine jewelry definitively from costume and fine jewelry is its ability to meld different materials to create out-of-this-world pieces—and no other brand is doing that quite like Ejing Zhang. The brand was founded in 2015 by London-based Chinese designer Zhang, and her work has become lauded by fashion girls for its quirky incorporation of resin into the designs. The result is pieces any jewelry collector would be ecstatic to own.

By now you're probably wondering, Are most demi-fine brands internationally based? And while a lot of the jewelry brands that lead the charge in creating the demi-fine market are abroad, there are some U.S.-based jewelry companies worth putting on your radar—such as Forge & Finish. Founded by Desiree Casimiro, Emily Kane, and Carly Mayer in Philadelphia, these women are putting their love for jewelry and metalworking skills to good use by using jewelry to bring awareness to community issues.

For example, with the launch of their most recent collection, they’ve partnered with Clean Water Action to raise awareness and funds around supplying clean-water accessibility to generations to come.

The purpose of the segmentation study across priority sectors like food, apparel, education, health and wellness in Bengaluru is to build a nuanced understanding of women-owned small businesses and to ensure that efforts made to enable growth are mapped to the differing needs of the segments.

The study finds that for women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru to run and scale their businesses, there is an urgent need to increase sales and marketing channels and make them finance ready, so that they can access capital. While women entrepreneurs in the region face formidable challenges, the combination of new market platforms, peer-support networks, capital will make women entrepreneurs a force to reckon with before the end of the decade.

“GAME’s mission is to catalyse 10 million mass entrepreneurs in India by 2030, half of whom will be women. Our study in Bengaluru focused on the four sectors of Food, Apparel, Healthcare and Education that typically have more women entrepreneurs compared to other sectors. Noticeably, even across these four sectors, only 15 per cent are women-owned and of these only 4 per cent employ greater than five people. The study reinforces the sentiment that while women in Bengaluru have many opportunities to build entrepreneurial ventures, the ecosystem lacks in supplementing them with the adequate resources, infrastructure and freedom” said M Srinivas Rao, CEO, GAME.

The study was launched at an event in Bengaluru in the presence of key industry leaders - Ameera Shah, Managing Director, Metropolis Healthcare, Dr. Rajeshwari Ranganathan, President, Association of Women Entrepreneurs (AWAKE), Karnataka; Dr B R Mamatha, Additional Mission Director, SAKALA, Rachna Rao, co-founder, FoodyBuddy; Aarti Mohan, co-founder and Partner at Sattva Consulting; Shailesh Dixit, co-founder, Gromor Finance; Dr. Nina Pais, founder, Ennelle Skin and Hair Co; Venkatesh Panchapagesan, Associate Professor of Finance, Chairperson, NSRCEL and M. Srinivas Rao, CEO, GAME.

“Covid’s impact has made lack of access to affordable credit, more so for women entrepreneurs. Gendered factors in access impede these women entrepreneurs from applying to formal credit. The need of the hour is to bring them under a formal and affordable credit system to help them scale their business” said Aarti Mohan, co-founder and partner at Sattva Consulting. Talking about sustaining business in the new normal, Aarti added, “With Covid severely affecting businesses, women entrepreneurs need to re-look at their business models. As an immediate recourse keeping in line with the new normal, they should be looking at online channels like social media and e-commerce platforms to sustain business. In the mid-to longer term, women need to access more government schemes and stimulus including financial assistance to recover from their negative cash flow.”","Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME) and Sattva Consulting have released a segmentation study report of women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru.

241,https://www.canstarblue.com.au/phone/google-pixel-4a-review/,"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Canstar Blue,Google Pixel 4a Review: the best of Google in an affordable package,"Google’s Pixel phones have always been a bit of an outlier in the smartphone world. The clean Android interface, prompt software updates and great camera have made it a firm favourite amongst the Android faithful but the poor battery life of the Pixel 4 and underwhelming performance of the Pixel 3a meant that it never captured the attention of mainstream consumers, writes Krishan Sharma.

Google’s latest effort, the Pixel 4a, changes all that by building on the strengths of past Pixel phones while also addressing their shortcomings at a price point of just $599. Although it isn’t perfect, the Pixel 4a outclasses every other smartphone within its price range and even manages to trade blows with more expensive rivals.

Hardware and design

The Pixel 4a sports a mid-range processor in the form of a Qualcomm 730G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. There’s no microSD card slot for expandable storage but you do get 100GB of free Google One storage for three months.

Unlike its predecessor, the Pixel 4a comes in only one colour, the appropriately named ‘just black’. The Pixel 4a is understated in its design with a plain polycarbonate back that mightn’t look as premium as some other phones, but it does hide fingerprints and is also less fragile, negating the need for a case.

The grippy texture on the back, coupled with the overall compact size, makes the Pixel 4a very comfortable to operate with one hand which is rare in the age of large and unwieldy slippery glass back phones. Sadly, Google has omitted face unlock entirely in favour of a fingerprint sensor located on the back of the handset.

The Pixel 4a comes with an 18w fast charger but there’s no wireless charging or IP rating for waterproofing. You do, however, get a headphone jack in addition to stereo speakers, which while not the loudest, sounds better than the single firing speakers normally found at this price point.

There’s also dual-SIM support so you can connect to two different carriers with one physical SIM card and one eSIM.

The 5.81-inch OLED display is sharp and well calibrated and comes with the obligatory hole punch camera in the left hand corner. However, I found the display to be very reflective and a bit too dim under direct sunlight. I also came across a bug with the auto-brightness where it would shift dramatically in unchanging light, which I expect will be fixed in a future firmware update, so I ended up leaving it off for now.

Software and performance

Pixel 4a runs Android 10 and will be the first handset to get Android 11 later this year. A key selling point of Pixel phones is the promise of three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which is unheard of at this price point. This means that at the very least, the Pixel 4a will receive Android 13 and will likely end up with Android 14 as well.

The other benefit of using a Pixel phone is you get a stock Android experience devoid of manufacturer bloatware and the same rings true for the 4a with a responsive software experience all round. Coming across from a top tier premium smartphone like the Find X2 Pro from Oppo, I immediately felt the absence of a faster refresh rate display on the Pixel 4a where general day-to-day use felt a bit sluggish by comparison. That’s an unfair comparison though and if you’re coming across from another mid-range or budget smartphone, then the Pixel 4a will be a noticeable step up in performance.

Google Assistant in particular feels more responsive to use than on other handsets and is integrated more seamlessly with a few new perks for Pixel owners such as having the Assistant transcribe conversations and meetings for you (via Google’s Recorder app) which it does entirely on-device and without the need for an internet connection. Transcription accuracy is better than a number of other apps I’ve tried in the past so long as the pronunciation is reasonably clear though it does struggle with accents and jargon.

You can also live caption phone calls, video calls and calls made through apps such as Facebook Messenger. This worked surprisingly well and could be useful as an accessibility feature for the hearing impaired.

All day battery life

At 3,140mAh, the Pixel 4a’s battery might not seem like much but the combination of driving a smaller display with Google’s Adaptive Battery Technology, which automatically reduces power to the apps you rarely use, I was regularly getting through a full day of average use (4-5 hours of screen on time) with around 20 percent charge left in the tank.

A nice touch is that the battery percentage icon is replaced with an estimated time of when the handset will run out of juice whenever you swipe down the notification shade, giving you a better idea of when you should plug it in for a quick charge.

Fantastic camera for the money

Google has been using the very same 12.2MP IMX363 Sony sensor since 2018’s Pixel 3 but once again the company has proven that aging camera sensors can still produce fantastic photos with the right intelligence behind them (though it leaves me to wonder what the company could do with more powerful sensors).

Smartphones in this price range are often guilty of oversaturating and over-processing images while falling apart in low light conditions but the Pixel 4a produces impressive results with just about any type of lighting. Colour and contrast appear more natural and the phone almost always nails the dynamic range of even the most challenging scenes, making the overall image more impactful to the eye.

Having just a single camera means there’s no ultrawide or optical camera though there is a digital zoom of up to 7x that performs best in terms of clarity at up to 3x digital zoom.

There’s also no depth sensor on board but again, this is where Google’s computational photography chops shine once again, producing great looking background blur in portrait mode. The 8MP front-facing camera also performed well for social media selfies and video calls.

Unique to the Pixel 4a is the ability to add background blur to any photo stored on Google Photos even if it was taken years ago on a different device and it worked effortlessly in my testing.

Astrophotography, which originally debuted on 2019’s Pixel 4, works just as well on the 4a provided that you have a steady surface or tripod on hand and a bit of patience. Pointing the camera at the night sky will automatically switch into astrophotography mode capable of capturing impressive looking images of the night sky including stars, planets and even galaxies through a combination of an extremely long exposure time of up to five minutes and some software magic.

For the best results, you need to be in a really dark area free from light pollution but I was still able to capture some starry skies within my residential area.

Panorama mode, where the camera will take multiple shots across a scene and stitch them together to produce one really wide shot, is the weakest aspect of the phone with heavy compression leading to noisy images and visible seams.

Video recording isn’t a strong point of the Pixel 4a either. Despite having excellent stabilisation and good colour reproduction, the impeccable dynamic range that the Pixel 4a displays in stills is inconsistent on the video side and there’s also much more visible noise in anything but ideal lighting conditions.

Overall the Pixel 4a is a camera phone perfect for beginners since it takes very little effort to produce a good looking photo in many scenarios. The camera interface is clean and simple and it will automatically prompt you to use other modes based on what you’re pointing the camera at to get the best possible shot.

The best sub-$600 smartphone

If you’re after an affordable smartphone with the best possible camera and guaranteed software updates, the Pixel 4a won’t disappoint.

Pricing and availability

The Google Pixel 4a is now available for pre-order in Australia on the Google Store and at JB Hi Fi, Vodafone and Harvey Norman for $599. It will be on-sale online from September 10 at those partners and Officeworks, and in store from mid-October.

A 5G variant of the Pixel 4a will be released later this year at a starting price of $799.

Start with this expert advice.","Back-to-school in 2020 comes with some very unique challenges. (GIF: Yahoo Life)

It’s no secret that the 2020-21 school year is going to look a lot different for most children across the country. Schools in many major metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will start school with a fully remote plan, while New York City schools will attempt a hybrid model that mixes remote and in-person learning.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to ameliorate the isolation that is sure to come, parents have taken to geography-based social networking app NextDoor, filling it with posts about wanting to create so-called learning “pods,” or small groups of students who are brought together to learn a common curriculum. Many of these pods are made up of students who are learning remotely due to the pandemic and go to the same school, and while some will be taught by a teacher or tutor — paid for by the pod families — they can also be led by a babysitter or parent.

But experts caution that they take some time and careful thought to create.

“The first thing is figuring out what your priorities and goals as a family and for your kids are,” Michael Horn, innovative education expert and author of Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns, tells Yahoo Life. “You want to be clear [about] the problem you’re trying to solve — childcare, a better academic experience, safety, a better social experience. … The answer shouldn’t be ‘all of the above.’” Figuring out your priorities in advance can be helpful “so when push comes to shove, you know which trade-off you’re going to make,” Horn says. “Safety and socialization can be in conflict with each other.”

Safety first

It’s important, early on, to figure out the rules of the pod and to make sure you find a group of families who will adhere to the rules, Dr. Danelle Fisher, a pediatrician and vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “You have to find families who are like-minded, about learning and the pandemic,” she says. “Rules should be well-established in advance. You want to know what will happen in the instance of, say, somebody were to get COVID-19 or someone in the family of the child who is in the pod does, to make sure everyone stays safe.”

Story continues

Safety is a huge concern, and it can impact even the size of the pod, Dr. Patricia Garcia, a pediatrician at Connecticut Children’s Hospital, tells Yahoo Life. “The number one thing that parents need to decide is how many children they will allow into the pod,” she says. “As the number of children increases, the risk of exposure [to COVID-19] increases.”

But parents also need to think about a variety of other safety issues, experts say, including…

Daily prescreening: Doing temperature and symptoms checks at the door is important, Fisher says.

Extracurricular activities: “Are the children in the pod allowed to play on sports teams? What about extracurricular activities? Social activities like family gatherings? What about travel? If one child is traveling often or attending large family gatherings, then the rest of the group’s risk of exposure increases,” Garcia says.

Potential exposure: Parents will need to decide what will happen if a family or child travels or has extended exposure to people outside the pod, Garcia says: “Will the child quarantine? If so, for how long?”

Location: Ideally, the location for a pod will be well-ventilated, easy to clean and have a designated bathroom to minimize exposure to others, Garcia says.

Physical distancing: Desks should be at least 3 to 6 feet apart in a perfect scenario, Fisher says. “It’s really important to keep the kids socially distant when they’re learning, especially indoors,” she says.

Masks: Parents should decide in advance whether they want to mandate wearing masks in the pod, Fisher says. “Masks are going to be important and appropriate here,” she says.

Food: Figuring out how food allergies will be handled, as well as how utensils will be washed, is crucial, Garcia says.

Childhood vaccines: While COVID-19 is the main reason most families are creating pods, children are at risk of contracting other illnesses. “I’ve been telling families to discuss influenza and other childhood vaccines, and to come up with an agreement regarding,” Garcia says.

Parent on site: “If you’re meeting at someone’s house, a parent has to be there,” Fisher says. “Otherwise, there could be legal ramifications in different states about that being viewed as a daycare situation.”

Other important considerations: Access, fees

In general, learning pods are happening in areas where school curricula are in place. In those cases, the pod instructor is simply guiding and overseeing lessons from their teacher, Horn says. However, he adds, there is an opportunity to introduce more elements of hybrid learning, like supplemental videos, and instructions that are more tailored to the students and their interests. It really depends on the pod, the collective goals of the pod and how much effort everyone wants to put into it.

But safety, socialization, local laws and learning aren’t the only things to consider. There are also, for example, concerns about education inequities. Virginia’s Fairfax County Public Schools district, which is just outside Washington, D.C., shared a message for parents online in early August, writing that while “families have an absolute right to work together and pool resources to provide instruction or tutoring,” the school system has “concerns that they may widen the gap in educational access and equity for all students. … Many parents cannot afford private instruction,” the message says. “Many working families can’t provide transportation to and from a tutoring pod, even if they could afford to pay for the service.”

Rates for pods can vary, depending on the setup of the pod and where it’s located. “It is truly all over the map,” Horn says. “If you put together a pod of many students, you might be able to get the price down to, say, $10 to $15 an hour. I don’t know that you can get much lower than that.” But, on the high end, Horn says, “pods are costing up to $500 an hour in some cases.”

And if a pod is interested in using additional resources, such as the virtual setups offered by Outschool or the hybrid learning support of a company like Ready to Blend, that costs extra too. Again, prices vary, but one Outschool class can cost more than $100 per learner — with some more complicated classes costing much more.

If you’re on a tight budget and can’t afford any sort of tutor or teacher, Horn says, you may have more options than you think. “A lot of parents are sensitive to the equity gap and are trying to figure out how they can help families who might not have options or dollars to spend,” he says. He recommends looking for Facebook groups focused on your area and seeing what options there are. “Make it known that you want to pod and see what sort of options other families are willing to make,” Horn says. “Maybe you can offer your space for the pod or a day you have off during the week. But from what I’m hearing, parents are delighted to help out a family that needs the help.”

The same may be true of podding organizations. Some companies, like Learning-Pods.com, are offering financial-aid packages for low-income families.

Conversely, if you have income to spare and you are forming a pod, Fisher recommends reaching out to families from a different socioeconomic background to see if they would be interested in joining. “That would make it fair for everyone,” she says. To find families in need of assistance, Fisher says, you can reach out to your child’s school and offer a space in the pod to a family that doesn’t have one — but to understand that not all school districts are supportive of the practice. Alternately, try reaching out to a community organization, or a local church or synagogue, to see who might be in need.

“Don’t assume that parents in different socioeconomic backgrounds aren’t trying to create pods too. They just may not have as many resources,” Horn echoes. He too recommends that families with the means to form pods reach out and include families who aren’t necessarily in the same daily social circle. “Your child would benefit from them being together, and it would help those parents out,” he says. “Maybe they can’t put as much into the pod financially, but maybe they can contribute to the pod in other ways.”

This is where pod learning gets tricky. Again, the concept isn’t easily accessible to everyone. “One of the reasons low-income and minority parents are so adamantly against their children going to school is, of course, the safety concern and that their communities have been burned by the health crisis. But it’s also that they are figuring out childcare solutions so that they don't have to send their children to in-person school,” Horn says. “At the same time, there’s definitely a concern that schools aren’t stepping up to provide high-quality educational options for these families that meets them with their needs and serves and develops the whole child.”

As a result, that “means that low-income parents are at a disadvantage in finding innovative options and are often at the mercy of charitable families, rather than able to proactively choose from among several good options and drive these decisions to create the best fit for them,” Horn says.

But bottom line about school pods? Fisher says that families need to be aware that pod learning takes a lot to figure out and establish and that it could demand trial and effort, and patience. “It’s important for families to give themselves and their children some grace at this time,” she says. “It’s not easy for anybody.”

Polycrub shed.

A WESTER Ross community trust is hoping to set a milestone in a project to create affordable housing after applying for funding applications to acquire new land.

The Applecross Community Company (ACC) has submitted two funding applications to the Scottish Land Fund, which would allow it to buy 5.8 acres of land from the Hydro Field and the Torgarve Woodland, both owned by the Applecross Trust, and put them under community ownership.

The two fund requests, amounting to £156,060 and £163,696 respectively, will allow the company to go ahead with a long-sought affordable housing project and the creation of a community woodland.

ACC local development officer, Roslyn Clarke, said: “There is a real momentum about Applecross at the moment and the community engagement is the key.

“We really hope to get this funding, it’s been so long coming for the community company to buy land for affordable housing projects and we really hope that the effort behind it will be rewarded.”

The purchase of the Hydro Field would aims to provide eight affordable housing units as well as two workshop spaces and community allotments, and is part of the strategy to would address the significant shortage of housing in Applecross.

The ownership of Torgarve Woods, which was offered in 2018 by the Applecross Trust, would include the introduction of evergreen and native tree species in the forest, as the ones currently present are at risk of windfall and would need to be clear-felled.

Local development officer for ACC, Saara Viitanen, said: “We conducted a feasibility study last winter with our Community Woodland Group and the help of the Community Woodland Association to look into different options of how we could use the forest. The conclusion was that the community wanted to use it for educational purposes, involving the local school, creating signs for visitors and highlighting the archaeological heritage features within the forest.

“This project engaged members of the community who work in forestry as well as those who are very passionate about trees and plants and will create a local job for a woodland manager to manage the community projects and the woodlands after the clear-felling.

“It’s a really exciting time for us. We have been really lucky to secure a lot of funding for our projects recently but this has been the effort not only of us but of people that may have been involved years ago and some that have left the community since.”

Archie MacLellan, Applecross Trust executive administrator, said: “The Applecross Trust is committed to working in partnership with the Applecross Community Company and to facilitate and engage in opportunity for sustainable community development. The Trust is the guardian of much of the landscape on the peninsula. It is our priority to ensure that this landscape and the people within it continue to thrive and grow. We want to see an Applecross where people can sustainably live and work. Providing this land for community use helps to achieve that goal and we are pleased to be a part of it.”

“We really hope to get this funding, it’s been so long coming for the community company to buy land for affordable housing projects and we really hope that the effort behind it will be rewarded.”- Roslyn Clark

Ms Clark added: “We have a lot of different projects going on, but they are all linked. Reducing our carbon footprint, protecting the woodland, introducing more opportunities and social and health benefits for the local community and supporting the creation of affordable housing, these all aim to create a sustainable community.”

Only two weeks ago, the trust was awarded almost £310,000 of funding to go towards the construction of three affordable houses in Camusterrach for people with accessibility needs, and is now developing a community allotments scheme - Appleseed - with a new polytunnel and a shed close to completion.

Achieving long and full lashes often requires a trip to the aesthetician, or at the very least a stop at the drugstore for a pair of faux eyelashes and mascara.

While those certainly get the job done, you can end up stunting the hair growth of your natural eyelashes with overuse, which only continues the cycle of reaching for falsies in order to get a dramatic eye look.

Instead of faking it, the other alternative is to strengthen and lengthen your natural lashes with the help of an eyelash serum. If you’re looking to give one a try, one bestselling serum is conveniently available to shop on Amazon after being sold out for weeks.

What is it?

The Ecla Skin Care Organic Cold Pressed Castor Oil is currently Amazon’s number one best-selling eye treatment, and with reviews from more than 2,500 shoppers, it’s easy to see why.

From just one ingredient (cold pressed castor oil), this multipurpose oil can be used to strengthen and encourage hair growth wherever needed. It can be used for brows, lashes, beards, and on the scalp - basically anywhere you’re looking to promote fuller-looking hair.

Though there’s no proof that castor oil encourages hair grown, studies have shown that it may reverse hair loss due to its high concentration of ricinoleic acid—a type of fatty acid found to fight inflammation.

In order to get the best results, it’s recommended that you consistently use castor oil daily on clean and dry lashes before bed. Apply the oil to lashes by placing a small amount of castor oil onto a cotton swab or brow comb, then gently sweep it into your lash line, making sure that none of the oil gets into your eye. In the morning, simply wash off the castor oil with water or a washcloth, and with a little patience you’ll begin to see longer and stronger lashes.

“This product is very gentle on skin and doesn’t burn my eyes at all compared to other similar products that I’ve tried,” they wrote. “It’s an oil so it’s thicker but I find it easier to apply. My hair and lashes look healthier than before.”

“Ive been using this oil for months now and I've noticed a huge difference in the size of my eyelashes,” shared another. “They are so much longer and fuller than they were...Need to buy another batch soon!”

Some reviewers noted that the oil is on the heavier side and does not fully absorb into skin or hair, which can be a little messy if you’re not cautious when applying it.

“Really enjoying this product. My lashes look healthier and thicker,” noted one reviewer. “It is VERY thick oil, however, and a little will go a long way. I find it a little messy and difficult to apply the right amount, but it does not sting or hurt if you get any in your eye.”

If you’re looking to improve the health of your eyelashes or brows, then adding castor oil into your beauty routine may be one way to achieve fuller locks. This bottle of pure castor oil is an affordable way to test out the trend without breaking the bank. It also comes with four convenient brushes to make application a breeze, making it possible for any level of experience to use.

While it’s not a guaranteed solution to thinning hair, it’s certainly worth testing out if you’re after thicker, fuller brows and lashes.

Three of the five most affordable towns to buy a home in the country are in County Durham, with property prices in top-ranked Shildon coming in at around the £60,000 mark.

In the year to April, the average cost of a home in the UK rose by 2.6 per cent, down from a 3.5 per cent increase in the year to March, new figures from the Land Registry and Office for National Statistics showed today.

Affordable: Top five most affordable towns to buy a property now, according to Zoopla

The average UK house price was £235,000 in April 2020, which is £6,000 higher than a year ago.

As the property market ground to a halt, the Office for National Statistics stopped publishing its house price index, only reviving it today with out-of-date statistics up until April which do not reveal the true toll of the lockdown on the housing sector.

According to figures from Halifax, however, house prices recovered to hit their highest levels on record in July as months of pent-up buyer demand was released and the stamp duty holiday put a shot in the arm of the property market.

Last month, property prices saw an uptick for the first time since the lockdown began, growing by an average of 1.6 per cent after months of decline and stagnation, Halifax said.

Where can you buy an affordable property?

With further large-scale job cuts on the horizon and uncertainty over future income streams mounting, any prospective buyer looking to get on or move up the property ladder will need to ensure they only look at homes they can truly afford.

While searching for a home you can genuinely afford has always been a necessity, with the country now officially in recession, lenders are tightening up their criteria for mortgages and buyers need to choose their purchase locations carefully.

Using house price data spanning over 1,000 towns and average pay packet figures for these locations, it is clear that buyers putting affordability at the forefront of their minds should head north rather than south, Zoopla's latest findings suggest.

Where can you buy? Heading to County Durham for a home could be a safe bet for many

With properties coming in at around the £60,000 mark, Shildon in County Durham has been crowned as the most affordable town in the UK.

'When looking at the average annual income in Shildon, the figure of £28,000 sits at just under half of the £60,000 average property price, giving a price-to-earnings ratio of 2.11, the lowest across the UK', Zoopla said.

Taking into account average property prices and local earnings, Cumnock in East Ayrshire, Scotland, swept into second place on the affordability front, with average house prices at £74,000 and average annual salaries around the £31,000 mark, giving an affordability ratio of 2.39.

In Wales, the most affordable town in which to purchase a home is Ferndale in Rhondda Cynon Taff, with the average property price costing 2.67 times the average salary in the area.

Many of the most affordable towns are situated in the north east and north west regions, making the north of England far more affordable than the south.

Tom Parker, a consumer expert at Zoopla, said: 'With the UK housing market opening up again, we know, now more than ever, that it's important for buyers or potential buyers to know where they can get the most for their money when purchasing a property. With budgets tighter than usual, we want to ensure that buying a property is still attainable - even during these unprecedented times.

'Lockdown has resulted in a shift in the way we work, as more employers are allowing their employees to work from home for the foreseeable - and as a result, our property priorities are changing.

'The desire for greater indoor and outdoor space and fewer people having to commute into the office means that the property field is larger and more achievable than ever before - so make use of the analysis and find out a suitable, but most importantly affordable, location to find your dream home.'

What's been happening to house prices in the last few months?

In May, the Office for National Statistics stopped publishing its monthly house price index, as property transactions came to a standstill amid the Government-enforced lockdown announced in March.

Covering the period only the end of April, the figures, which are based on completed transactions, published for the market by the ONS and Land Registry today are largely obsolete.

Average house prices increased by 2.5 per cent to £251,000 in the year to April in England, by 5 per cent to £169,000 in Wales, 1.6 per cent to £153,000 in Scotland and 3.8 per cent to £141,000 in Northern Ireland, the ONS and Land Registry said.

Old data: House price figures from April 2006 to April 2020 published today

How much? Average property prices by region across the UK according to the ONS

London's average house prices increased by 2.3 per cent to £480,000 in the year to April, meaning it retained its top spot as the most expensive place in the country to buy a home.

More recent figures published by Nationwide and Halifax suggest a firming of house prices in July, driven by a release in pent-up demand and a temporary stamp duty threshold shift.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in July that all housing transactions below half a million pounds would not pay any stamp duty until next spring.

In recent weeks, Halifax reported house prices rose 1.6 per cent month-on-month in July, which was the first increase since February and the largest since December 2019, while Nationwide reported that house prices grew by 1.7 per cent month-on-month in July.

But, some experts remain cautious about the longer-term prospects of a marked recovery in house prices and transactions.

Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club, said: 'Housing market activity may see a further pick-up in the near term providing some support to prices, as a result of the raising of the Stamp Duty threshold, along with the release of some pent-up activity following the easing of lockdown restrictions.'

He added: 'Nevertheless, the EY ITEM Club suspects the upside for the housing market will be limited due to challenging fundamentals for consumers.

'Many people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive Government measures, while others will be concerned that they may still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends.

'Additionally, many incomes have been affected. Consumer confidence is currently still low compared to long-term norms and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come when making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.'

The EY Item Club thinks average property prices could end up being 3 per cent lower at the turn of the year than they are now.","Three of the five most affordable towns to buy a home in the country are in County Durham, with property prices in top-ranked Shildon coming in at around the £60,000 mark.

Security cameras are useful for those who are looking to keep tabs on their house whenever they are away from home like on vacation, at work, or even just running out for a bit. The Blink Mini Indoor HD Smart Security Camera is one option you can use to better secure your house. It is equipped with 1080p resolution recording and viewing during the day and 720p at night. It also has two-way audio recording in case you want to chat with your pets or say hello to anyone in the house. All these features come in at a pretty low price point of US$34.99. Read on for our full review!

Design

Most small free-standing security cameras come in different designs, but with most, you’ll get a stand and a block-like design. This design gives you more free space when it comes to adding things next to it or while hanging on a wall. This is the same design aspect that the Blink Mini takes.

Save Close up of Blink Mini camera lens

While looking head on to the camera, you’ll see the camera lens in the center surrounded by a microphone hole and two sensors. Looking around to the rest of the camera, the sides are completely blank while the back has a port for the Micro-USB charger to attach for powering the Blink Mini security camera.

As for the stand itself, it’s a pretty simple stand with a screw that holds the Blink Mini in place. At the bottom of the stand are some rubber feet that will stop the Blink Mini from moving. For those who are looking to mount this camera to a wall, there are two mounting holes on the stand that will allow you to do so fairly easily. Save Back side of Blink Mini

Ease of Use

Setting up the camera is pretty easy. Once you plug it in, connect it to your Wi-Fi network and finish setting it up through the Blink Home Monitor app. The Blink Mini is then controlled through the Blink application as I’ll cover next.

Even though Blink is an Amazon company, you will need to create a Blink account to use the app. After you’ve created your login, or used your current Blink credentials, choose the Blink Mini camera and either scan the QR code on the back of the device with your phone or enter the serial number in manually. From there it’ll have you name the unit and connect to a wireless connection. Lastly, any updates that have been pushed out will start to update before a successful connection.

Software

After the setup is complete, you’ll be taken to the home page where you’ll be able to view what the camera can see thanks. To do so, select the video icon on the left side of the screen. On the right side, you’ll find a camera icon that will save the current frame as a picture for later viewing. On that same page, you can also arm or disarm the camera. Arming the camera will send a notification when movement has been detected, which you can playback by tapping on the notification or at a later under the next tab indicated by a playback icon.

Save Main screen of Blink application showing options for arming/disarming, check video feed, take a picture, and more.

Through the Blink software, you’re also able to manage your settings in a specific way that you’d like such as seeing what emails were used or changing the current password, choosing which temperature you want, have Dark mode on or off, and more.

Save Camera settings showing Motion Detection, Sensitivity, Clip Length, and more.

Since this is a product by Amazon, it will work with Alexa devices. If you have an Echo Show or a Fire TV, you’ll be able to bring up a live feed of where the camera is placed by using the command “Alexa, show me (camera name) on Echo Show 5 or Fire TV.” You can also say commands like “Alexa, ask Blink to arm (system name)” or “Alexa, ask Blink when my last motion alert was.”

Unfortunately, those who do not have an Echo Show or Fire TV will not be able to view the camera but are able to arm and disarm from any standard Echo unit you may have.

Honestly, the software is pretty basic but in a good way. It’s not complicated to the point where no one will be able to understand where everything is and has pretty much all the options you’d need in a security camera.

Performance

The Blink Mini comes with a 1080p camera and it does a wonderful job displaying great quality video when viewing through the application.

When it comes to the performance of the camera while using the application, it responds normally and doesn’t really show any noticeable lag. Of course, if you’re watching it live, there is a little bit of a delay (about a second or two) before you see any kind of movement. After you see something moving, video plays smoothly. Zooming in and out of the video when watching it is pretty smooth as well.

Overall, the performance is pretty good considering this is a really tiny security camera. I believe most users will be happy with how it works.

Sound/Microphone Quality

The Blink Mini also comes with two-way audio which is decent. It’s not groundbreaking but it works. You’re able to hear people on the other end when they’re in front of the camera or near it and vice versa.

Audio quality is as good as you’ll get it on a small security camera like the Blink Mini. You can hear people talking if you have the volume turned up on the connected device. You can hear their voices pretty clearly but will also notice how low quality the audio is once they speak. That being said, you can understand what is being said it’s just lower quality than you may be used to.

Getting to the microphone quality, this is much better as it’s louder. And I mean loud. If you’re naturally loud, you’ll come off as loud. If you’re quieter you’ll still seem loud through the mic. Everyone will definitely be able to hear you since your voice comes across clearly through the camera.

Price

This mini security camera comes with some pretty simple features but that means it also comes in at an affordable price of US$34.99. On top of that, if you’re interested in getting a 2-pack, Amazon is offering it for US$64.99. Either way, you can’t go wrong on picking one up for the house.

Wrap Up

Overall, the Blink Mini Indoor HD Smart Security Camera is nice to have in your home. It’s small enough to put just about anywhere, has useful features like two-way audio, and can be used in any room that you’re looking to place a security camera in.

The recognition is for an ambitious class project where they make the financial case for clean, renewable, and affordable housing solutions for Monterey.





“For us this project really solidifies the best elements of the MIIS education,” says Panturad who began exploring issues related to affordable housing in Monterey when he wrote a paper exploring what a sustainable dormitory for the Institute might look like for a class with Professor Fernando DePaolis in his first semester. The following semester he teamed up with Garber and Trinh to explore the issue from another angle; this time the inspiration was the rezoning of the Garden Road area in Monterey for residential housing developments. As a study for Professor Gireesh Shrimali’s class the three students teamed up to build a financial model successfully making an economic case for clean, renewable, and affordable housing solutions. “These ambitious and innovative thinkers hope that our current leaders can implement lucrative ways of living and doing business that benefits people, profits, and the planet,” says in the Central Coast Community Energy commendation. The agency was established by local communities to source clean and renewable electricity for Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties and now parts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.

All three students are specializing in Sustainability Management. Garber says working on this project helped him narrow his focus in the field. He is very excited about the prospect of raising public awareness about the financial and social benefits of all-electrification, rooftop solar, and water efficient technologies. “There is a groundswell of local activism, especially here in California, and people are starting to see what is best for the planet and human health can also be the most-sound solution economically.” Panturad adds that these solutions and this way of thinking should be applied to any area of the economy. Trinh notes demands are high for affordable housing, especially for people of color, not only in Monterey, but all of California where cost of living is exceptionally high. This semester she, along with Panturad and Garber, is taking a class on Sustainable Cities with City of Monterey Sustainability Coordinator Ted Terrasas. “It is super exciting to get to work with and learn from people who are experienced in the field and explore these issues further.”

254,http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2020/09/01/creating-a-cleaner-and-more-affordable-power-sector-in-north-carolina/,"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Environmental Defense Fund,Creating a cleaner and more affordable power sector in North Carolina,"For more than a year, dozens of advocates and stakeholders – including the electric utilities – have been working together on North Carolina’s Clean Energy Plan development process, which calls for creating a 21st century energy system that is clean, affordable, reliable and equitable. As discussions have progressed in ongoing working groups to explore policy pathways for climate action and systemic utility regulatory reform of North Carolina’s power sector, we recently learned that over the past several months, the major electric utilities across the southeast have been engaged in a separate dialogue on a proposal to create an automated market for trading among the utilities.

We must not let these conversations distract from real opportunities to achieve Governor Cooper’s ultimate goal of moving North Carolina to a clean energy future. The electric power sector is the largest source of climate-warming pollution in North Carolina, making up 35% of the state’s emissions. Gov Cooper has committed the state to doing its part to address pollution from this sector, and both the state and Duke Energy have set goals to achieve net zero carbon emission from the power sector by 2050.

What we know about the proposed Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM)

According to Duke Energy, the proposed Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) will provide cost savings to customers, increase renewable penetration in the state, and would not limit the opportunity for more robust regulatory reform solutions. Details of this potential automated market remain vague. However, based on the limited information released to date, the SEEM proposal lacks any formal governance structure and appears to be focused primarily on the expansion and automation of a process already in place for these electric utilities to buy and sell electricity from each other. Therefore, it is unclear exactly what consumer benefits will be realized from the multi-million dollar investment in the SEEM and what oversight authority North Carolina regulators will have to ensure those benefits are delivered to North Carolina ratepayers. Absent a significant increase in transparency from the region’s electric utilities, the details, costs, and benefits associated with the SEEM proposal will likely remain unclear. What is already clear, however, is that SEEM alone will be insufficient to deliver the solutions being considered in NC’s ongoing stakeholder processes.

Reform of the state’s more than 100-year-old electric power sector is sorely needed to accommodate the needs of today. Given the escalating costs associated with conventional, polluting energy sources like coal and gas, and the declining costs of renewables like solar, wind and energy storage, it is clear that new incentives for increased investment in and expanded use of clean energy sources must be a pillar of reform as well. Additionally, power sector reform should include incentives and requirements for pollution reductions that serve to drive dirty energy sources to retirement more quickly, while helping the state achieve its emissions reduction goals.

Joining a proven climate initiative

With North Carolina communities increasingly on the frontlines of extreme weather events including catastrophic flooding driven by climate change-fueled hurricanes, it’s time for the state to take concrete actions to limit carbon pollution. Even while state-led stakeholder work proceeds, there is a proven policy option for reducing emissions that North Carolina could implement now that would achieve many of the Clean Energy Plan goals, as well as the objectives Duke Energy has laid out in its climate commitment: North Carolina can put an enforceable limit on power sector carbon pollution and join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). RGGI is a collaboration of ten Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states designed to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector by placing a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions. New Jersey also joined the program in 2020, Virginia will be joining in 2021, and Pennsylvania is poised to initiate a regulatory process that – if completed – would facilitate its collaboration as well.

The RGGI model is rigorous enough to ensure North Carolina delivers crucial pollution reductions but flexible enough to facilitate the most effective ways to achieve them.

By requiring electric utilities to pay for the carbon pollution they emit with a price on carbon, RGGI incentivizes investment in low-carbon and carbon-free energy sources, while also creating financial incentives to remove polluting energy sources more quickly. Specifically, RGGI’s flexible “cap-and-invest” framework works by placing a cap on total power sector carbon emissions from participating states to limit pollution; that cap decreases over time to drive emission reductions at power plants in each participating state. Companies buy and sell allowances that let them emit a certain amount under the predetermined cap as supply and demand set the price of an allowance. This gives companies a strong incentive to save money by cutting emissions in the most cost-effective ways, which minimizes costs for consumers. And importantly, RGGI has proven compatible with a variety of approaches for electricity markets in its different states.

This framework has a track record of success. Since 2009, RGGI states have reduced power plant carbon emissions by 47%, which outpaces other states’ reductions over the same time. RGGI has also created significant health benefits by reducing co-pollutant emissions of particulate matter, air toxics, and ground level ozone, which all have adverse health impacts on the people of North Carolina. In fact, a recent study from the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health found that between 2009 and 2014, air quality improvements from RGGI created an estimated $191 million and $350 million in cost savings.

As more states begin taking steps to join this alliance working together to reduce emissions, North Carolina should do the same, ensuring that as conversations continue to unfold regarding electric power sector reform, there is absolute clarity around the industry’s emission reduction trajectory. Such a framework will help ensure the delivery of a healthier, more affordable, cleaner energy system. Plus, polling shows that the majority of North Carolina voters support new policies to reduce climate pollution.

In the last century, policymakers crafted rules for an electric power sector that transformed our economy and improved the quality of life for countless North Carolinians. There is no question that our state’s energy markets need reform, and it’s up to us to ensure that any new model is designed in a way that serves the interests of North Carolinians – not just the utilities and their shareholders. Today, North Carolina has a similar opportunity – as we did in the last century – to reach for a better future. Let’s make sure that no matter what approach regulatory reform takes, North Carolina is not leaving pollution outcomes up to chance or leaving the most effective tool on the shelf.

Four SFU alumni entrepreneurs are giving used electric vehicle batteries a second life by converting them to clean-energy storage units that can help remote communities inexpensively transition to renewable energy.

The increasing global demand for electric vehicles means more electric vehicle batteries will be disposed in the landfill unless they are repurposed.

Entrepreneurs Sumreen Rattan, Gurmesh Sidhu, Gabriel Soares, and Edward Chiang saw an opportunity to solve the problem using their knowledge as graduates of the Faculty of Applied Sciences.

Coupling their education with their passion for clean tech, they established Moment Energy in 2019. The company builds custom energy-storage units by modifying the electronic and mechanical components of used electric vehicle batteries.

Moment Energy’s repurposed batteries harvest renewable energy when it is being produced. This allows users to overcome the challenge of intermittent renewable energy. For example, solar energy cannot be generated when there is no sunshine. The energy storage units solve this problem by storing renewable energy for users to access at any time.

This September, Moment Energy secured a supply chain with Nissan North America for used electric vehicle batteries. The first shipment arrives at the end of September.

“This puts us on the road to efficiently deliver renewable energy to remote communities and also prevent usable batteries from producing toxic waste in landfills,” says company co-founder Sumreen Rattan. She notes that repurposed batteries are more environmentally friendly than traditional energy storage options, which are costly and deplete raw materials.

Mark Thorpe, director, business planning and development aftersales, Nissan North America, says, “Moment Energy is proving that second-life Nissan LEAF batteries can continue to have value beyond the vehicle.”

Moment Energy receives entrepreneurship support from SFU’s Coast Capital Savings Venture Connection, an early-stage business incubator for SFU students, alumni, faculty and staff who are pursuing entrepreneurial ventures. Moment Energy’s mentor, Douglas Fast, has been coaching the team since 2019.

Company co-founder Gabriel Soares says, “Venture Connection provided us with the mentorship and support we needed to get on our feet. Our weekly meetings with Doug helped us to truly leverage the skillset of our team and to reflect on what entrepreneurship means to us.”

Their entrepreneurial goal, says Soares, is to leave a positive impact on the world.","By Vivien LeeFour SFU alumni entrepreneurs are giving used electric vehicle batteries a second life by converting them to clean-energy storage units that can help remote communities inexpensively transition to renewable energy.

Building on the achievement of previous World Bank support to the energy sector, the Rwanda Energy Access and Quality Improvement Project (EAQIP) will advance Rwanda’s progress towards achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, while also contributing to the country’s aim of reducing reliance on cooking fuel by 50%.

“The proposed project is well-timed to build on the World Bank’s decade-long support to the Government’s energy sector agenda. It will contribute directly to Rwanda’s push toward universal energy access by 2024 and universal access to clean cooking by 2030”, said Rolande Pryce, World Bank Country Manager for Rwanda. “We are honored to be a long-term partner in this journey.”

Rwanda EAQIP aims to improve electricity access by providing funding for the country’s ongoing program of expanding grid connections for residential, commercial, industrial, and public sector consumers, as well as by providing grants to reduce the costs of off-grid solar home systems. The project will also enhance the availability and efficiency of low-cost renewable energy by restoring capacity at the Ntaruka Hydro-Power Project, reducing voltage fluctuations on transmission lines, and supporting the national smart meter program.

The project includes the World Bank’s largest clean cooking operation in Africa, and the first project co-financed by the recently launched Clean Cooking Fund (CCF), hosted by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The CCF will provide $20 million for clean cooking, with $10 million provided as a grant and $10million extended as a loan. The project targets 2.15 million people, leveraging an additional US$30 million in public and private sector investments. By incentivizing the private sector and improving the enabling environment, the project aims to develop a sustainable market for affordable clean cooking solutions in Rwanda.

The project is part of the Rwanda Universal Energy Access Program (RUEAP), which coordinates the efforts of development partners supporting the energy sector to contribute to the achievement of the targets set out in the National Strategy for Transformation (2017-24).

“The World Bank is proud to have led the RUEAP on behalf of the development partners, including the French Development Agency (co-financing the EAQIP). The World Bank looks forward to supporting the implementation of the ongoing program and expects to report positive outcomes in the lives of Rwandans” said Norah Kipwola, World Bank Senior Energy Specialist and the project Task Team Leader.","“The proposed project is well-timed to build on the World Bank’s decade-long support to the Government’s energy sector agenda.

In addition, its cost competitiveness and ability to expand into new markets is driving investments in Maryland communities at a time when they are greatly needed.

Community solar is distinctive for its simplicity and flexibility – it allows utility customers who are unable to access the benefits of onsite solar otherwise the option to purchase renewable energy from a local community solar project.

“Allegany County is proud to have an innovative energy project that brings investment as well as long term tax revenue to the local economy for years to come,” said Jake Shade, President of the Allegany County Board of Commissioners.

Standard Solar, Inc., a leading solar energy company specializing in the development, funding and operations of solar electric systems nationwide, is bringing more than 8,000,000 kWh of annual energy supply to Maryland community solar subscribers, in partnership with Ogos Energy LLC, Earth and Air Technologies and Neighborhood Sun.

The two projects, a combined 5.5 megawatts (MW), are expected to provide savings and clean power to approximately 800 Maryland households as subscribers.

“Community solar is an effective way to provide large numbers of subscribers access to the benefits of clean energy,” said John Finnerty, Director of Business Development, Standard Solar. “Community solar projects engage a community, starting with ratepayers interested in savings and clean energy, a land owner to provide or host the site, a servicing utility to approve the grid interconnection, efficient state regulators providing consumer protections and grants and a team of solar project engineers and system operators. Collectively, the community wins and ratepayers save. We’re particularly excited to own and operate these projects in our home state of Maryland where we’ve funded more than 35 MW of clean energy in the state.”

“These projects will bring direct financial benefits to hundreds of residents of western Maryland while also cleaning our air and helping fight climate change,” noted Gary Skulnik, CEO of Neighborhood Sun. “Together with Standard Solar and the others involved in the projects, we’re proud to be helping improve life in our home state.”

Standard Solar financed and will own and operate the community solar farms. The Flintstone Community Solar project, located in Allegany County Maryland, and the Shepherd’s Mill Community Solar project in Carroll County Maryland are both under construction and are actively being subscribed.

The projects received grant funding from the Maryland Energy Administration’s (MEA) FY20 Community Solar LMI PPA Incentive Grant Program (LMI-PPA Program) designed to help extend the benefits of community solar projects to members of the Low and Moderate Income (LMI) community. LMI subscribers are guaranteed additional discounts on the community solar portion of their electric bill. All other residential customers are guaranteed to save 10% annually by switching to community solar power.

The whitepaper aims to create a productive dialogue with state leaders to discuss how New Jersey can use energy infrastructure investment to kickstart our economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession and keep energy costs manageable for residents in the long term.

With environmental groups advocating for policy that would completely do away with affordable energy sources, such as clean natural gas, AENJ is aiming to debunk the myths and show state leaders and residents that we cannot rely solely on sources like solar and wind, and clean natural gas must be a part of our energy mix in the future.

""Affordable, reliable energy investments are essential for New Jersey's economic recovery plan, and right now state policy misses the mark,"" said AENJ Executive Director Ron Morano. ""This document is meant to be a roadmap for policymakers, highlighting that investing in our energy infrastructure gives our economy the boost it needs, while keeping energy costs affordable for all.""

Energizing Our Economy evaluates the current energy policy based on the administration's proposals made before the impacts of COVID-19; it also highlights changes that need to be made post-COVID-19 to keep our economy afloat. As it stands, the administration's energy policies – including the Energy Master Plan – will result in higher costs for residents and businesses and worse reliability. Throughout its analysis, the whitepaper takes a deep dive into the cost debate taking place throughout our state as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and outlines the steps and policy changes we must make to avoid high energy costs becoming a large part of the problem.

""Now more than ever it is critical to invest in our energy systems to create jobs and spur our economy,"" Morano added. ""Ensuring we have a diverse energy portfolio will decrease volatility and increase supply, both of which lower costs for all of us.""

But the bad news was potentially all-eclipsing. The world, by the consultancy’s calculations in its Energy Transition Outlook 2020 report, is heading towards a temperature rise 2.3°C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century, far beyond the “well below 2°C” targeted in the 2015 Paris Agreement, and pointing to catastrophic consequences for the planet.

“In the space of a single generation, we will see dramatic shifts in energy supply and demand with the energy mix split into equal shares between fossil and non-fossil sources by the middle of the century,” said DNV GL chief executive Remi Eriksen in a media briefing. “And there will be a doubling of electrification and enormous efficiency gains.

“But even so, decarbonisation is not happening fast enough to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.”

The report highlights that global energy demand will fall by 8% this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with a long-term impact on air travel and commuting. Yet to hit the Paris Agreement’s preferred 1.5°C limit, the world would “need to make the same level of emissions reductions that we have seen in this pandemic every year from now until 2050”, said Eriksen.

His colleague Ditlev Engel, the former Vestas boss who now heads DNV GL’s energy unit, tells Recharge: “[Due to Covid] we have already stopped flying, for the most part; we’ve stopped driving to the office and so on… so this was the ‘easy’ 8%. What are we going to do to get that 8% [reduction in energy demand and the associated emissions reductions] next year and the year after that?”

However, the report says that “compliance with the Paris Agreement is entirely feasible within energy’s current share of global GDP [gross domestic product]”.

[There will be] plentiful opportunities for those who master the wave of the energy transition.

The study authors, led by Sverre Alvik, stress: “We urgently need to find more sustainable and lasting ways to reduce emissions. Some subsectors are well under way, like wind, solar PV and EVs; but we must also urgently tackle those areas, like heavy industry and long-distance transport, where emissions are hard to abate.

“Tough business and policy choices lie ahead, but also plentiful opportunities for those who master the wave of the energy transition.”

Green growth flourishes

DNV GL expects variable renewable energy sources (vRES) — that is, wind and solar and related technologies such as batteries — to “gradually, but steadily, transition from being marginal to becoming the dominant electricity sources in 2050”.

“By then, 78% of the world’s electricity will be generated from renewable sources [up from 26% in 2018], and 62% alone from vRES. In 2050, fossil fuels will generate only 17% of power needs, and nuclear only 5%,” says the report.

“From 2018 to 2050, PV capacity will grow 20-fold, reaching 10TW just before 2050, while, installed wind capacity will increase ten-fold to 4.9TW for onshore, 1TW for fixed offshore and 260GW for floating offshore wind.”

Asia will be key to the global energy transition, Eriksen pointed out, telling journalists: “If India and China do not decarbonise, then it doesn’t really matter what the rest of the world is doing.”

Technology to the rescue

Engel tells Recharge that emerging technologies such as bifacial solar modules, still larger nameplate wind turbines, floating wind and floating solar will play an increasingly significant role in accelerating the global energy system’s transformation over the next five years.

“The combination of these innovations with smarter management and analysis of data, increasing uptake of digital technologies and intelligent control to maximise the capture price, will lead to more efficient and cost-effective wind and solar power plants, which should make investment opportunities even more attractive,” he says.

“With the addition of new energy storage solutions, including hydrogen, a clean and reliable energy system will arise.”

As the report spells out: “The power market will become more complex as dispatchable, non-dispatchable and storage compete as sources of supply.”

Storage capacity will grow from 650GWh today to more than 30TWh by 2030, with a major role for electric vehicles: “Through vehicle-to-grid networks, we expect 10% of the global EV fleet’s storage capacity to be available for grid flexibility at any time.”

The costs of EV batteries will fall by 85% by 2050, according to DNV GL forecasts, contributing to the gradual demise of the internal combustion engine (ICE) passenger vehicle market.

Global electricity demand will grow from 27 petawatt hours (PWh) today to 60PWh by mid-century due to economic growth and electrification of heat and transport, with grid capacity growing by 170%.

Yet despite the massive increase in demand for clean electricity, fossil fuels will still provide 54% of primary energy by mid-century — down from 80% today.

“If we are serious about truly accelerating the pace, we urgently need higher carbon pricing, renewable technology rapidly deployed at scale, expanded digitalised global grid infrastructure, and greater energy-efficiency measures,” Engel tells Recharge.

He adds that one of the main bottlenecks preventing a faster energy transition is slow and efficient regulatory frameworks for approving renewables and low-carbon projects.

“The regulatory aspect is where we need to see a revolution in the coming years,” Engel says. “Because you can’t scale up as fast as you need to the way it is operating today.

“We have not seen any governments start any [fast-track] implementation programmes on permitting — this is something within our boundaries that we should be able to fix.”

Will hydrogen step on the gas?

While spotlighting that green hydrogen – generated from renewables sources – can decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors where electrification will not suffice — such as high-temperature industrial heat and long-distance commercial transport — the DNV GL ETO report does not anticipate a clean-hydrogen market taking off until 2035.

Blue hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage “will not start in earnest until after 2035”, the report says.

And green hydrogen derived from surplus renewables via water electrolysis is not expected “to any great degree before 2035… [as] there are a range of other uses for such surpluses, not least various forms of storage for grid flexibility”, it adds.

“After a slow start, increasing carbon prices and a self-reinforcing reduction in technology costs will have more effect from 2035 and, from then on, we will see the start of a more rapid hydrogen uptake.

“Both supply chains [ie, green and blue hydrogen] will continue to grow through to 2050, and, by then, electrolysis will supply slightly over half of the 23 EJ/yr of hydrogen [just above 5% of the global energy mix].”

Fossils under pressure

DNV GL’s report shows that the central role of the oil & gas industry in the global energy economy is set to significantly diminish over the coming 30 years, falling from 77% of total energy expenditure today to 44% by 2050, with the upstream sector in particular in for a rude awakening.

“Most of the upstream fossil-fuel expenditure will disappear due to oil capex falling by a factor of nine from today to mid-century,” the report says, adding that natural-gas capex will fall by just over 25% over the same period.

Little wonder then that supermajors such as BP, Shell and Total are increasingly moving into the clean power sector.

“Pressure is increasing on the oil & gas industry to decarbonise and this is coming from all sides: from society and governments, from investors and also from people within the industry itself,” said DNV GL Oil & Gas chief executive Liv Hovem.

“We see the sector increasingly putting the energy transition at the centre of its agenda but climate change and ambitions to reduce it are outpacing action. The industry needs to prepare for an energy system that does not accept the release of carbon emissions.”

Engel adds: “Our impression is that financial department in these [oil & gas] companies are saying the delta between the return on capital employed on a renewables project and a fossil fuel project has now become much closer and moving to act invest accordingly.”

The report points out that carbon capture and storage (CCS) can help to reduce emissions, it will not play the kind of primary role that many in the oil & gas sector might be pinning its hopes on.

“While decarbonising oil is virtually impossible, gas can be decarbonised through carbon capture either when producing ‘blue’ hydrogen or post-combustion in power plants or industry,” said Hovem.

“However, decarbonization of gas will not start in earnest until after 2035 and, even then, will be quite slow, with just 13% of natural gas effectively decarbonized by 2050.”

Only 11% of global energy emissions will be captured by CCS — mostly from natural gas — by mid-century, it adds.

Natural gas is expected to overtake oil in the primary energy mix in 2026 and gas demand is forecast to peak in 2035 before its utilisation slowly tapers off.

Transition ‘affordable and feasible’

One of the key takeaways from the report is DNV GL’s conclusion that the global energy transition will not only be affordable, but actually halve the share of GDP devoted to energy expenditure.

“We conclude that the energy transition that we forecast is, indeed, affordable, and that compliance with the Paris Agreement is entirely feasible within energy’s current share of global GDP.

“While world GDP will more than double by 2050, the share of GDP devoted to energy expenditure will halve, dropping from its current level of 3% to 1.6% by mid-century. These expenditures include major expansions in high capital-cost renewables and electricity networks.”

The study explains that global energy expenditure will only rise by 5% — from $4.2trn in 2018 to $4.4trn in 2050 — at the same time as global GDP doubles.

“[If] you look at it from a ministry of finance point of view, you can safely say you are going to continually spend less of your GDP building power capacity — even if it looks like a lot of money right now in real terms,” Engel tells Recharge. “But the message is clear: in balancing your budget, don’t worry that you’ll be spending a larger proportion of your GDP on energy. It is quite the opposite.”

Additional reporting by Amanda Battersby","[There will be] plentiful opportunities for those who master the wave of the energy transition.
He adds that one of the main bottlenecks preventing a faster energy transition is slow and efficient regulatory frameworks for approving renewables and low-carbon projects.
“We see the sector increasingly putting the energy transition at the centre of its agenda but climate change and ambitions to reduce it are outpacing action.

Inspired by the honeycomb-like structure of butterfly wings, the team built a porous, nanoscale architecture into which catalytic nanoparticles can be precisely embedded to maximize their exposure to polluted air. The result is a highly efficient catalytic system that needs minimal materials to clean air.

Based on fundamental research conducted at SEAS, the technology was refined, optimized, and shepherded by the Wyss Institute through a de-risking and validation process in preparation for commercialization. The technology is covered by several pending patent applications and an issued patent, and is described in papers recently published in Advanced Functional Materials and Catalysis Today.

“Catalytic converters have been used for decades to remove pollutants from factory smokestacks and cars, but they have never been used for indoor air purification because they are expensive, require high temperatures and controlled operating conditions to work well, and are vulnerable to loss of activity over time,” said Tanya Shirman, now VP of Material Design at Metalmark. “Now that smaller indoor air particles have been linked to heart attacks, pulmonary diseases, neurological disorders, and even cancer, it is clear that the problem of air purification needs to be addressed. Metalmark aims to provide a unique solution that overcomes the challenges of indoor air purification and avoids the shortcomings of traditional catalysts.”

The company has completed a pre-seed round of funding and is currently raising its seed round. It was also awarded research grants from the NSF and NIH, and has signed contracts with major multinational corporate customers. Its current prototype has been designed to integrate with the equipment currently used for air handling in buildings, and Metalmark plans to deploy it in real-world environments in the near future.

“Removing specific pollutants from smokestack or car exhaust is pretty straightforward and our technology offers significant advantages for those applications. Indoor air is much more complex, but our lab tests have been excellent and we now intend to prove that our system works similarly well in uncontrolled environments,” said Elijah Shirman, who is now VP of Technology at Metalmark.

Following validation that its system can successfully remove VOCs, aerosols, and live viruses from indoor air, Metalmark’s long-term plan includes expanding its scope to produce multifunctional coatings and other catalytic materials to not only reduce emissions from factories and vehicles, but also perform chemical transformations, such as converting the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into useable materials.

“This powerful platform is a rare example of a technology that is highly customizable, can reduce cost, save rare metals, operate at benign conditions, save energy, improve the environment and human health, and provide a sorely needed service that was previously impossible, all at the same time,” said Joanna Aizenberg.","The result is a highly efficient catalytic system that needs minimal materials to clean air.

Cuomo today announced that 645 Main Street, a new $51 million housing development with 82 energy-efficient apartments, has begun construction in Peekskill, Westchester County. The new affordable complex is reserved for households earning 40 to 80 percent of the area median income, helping to meet the city's winning Downtown Revitalization Initiative goal of providing a greater array of housing choice. The 645 Main Street development is part of Governor Cuomo's unprecedented $20 billion, five-year affordable Housing Plan administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal.

""Every New Yorker deserves a safe, decent and affordable place to call home,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""This new, energy-efficient development builds upon our continued strategic investments in downtowns throughout the state and will provide more than 80 brand-new, affordable apartments for families and the community.""

""We are committed to continuing to invest in our communities to help ensure growth and improve quality of life for all New Yorkers, and that includes creating and preserving affordable housing opportunities,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. ""The start of construction on a new $51 million affordable, multi-family housing development in Peekskill is another sign of this commitment and that New York's better days are ahead. We are leading the way forward for a post-pandemic world by building back better, stronger and more inclusive than ever before.""

New York State's $20 billion plan reflects a commitment to providing all New Yorkers with access to safe, affordable housing, making housing more accessible and combatting homelessness by building and preserving more than 100,000 affordable apartments and 6,000 units of supportive housing. The development is within the city of Peekskill's Downtown Revitalization Initiative area and complements the Initiative's goal of providing more diverse housing options.



When complete, 645 Main Street will host 18 one-bedroom apartments, 50 two-bedroom apartments and 14 three-bedroom apartments. There will be one apartment for the property superintendent. Amenities for residents include a landscaped courtyard, community room with kitchen, fitness center, laundry room, and an on-site management office. All apartments will have Energy Star appliances and individually-controlled heat and electric. The five-story development will be built on a two-acre remediated Brownfield site within Peekskill's DRI area. It includes a 140-space parking garage that will feature a green roof with underground stormwater infiltration system that will retain surface water onsite to reduce the burden on the municipal system. Photovoltaic solar panels placed on the roof will offset energy costs. Other energy efficiency measures will include high-performance building envelope and heating and cooling conditioning systems, and low-flow plumbing fixtures. Rents are set to be affordable to individuals and households with incomes ranging from 40 to 80 percent or less of the Area Median Income. The developer is Wilder Balter Partners Inc. and the architect is L&M Design Inc.

HCR's investment in 645 Main Street includes $21.9 million in construction and permanent tax-exempt Climate bonds, $12.1 million in federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity and nearly $12.3 million in subsidy. Other State funding includes Brownfield Cleanup Program Syndication Proceeds in the amount of nearly $6 million from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and more than $270,000 through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority's Low-rise Residential New Construction program. The Westchester County Housing Implementation Fund and the Westchester County New Homes Land Acquisition Fund provided $5.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

645 Main Street is certified by the international Climate Bonds Initiative, which helps finance the construction of healthy, energy-efficient homes for New Yorkers while reducing the State's carbon footprint.

Since 2011, HCR has invested more than $1 billion in 130 developments to create or preserve nearly 13,000 affordable homes and apartments in the Mid-Hudson Region, including nearly $800 million in Westchester County to support nearly 7,500 homes for more than 20,000 people. The State investment has leveraged nearly $1.9 billion in other funds for these Mid-Hudson Region developments.

HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, ""Creating great homes that are affordable to working New Yorkers is HCR's central mission. Getting that done while helping to reinvigorate a growing downtown area, like Peekskill, checks all those boxes and more. The 645 Main Street complex will help build a more diverse and healthy community in Peekskill and provide 82 units of affordable housing that hard-working New Yorkers need and deserve. We are proud that the Governor Cuomo's housing plan commitment is making a real difference in boosting our economic recovery in the wake of this devastating pandemic.""

Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Basil Seggos said, ""New York's Brownfield Cleanup Program is advancing the cleanup of former industrial sites in communities across the state and putting hundreds of underutilized properties back into productive use. The cleanup and restoration of brownfield properties like the former Charcoal Tablet Mill site is critical to safeguarding public health, protecting the environment, and developing community assets. This project will bring critically needed affordable housing opportunities to Main Street in Peekskill, which will energize the local economy and improve quality of life.""

Doreen M. Harris, Acting President and CEO, NYSERDA said, ""Robust projects like these, which transition underutilized former industrial sites into safe, comfortable and affordable housing that includes clean, renewable energy and energy efficient technologies are at the core of Governor Cuomo's vision for an equitable clean energy transition that all New Yorkers can participate in. As we continue combatting the effects of a changing climate, NYSERDA looks forward to working with communities, stakeholders and our sister agencies to bring more projects like this to fruition, helping to foster cleaner, greener communities across the state.""

New York Secretary of State Rossana Rosado said, ""It is exciting to celebrate the start of this affordable housing project on a former brownfield site in the City of Peekskill. This will provide residents with an array of robust housing choices and marks another step forward in the state's partnership with Peekskill to revitalize the city's downtown and spur investment. I commend all who have worked hard to achieve this milestone, and DOS looks forward to continuing to work with our agency partners and Peekskill to advance the community's revitalization goals through the Downtown Revitalization Initiative.""

Senator Peter Harckham said, ""Thanks to a successful partnership between a visionary developer and supportive state, county and city officials, the pressing need for fair and affordable housing in Westchester is being addressed here in an inclusive manner. This groundbreaking is the culmination of a great deal of planning, inventiveness and cooperation. It also highlights Bill Balter's strong commitment to development projects that meet community needs and respect community values.""

Assemblywoman Sandy Galef said, ""My kudos go out to the City of Peekskill for all of their work advancing affordable housing.

Westchester County Executive George Latimer said, ""Affordable housing has long been one of the top priorities of my administration because it ultimately contributes to better-rounded, more vibrant communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous financial strain, especially for those with low and moderate incomes, and I am thrilled that New York State Homes and Community Renewal is breaking ground on this $50.8 million dollar development that will provide more than 80 units of essential workforce housing for Peekskill.""

Peekskill Mayor Andre Rainey said, ""There are few things more impactful and important to the future health of a city than truly affordable housing. Still, 645 Main Street is more than a valuable new asset for Peekskill, it contributes to furthering our collaborative, visionary Downtown Revitalization Initiative Plan and secures our legacy as a community that cares and provides for the needs of all of our hardworking residents. Thank you to Governor Cuomo and our many partners on this exciting new development.""

William Balter, President of Wilder Balter Partners, Inc., said, ""645 Main is a result of a collaborative public private relationship between WBP and our development team, local stakeholders, the City of Peekskill, Westchester County and NY State HCR. We could not be more pleased to be able to provide this needed affordable and workforce housing in such a walkable location in the downtown of the City of Peekskill.""

About the Downtown Revitalization Initiative

In 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo launched a major new initiative—the Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI). Through the DRI, the Governor moved to aggressively accelerate and expand the revitalization of downtowns and neighborhood to serve as centers of activity and catalysts for investment in all ten regions of the state. The DRI represents an unprecedented and innovative plan-to-act strategy that couples strategic planning with immediate implementation.



In the first four years of the DRI, the State has committed $400 million to invest in downtowns that are ripe for revitalization and have the potential to become magnets for redevelopment, business, job creation, greater economic and housing diversity, and opportunity. Participating communities are nominated by the state's ten Regional Economic Development Councils based on the downtown's potential for transformation, and each community is awarded $10 million to develop a downtown strategic investment plan and implement key catalytic projects that advance the community's vision for revitalization. The DRI is chaired by New York Secretary of State Rossana Rosado. Communities receive support from private sector experts and a team of state agency staff led by the Department of State in close partnership with Empire State Development, and NYS Homes and Community Renewal. Other agencies are also involved in reviewing and implementing projects.

Peekskill was selected as the Round Four winner of the $10 million Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) award in the Mid-Hudson region, inviting people to ""Take a Peek ...Discover Peekskill!"" Its DRI target area includes the downtown and waterfront Transit-Oriented Development District which boasts cultural and educational institutions, an award-winning waterfront and parks system, and a core string of restaurants and boutique retailers.

About the Brownfield Cleanup Program

DEC strictly oversees the State's BCP, which has successfully cleaned up an estimated 456 formerly contaminated properties statewide to protect public health and the environment and return these sites to productive use. The goal of the program is to encourage private-sector cleanups of brownfields and to promote their redevelopment as a means to revitalize communities. The BCP is an alternative to greenfield development and is intended to remove some of the barriers to, and provide tax incentives for, the redevelopment of urban brownfields. Since its inception, 827 applications to the BCP have been approved, and to date 456 sites have been issued Certificates of Completion.

Power demand growth forecasts made under Integrated Generation Capacity Enhancement Plan-2047 (IGCEP-2047) are too high and do not take into account the impact of COVID-19, states the study conducted by Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and launched through a webinar held under the auspices of Alliance for Climate Justice an Clean Energy (ACJCE).

Owing to the IGCEP’s over-optimistic power demand growth, more power capacity than needed is planned to be built, warns the study titled as ‘Pakistan risks locking into overcapacity and expensive power’.

“The Pakistan government’s principle of affordability cannot be met if the power system is locked into long-term overcapacity – capacity payments to plants lying idle are already an issue and would become even more unsustainable if more overcapacity is locked in,” said Simon Nicholas, author of the study.

Notwithstanding the fact that wind and solar were already the cheapest source of power generation in Pakistan and would be even cheaper in the 2030s and 2040s, he said, the IGCEP had neglected modern clean energy in its model after 2030.

Modelling declining contribution from renewables post-2030, the IGCEP-2047 seemed to have been oblivious to current power trends, he said. With utilization at virtually zero by 2047, the addition of 20,000MW of unneeded LNG-fired power capacity between 2030 and 2047, as modelled under IGCEP-2047, would prove to be expensive stranded assets.

Terming indiginization of power through domestic coal-fired power as expensive, he said, renewable energy could reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports far more cheaply than coal power. By prioritizing expensive coal power over the cheap renewables, he said, the IGCEP further failed to live up to the government’s affordability principle.

Besides, the large amounts of domestic coal power to be introduced under IGCEP-2047 would also lead to a significant increase, not decrease, in the overall carbon emissions of Pakistan’s power system, he said while adding that the IGCEP failed the government’s sustainability principle as well as one of its stated goals of reduced carbon emissions.

Following the author’s presentation on the ‘key findings of the study’, a panel discussion started at the webinar.

Haneea Isaad of Rural Development Policy Institute (RDPI) questioned the methodology used in IGCEP-2047 for defining least cost generation option and underlined the need to overhaul the modelling approach used for its development.

She said the cost-benefit analysis made for IGCEP-2047 didn’t take into account costs of auxiliary services such as transmission or water infrastructure that would be constructed to run power plants in Thar.

Nor did the Pakistan’s long-term power capacity plan give any substantial consideration to better storage options to be available in future, the country’s international environmental commitments and emission reduction targets.","KARACHI (Dunya News) – A study launched on Thursday has revealed that Pakistan’s new long-term power capacity plan has failed to live up to the government’s stated principles of sustainability and affordability.

Minister of Energy, Newton Kambala said the country was failing to develop as foreign companies fail to invest in the country because of power shortage and corruption among other things.

He was speaking on Thursday, when he toured Ruo-Ndiza and Muloza Power Stations in Mulanje which are managed by Mulanje Hydro Limited and Cedar Energy Limited respectively.

""This is why we are at Ruo-Ndiza power station to see how best we can improve on this so that the number of Malawians with access to affordable and reliable electricity rises from 10 percent to 30 percent,"" Kambala said, adding that this would attract investors and bring lot of transformation development wise.

He expressed worry that out of the 10 investors that have shown interest in the energy sector in recent years, only three are eager to progress.

""The rest have not done anything since their contacts were awarded and let me warn that if nothing is done in the coming two months we will have to invoke their licenses because Malawians cannot keep waiting for long,"" the Minister said while commending Mulanje Hydro Limited for generating power while pointing out areas that needs improvement.

""We noted that we don't have enough water flow which is affecting your power generation capacity as lm told the design of the power station is 8.2 megawatts but currently you are doing less than one megawatt which is a huge setback,"" he said, while suggesting the need for the plant to have a water reservoir.

""As an engineer, I would like to see Malawians access affordable source of energy. In other countries they pay as low as five cents per Kilowatt/hour where in the country, we pay up to 13 cents that's why as the Energy Minister l will make sure the country is moving towards that,"" he added.

Kambala said there was need to diversify in terms of energy sources as one way of reducing costs of energy in the country.

He appealed to consumers to consider using Liquidized Petroleum Gas (LPG) for cooking instead of always using electricity and if the use of LPGs is increased, we would reduce demand of firewood and charcoal.

The Minister said the competition would bring low prices.

Managing Director for Mulanje Hydro Limited, Ian M'Kersie said despite generating low power in the dry season, the power plant supplies enough electricity to tea processing companies in the district since it became operational nine months ago.

""This time of the year, we have low power and when the rain is back, we have full power. This is a very good match for the tea business because that is when they also need high voltage,"" he said.

One huge challenge for many electric vehicle drivers is home charging. Where will the vehicle charge? How fast will it charge? NeoCharge’s Smart Splitters make adding an EV charger to your home easier and more affordable for many homeowners and renters.

NeoCharge Smart Splitters let homeowners use a single 220 volt electrical outlet to power two devices. One version of the product uses a common electric appliance outlet to power an appliance and an electric vehicle charger while the second version allows homeowners to safely power two EV chargers from a single outlet. Both were developed to make EV charging easier and more affordable for homeowners and renters.

The Backstory

NeoCharge is the brainchild of two engineers at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo bent on lowering the cost of installing an EV charger for homeowners. After interviewing hundreds of EV drivers, it was clear to co-founders Spencer Harrison and Akhil Veluru that the electrical work required to install Level 2 EV chargers in the home was a major financial barrier for many drivers.

Electric vehicle chargers can pull a lot of power, which can translate to thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars in costly electrical upgrades to the home. Spencer and Akhil set out to develop a solution and quickly honed in on developing a smart power splitter that allows homeowners to use a single 220 volt outlet to safely and intelligently power two devices. 220 volt outlets are commonly used in homes to power electric dryers, water heaters, heat pumps, stoves, or even another EV charger.

Real Savings

Utilizing an existing outlet to power an EV charger safely isn’t just a convenience for drivers, it translates into very real savings for many. When installing our first EV charger, the EnelX JuiceBox, we only had a single 220 volt outlet in the garage for our electric dryer. To install a new 220 volt NEMA 14-50 outlet would have cost at least $1,200 to run the new circuit and $2,000 to upgrade our 100 amp electrical panel to 200 or 250 amps.

The ability to simply purchase a $450 or $500 Smart Splitter from NeoCharge to enable the use of our EV charger with the existing dryer outlet would have been huge for us. Unfortunately, it did not exist back then, but fortunately for you, it does exist today and it just received UL approval, meaning it is completely safe to use.

The $3,200 cost estimate to add a new high power circuit to our home is not unusual. Ryan Meffert at NeoCharge said the average customer is avoiding $2,500 in infrastructure costs, with one customer saving a staggering $50,000 by purchasing the device. When an upgrade requires trenching across long distances, new electrical runs to the utility connection, concrete work, electrical panel upgrades, and new outlets, the cost of an upgrade stacks up quickly.

Intelligent Power Splitting

Their efforts bore fruit and soon, the NeoCharge Smart Splitter emerged as a viable solution to a very real problem. The Smart Splitter plugs into a single 220 volt outlet and intelligently splits power between two built-in outlets. The primary outlet on the left side of the Smart Splitter is able to pull as much power as it requires, while the secondary outlet on the right is throttled to use any additional capacity.

In the case of power sharing with an electric appliance like a dryer or heat pump, the appliance would get priority, with the EV charging ramping up when the primary appliance is not in use.

The Future is Bright

After years of rigorous testing, NeoCharge received their UL safety certification earlier this year and they are currently working with residential solar, EV charging, electricians, and utility companies. NeoCharge has won many notable awards including Caltech’s RocketFund grant, the LA Cleantech Incubators Innovators Award, and they were accepted as part of the Fall 2019 cohort at the LA Cleantech Incubator, one of the top business incubators in the world.

NeoCharge plans to expand into new product lines to continue to make driving an electric vehicle more affordable for drivers and to further their mission “To empower the people with access to clean and easy electric vehicle charging and home electrification.” NeoCharge is developing a new smartphone app that will let EV drivers charge when utility power is the cheapest, track energy consumption, and get notifications when charging is complete.

With more products and features coming soon, the future looks bright for both NeoCharge and our planet. For a limited time, use promo code CLEANTECHNICA for $30 off a NeoCharge Smart Splitter.","One huge challenge for many electric vehicle drivers is home charging.

A newly launched sustainable energy company, Jaguar New Energies, has announced it is offering small and large scale farmers clean energy with no upfront cost. The initial capital investment of installing a solar system is to be covered by a clean energy fund that is partly supported by the Dutch government.

The solar plant company was formed in partnership with South African based company New Southern Energy and two Dutch brands, Jaguar The Fresh Company and ForestEffect Fund. Together, they are seeking to enable Mzansi farmers in making an easy and clever transition to sustainable energy.

According to Deepak John, co-founder of Jaguar New Energies, the solar company is set to propel the South African agriculture sector and significantly reduce the operational cost of farmers, especially for energy.

“It will also help them be more independent from the energy grid. In the event of load shedding, power outages or grid failures, then at least they have a reliable and inexpensive source of energy,” John states.

He tells Food For Mzansi that the offering is unique in that it provides all size farming operations a rare opportunity to get solar at no initial cost. Jaguar New Energies will be financing the solar system for farmer and only sell the energy produced by the solar systems

John states, “Our aim is to always be cheaper than what they (farmers) are currently paying for electricity. For example if they are paying R1.50 per kilowatt hour, then we will always try to be much cheaper than that.”

In a recent article, Paulo Bello of Forest Effect Fund told the Europe based magazine Eurofruit that the no upfront investment model was made possible by their fund.

According to Bello, their model will also lead to “socio-economic benefits, with discounted electricity being made available to farming and rural communities”.

“With the Dutch government participating in our fund the integrity of our model is guaranteed,” he added.

Jaguar New Energies states that farmers will undergo a screening process beforehand. This will be done to ensure that they have the financial ability to honour the payment agreement.

“If a farmer is very small and does not have a very positive financial balance sheet, we might not be able to offer them the product,” John states.

New Southern Energy has spearheaded leading commercial and industrial projects in Africa and has installed multiple power systems throughout the continent.

John told Eurofruit that they understand the unique challenges of projects in various locations and will provide an end-to-end service with a single point of contact.

“This means farmers do not have to juggle multiple vendors, plans and schedules. NSE (New Southern Energy) manages every aspect of every project, so the farmer has a complete perspective of the process from beginning to end.

“The power and solutions are now – literally – in the farmer’s hands,” John said.

Kees Rijnhout, CEO of Jaguar The Fresh Company commented that South African farmers face a lot of economic challenges. According to him this includes, “the erratic supply of electricity that often leads to ‘dirty electricity’ from diesel generators.”

He adds, “with Jaguar having been involved in South Africa for decades we challenged ourselves to create a sustainable solution to this economic and environmental issue.”

Rijnhout said the Dutch Forest Effect Fund has outstanding experience in sustainable agricultural value chains, whilst New Southern Energies is a key player in the southern African solar energy market.

“Together we have excellent expertise on board to ensure that South African fruit farmers can extract solid value from this unique energy solution from day one.”","A new offering that eliminates the upfront setup costs means that South African agriculture and its farmers can now look forward to enjoying easy access to dependable and affordable solar energy.
A newly launched sustainable energy company, Jaguar New Energies, has announced it is offering small and large scale farmers clean energy with no upfront cost.
The solar plant company was formed in partnership with South African based company New Southern Energy and two Dutch brands, Jaguar The Fresh Company and ForestEffect Fund.

At a forum Friday night hosted by 17 community groups, 10 candidates — Mayor Michael Winkler, Vice Mayor Paul Pitino, Stacy Atkins-Salazar, Emily Grace Goldstein, Nick Matthews, Oryan Peterson-Jones, Sarah Schaefer, Kimberley White, Collin Yeo and Camilla Zapata — agreed systemic racism was an issue in policing though the expressed different approaches ranging from reform to creating a whole new system.

Many candidates, such as Matthews and Pitino, took a more reformative approach, saying the Arcata Police Department should hire more people of color, and Pitino adding hiring more women would help, too.

“We’re in a town that’s probably 60% women and we’ve only got two or three women PD,” Pitino said. “It should be 50-50 at least.”

Atkins-Salazar also agreed with reforming the police and said immediate solutions could be citizen oversight committees, which others like Pitino also recommended, as well as requiring body cameras on police officers and cameras on police cars.

“Just ways for the citizens to police our police,” she said.

With citizen oversight committees, Peterson-Jones said it was especially important to recruit people of color in order to ensure their voices were heard.

Others like Yeo argued that the system couldn’t be reformed because the institution of policing was built on a racist foundation.

Winkler pointed to some of the reforms the council has already put in place, such as forming a public safety committee and encouraging a wide variety of people to join, and said the council is continuing to work on those issues.

The candidates agreed the city needs more affordable housing alternatives, such as tiny home villages and safe camping and parking spaces, for those who cannot access traditional low-income housing. However, again, candidates expressed different approaches to remedying the issue.

Pitino said he agreed with housing alternatives, but the issue for the city was that there was no money to fund the operation or the improvements required for the city-owned land to have such a project.

“I feel like we should probably reach into our reserves, build the improvements to the property and then ask for somebody to run it who’s going to be a nonprofit and could oversee it,” Pitino said. “Similar to Opportunity Village.”

Zapata, Matthews, Atkins-Salazar and Goldstein pointed out even if the council members support a project, nearby residents of a potential project tend not to want affordable housing alternatives in their neighborhood.

“If we’re going to be successful in coming up with alternative housing solutions, we’re going to really need to engage with our community and get community support,” Atkins-Salazar said.

Yeo and Schaefer said it was important to increase access to affordable housing, including passing Measure B to increase the cap on affordable housing in the city, implementing rent control and curbing the power of predatory management companies.

Peterson-Jones said he supported a spectrum of services to prevent eviction and help people maintain their housing, special resources for the chronically homeless who might need multiple services.

“I believe that a full range of housing options are necessary and need to be explored with an emphasis on social services,” he said.

Peterson-Jones and Goldstein said decriminalizing homelessness was an important step because people were already setting up camping sites and that would decriminalize their attempt to survive.

“We need to stop raiding those communities, throwing their stuff and the trash and dislocating them,” Goldstein said.

White also agreed with having a tiny home village that had a variety of mental health and social services.

Winkler again pointed to his record and how he has professionally worked over 200 projects “that are virtually all solar and sustainable” over the past 10 years across the state.

“I support using the area south of Samoa, which the city owns now,” Winkler said. “We’re building a tiny house village.”

Homelessness is a countywide issue, Zapata said, so Arcata needs to start working with the other cities in the county to “move forward on a universal implementation.”

“Too many times cities individually don’t necessarily want to take it on,” she said. “We have a limited amount of land in Arcata and all it takes is one business owner to speak up and capitalism wins.”

Systemic racism in policing and affordable housing were just two of the many topics, such as traffic safety and the climate crisis, discussed by the candidates. To see the full forum, visit bit.ly/2S5yoLa.

The result the effort of co-founders Levi Conlow and Robby Deziel is a folding fat tire electric bike that was first and foremost affordable.

The Lectric XP is simple. It comes in black and white and packs a massive amount of functionality into a bike that retails for just $999 (on sale for $899 at the time of publication). In a world where most ebikes hover around the $2,000 price point, $999 is a fantastic price. On paper, the Lectric XP is impressive, but can it deliver when put to the test in the real world? They sent us the Lectric XP for us to run through the paces in the real world to see if it was truly up to the task.

Assembly

Right off the bat, the Lectric XP sets itself apart. It shows up in a compact box fully assembled, thanks to its folding design. Clipping off a few zip ties, clamp on the handlebar, and after a few small tweaks, we were off to the races. That’s a nice change from most ebikes, where an hour or two of assembly from a semi-skilled mechanic is required before they can be enjoyed.

After unboxing, we threw it on the charger and after a few hours, the light on the charger gave us a green light to get out onto the road for some riding. Naturally, we obliged.

Abuse aka the Road Test

Our test neighborhood is notoriously hilly, with several hundred feet of elevation gain in either direction from our test facility that puts the hurt on even the most robust electric motors. Modern ebikes with 750 watt motors can occasionally remove much of the pain from the climb, but anything less typically suffers a toasty and occasionally smokey fate.

With its 500 watt motor battling my 200 lb frame and the hill, the Lectric XP didn’t blow our socks off and forced us to take a less direct route up the hill. Thankfully, that was just the factory setting. The Lectric XP is unique in that the bike includes very simple instructions for tweaking the programming of the bike to enable a higher top speed and more torque.

After a few minutes of digital tuning using the handlebar controls and the integrated display back at the shop, we were off to the races. The new settings changed the game and transformed the XP from a mellow cruiser to a more substantial bike capable of easing most of the pain of climbing the hill. It’s not necessary for everyone, but it’s nice to know that a bit of programming can change the personality of the bike, if needed.

Out of the box, the Lectric XP is setup as a Class 2 ebike, but this same digital tuning unlocks a higher top speed of 28 miles per hour to make it a true Class 3 ebike. Rules and regulations around ebikes vary significantly in different cities, states, and countries, so be sure to check with your local regulations before buying and tuning the Lectric XP.

The Essentials

The Lectric XP comes well equipped, with 20 x 4 inch tires that provide a nice bit of cushion on the frame. They do not fully replace a set of shocks, but they certainly do take the edge off of smaller bumps and dips in the road. The knobby Chaoyang tires provide plenty of traction for the occasional off road jaunt.

The seat on the Lectric XP is a nice, plush seat that leans far more towards comfort than lightweight. It’s a nice upgrade compared to many of the hard but light seats that aren’t as friendly to the posterior on longer rides.

From the factory, the XP comes well-equipped with a set of metal fenders, rear rack, and a set of front and rear powered lights. The lights can be manually activated by holding down the up arrow on the left-mounted remote control. A large center mounted display makes it easy to see if the lights are on, how much energy is left, the current speed, pedal assist level and more. In our testing, we found the display to be extremely easy to read even in the brightest of direct sunlight.

The grips on the narrow handlebar are a bit firm and leave a bit to be desired when it comes to comfort. Otherwise, their ergonomic shape make long rides a breeze. A right-mounted Shimano shifter makes it easy to shift the Shimano Tourney derailleur between one of the 7 rear gears ranging from 14-28T.

The Lectric XP is easy to fold, with a center pivot that allows the frame to fold in half. A second folding point at the bottom of the stem cuts off some of the vertical height of the bike. At the rear of the bike, the extra long alloy seat post collapses down to further shrink the profile of the folded bike.

While it may fold, at 63 pounds, the Lectric XP still isn’t going to be the easiest to move around, but that’s not the point. It’s a fully capable, full featured electric bike that is easier to get into and out of the car because it folds. If that’s helpful, great. If not, don’t fold it and it will still work just fine as a standard electric bike.

The design of the folding Wellgo P256 pedals with the center spindle sticking out of the profile made them a bit slippery, but with the right shoes, were not a problem. It was something to keep an eye out for when testing, but should not be a showstopper as pedals are easily changed, if it comes down to that.

The Lectric XP’s 500-watt rear hub motor and frame-integrated removable are rated to deliver approximately 25-45 miles per charge, depending on rider weight, support level, weather, and terrain. At 499 Wh, the 48 volt battery is smaller than many comparable full-sized electric bikes, but is more than sufficient to power the 500-watt motor for many miles.

Accessories

The Lectric XP is well equipped right out of the gate and the company offers a range of accessories to tweak it to your exact needs. A set of water resistant panniers will set buyers back $49 to add saddle bags that mount to the rear rack. That’s a great value for a set of bags to get you up and running. We packed in a bag of coffee, several small parcels for the post office and some pastries and had plenty of room to spare.

A suspension seat post and spare battery round out the accessories. Lectric also offers replacement tires, tubes, seat, and charger in case a spare is needed or it is time to replace worn components.

271,https://www.housingfinance.com/finance/the-surprising-market-resilience-of-affordable-housing,"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 19:18:03 GMT",Apartment Finance Today,The Surprising Market Resilience of Affordable Housing,"The Surprising Market Resilience of Affordable Housing Business as usual? Not quite, says an industry expert, but indicators remain strong.

Maybe the surprising news about affordable housing is how little surprising news there is.

Like the little engine that could, the sector continues to chug through the nation’s economic uncertainty with energy and determination. That’s just one takeaway from a recent interview with CBRE Affordable Housing’s executive vice president Tim Flint.

Flint is a leader on the CBRE Affordable Housing sales and advisory services team, focusing on transaction management, business development, and client service delivery. The 16-year industry veteran has directed over 600 low-income housing tax credit and Department of Housing and Urban Development transactions totaling more than $6 billion.

What explains affordable housing’s comparative calm? Where does Flint see the industry’s trajectory in 2021 and beyond? A few thoughts:

Where do things stand at this time in late summer?

Deals are getting done. True, it’s not business as usual, given the travel and property inspection issues, but even in April we were putting properties under contract and closing them in June. We’re not 100% back, but affordable housing is in better shape than other commercial property types right now.

What explains this encouraging environment?

I think investors like what they see with affordable housing. The demand for clean, affordable housing is high and isn’t going away. There are no immediate tax policy threats. Plus, the multifamily investor is so much more sophisticated today than they were, say 15 years ago. Their investment objectives are clear and understood.

How is the upcoming election influencing the market?

There’s a small minority waiting out the election on the sidelines, but the majority of investors think long-term, well beyond the election, five and 10 years out. They’re not so election focused. The affordable housing market fundamentals are strong, so the election isn’t being seen as a major disruption.

Marissa Natkin

How are you advising investors right now?

There’s no need to act rashly because of what investors are observing in other property types, like retail or class A office. The conditions are different in affordable housing. There are fewer inhibitors on planning affordable housing deals, so investors can proceed with more confidence.

Take the agencies for example. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae listen carefully to market voices and do their part to respond. They take our feedback and work at coming up with products and processes to better recapitalize affordable multifamily properties.

What else encourages you about the sector?

Most investors are very cognizant of the social impact of their investment decisions. They understand their role in the big picture. Don’t get me wrong—investors expect a fair or better return. Yet, I think you’d be shocked by how many investors enter into a deal with a view of not only rehabilitating and preserving the affordability of the property but also improving the lives of the residents who live there.

The affordable housing market’s certain high demand incentivizes public and private leaders to come up with smart, creative financing solutions. The long-term prospects for the industry have never been better.

Three Arizona cities, however, were recently ranked by SmartAsset as being among the 25 most affordable locations for renters living alone.

Tucson cracked the top ten at No. 4, while Glendale placed No. 19 and Phoenix came in at a tie for No. 23 with Washington D.C. and Baltimore.

The study compared 100 of the largest cities in the country with five metrics: average rent for two or fewer bedrooms, the percent of units available with fewer than two bedrooms, median earnings for full-time workers, cost of living and the unemployment rate of the area.

Tucson received high praise for being one of the best locations in the study for average rent ($628), the annual cost of living (around $19,600) and the unemployment rate of 8.4% in May.

The average monthly rent for two or fewer bedrooms in Glendale is $755, according to the study, while Phoenix is $821.

The cost of living for the two Valley cities is also higher than Tucson, with Phoenix and Glendale both being $21,225, according to the study.

Full-time workers make more in Glendale and Phoenix than Tucson, however, with the median in both cities earning over $40,000 a year compared to $35,784 in Tucson.

Phoenix and Glendale also had a slightly lower unemployment rate of 8.3%, according to the study.

Arizona was the only state in the study to have three locations in the top 25.

Cincinnati for the third year in a row was deemed the most affordable location in the country for single renters.

Cozy, simple pieces featured in Target's new fall home goods collection, designed in collaboration with Studio McGee.

“Threshold – Designed with Studio McGee” marks the beginning of a multi-year partnership between the big-box store and a husband-and-wife team known for the warm and comfortable vibes they create for their clients. Their first collection together, which included lots of clean, bright, and effortlessly chic items for the living room and entry area, launched back in April. Now, they’re releasing a fall collection aiming to pump up the coziness as cooler weather rolls in.

“I am a huge fan of this partnership because I love that Target cares about bringing good design to everybody, which aligns perfectly with my goal to build a brand that makes good design feel approachable,” says Shea McGee, who founded the studio with her husband Syd in 2014.

The snazzy Industrial Adjustable Metal Base Counter Height Stools featured in Target and Studio McGee's collaborative line of fall decor.

She’s not kidding, either — these pieces are seriously affordable without skimping on style, with the furniture items feeling just as on-trend as the offerings at much more expensive retailers. For instance, the Surfside Round Wood End Table ($119) has a sculptural look that’ll bring a little creativity into the mix, and the Mercer Rolled Arm Upholstered Chair ($349) looks like a freshened-up antique with its front legs supported by brass casters. On the other hand, the Industrial Adjustable Metal Base Counter Height Stool ($79) makes a great complement to any industrial, modern, or farmhouse decor.

For maximum fall comfiness, McGee recommends mixing in some rich colors and textures with textiles like the Eyelash Chunky Knit Throw Blanket ($35) in rust, cream, or taupe. Pendant, floor, and table lamps enhance the ambiance and add a warm glow, with the Large Seagrass Pendant Table Lamp ($200) in particular making for a great way to work an organic element and a little woven pattern into your space at the same time.

Story continues

Wall art is another strong point in the collection, and there are extraordinarily well-priced options here in a variety of styles, whether you’re into abstract modern art or traditional oil paintings. Just look at the 12” x 16” Woman Figural Sketch Framed Wall Art ($18), the 27” x 47” On Sunset Mesa Medium Wood Framed Wall Canvas ($70), and the 16” x 20” Neutral Abstract Framed Wall Canvas Black/White ($28).

“Designing for clients is really specific, as I’m taking one family’s needs and desires and creating a look for just them,” says McGee. “However, with Threshold – designed with Studio McGee, I get to appeal to a broader audience, so I’ve honed in on classic, foundational pieces and then added color and trend in the accents. There’s this sense of positivity—of joy—that permeates the people, the culture, the work.”

“I’ve been struck by the Target team’s deep expertise for design and knowledge of their guests, and I have been so impressed by how much thought goes into the design of every single thing. The collection we’ve created together is beautiful, timeless, and the prices are incredible. I’m using these pieces in my clients’ spaces and love seeing how Target guests bring them to life in their own homes.”

Interior Designer Shea McGee stands proudly among pieces from her new fall collection with Target.

The whole collection officially became available for purchase on September 13th.

By the time Barrie Parker, principal broker at Asset Real Estate and Management closed on the last of the neighborhood’s 50 newest homes in February, properties there had been selling at a steady clip for nearly two years, mostly between $550,000 and $665,000.

Nowadays though, prices like that are nearly a thing of the past. In his semi-monthly Griggs Report, principal broker Michael Griggs said that at the end of August there were just 27 homes in North Kona for sale under $700,000, down from 44 this time last year.

And prices are going up. At the end of August, the median price of a home in the area rose to $701,000, more than $50,000 higher than the start of this year. By comparison, that figure increased by just $8,000 in the first eight months of last year.

Cameron Miculka/Civil Beat

Parker’s already seen the impact in Wainani Estates, where he said resales have sold upwards of $800,000. Not far away in Pualani Estates, where he was sales manager, homes that once sold in the $500,000 range now go for more than $700,000.

Altogether, it underscores the growing gap between what many local families can afford in North Kona — where the estimated median annual household income is $65,682 — and what it costs to bring new homes onto the local market.

There are some new variables at work. The average interest rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage, for example, hit a record low eight times between March and the first week of August. But there are also persistent factors like high costs of infrastructure and development. And ultimately, local professionals say, the issue boils down to supply and demand: North Kona doesn’t have enough homes for everyone who wants one.

Still Seeing Demand From Off-Island

The trend, especially now, shows how home prices are being driven by more than just local wages, said Kenna StormoGipson, policy and data analyst at the Hawaii Budget and Policy Center. With out-of-state buyers making up 41% of sales on Hawaii island in 2018, she said a state study shows prices are driven more by what someone somewhere else is willing to pay.

That demand hasn’t disappeared. Gretchen Osgood, principal broker and owner of Hawaiian Isle Real Estate, said Kona is seen as an attractive, remote place away from what ails the continental U.S., and potential buyers are flying in and quarantining before hitting the market. Meanwhile, those who already own property here have no motivation to sell, so new listings aren’t replacing what sells.

And post-pandemic, off-island demand isn’t certain to diminish. Osgood said Amazon Air’s recent expansion of operations to West Hawaii “speaks volumes as to what’s coming to Hawaii.”

“Why would a company the size of Amazon be investing that way in a remote location if they didn’t see the future as being bigger than what it is today?” she said.

An opportunity for the county, StormoGipson said, could be to increase property taxes on second homes, putting the revenue toward affordable housing. Back in June, the Hawaii County Council voted to increase taxes on second homes by $2.50 for every $1,000 in property value over $2 million.

Council Chairman Aaron Chung told Civil Beat that although he originally envisioned the plan as a way to fund affordable housing and address homelessness, the county administration had been working on a similar tax plan to address the budget crunch.

However, Osgood said out-of-state buyers should be applauded for what they contribute to the local economy as taxpayers and consumers. Not only do they pay 12 months of property taxes regardless of how much time they spend on the island, she said, they’re also hiring local workers to care for the property year-round and spending money locally when they are here. All the while, she added, they’re leaving a light footprint on resources like public safety.

“You couldn’t ask for a better upper base to your community,” Osgood said.

Zendo Kern, planning consultant at Kern and Associates, also expects there will always be some demand from people who want to live on the island, both from in- and out-of-state, even as supply becomes more limited.

“So that’s Economics 101, right? Supply and demand,” he said.

New Construction Faces Hurdles

Increasing supply, like building more houses, isn’t easy though — let alone building affordable houses. Osgood said development costs these days can be roughly $400 a square foot, driven in part by what developers see as burdensome codes and regulations that restrict affordable developments.

“We talk about affordable housing and yet a lot of the building code and subdivision code and zoning code doesn’t necessarily link up with that,” Kern said. With construction costs constantly increasing, that’s going to restrict the final sale price.

In early August, West Hawaii Today reported the council approved a new construction code aimed at streamlining the permitting process by rolling separate permits into a single one.

Infrastructure costs also drive prices up to cover the costs of roads, sidewalks, curbs and the like.

For a developer, Parker said, getting the necessary infrastructure in is “almost impossible” and, for the county, “a long-term venture.”

County Housing Administrator Duane Hosaka with the Office of Housing and Community Development also said the lack of infrastructure and suitable land for building both pose obstacles to building more affordable housing.

StormoGipson said infrastructure like roads and septic systems should be a public investment, though, not rolled into the cost of a house. By making those investments wisely, like in places close to mass transit and jobs, it can support development that leads to more homes.

And as the gap between local incomes and home prices grows, it calls for a robust housing policy that supports making more affordable homes available to local workers.

Since the 1970s, StormoGipson said, American public housing policy has focused primarily on rentals, which remain critical for those whose incomes are too low to qualify for a mortgage. But she said there are also those who, with a manageable down payment and purchase price close to at-cost, could move out of rentals to become homeowners and reap benefits like opportunities to build equity and have a home they can either stay in or pass on.

In other countries that have effectively tackled their housing problems, StormoGipson said, the private market where homes are bought and sold at market rates exists alongside a separate market: one more publicly supported and more publicly controlled.

The key, she said, is ensuring homes the public puts time and money into making affordable stay that way. It’s great if someone can get a home at an affordable price. It’s less so if they resell it at market rate and there’s one fewer affordable home for the next person.

That means restricting the resale price for the life of the project, which in some places can be 30-60 years. San Francisco’s Limited Equity Program, for example, gives low-to-moderate income earners a path to buying their first home below market rate, and when a homeowner wants to sell, the city sets the price and assigns a buyer via a lottery.

A program of that scale isn’t the only option. Griggs cited a past public-private partnership between the county and a developer that led to “very affordable” houses being sold in Waikoloa. Whatever the way forward may be, he said, affordable housing “all really rests in the county’s lap.”

With the pandemic’s direct impacts now seizing the spotlight, Parker said he’s worried affordable housing “will go in a bin with a bunch of other priorities.”

“It wasn’t handled before, and, I hate to say, I don’t see it improving,” he said.

County Remains Committed

County leadership has indicated affordable housing remains a priority. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported the county is looking at ways to ease the process for building ohana units, subsidies for water infrastructure and “pocket neighborhoods.”

Hosaka said there’s still a big need to both build more units and restore/expand existing rental projects. Currently, he added, the county’s working with developers on projects either in-development or expected to break ground within the next year that would add more than 500 units to inventory.

Asked about what role the county can have in helping people become homeowners, Hosaka said the county will continue facilitating development and providing technical help to developers to speed up the process.

One North Kona project in the works would build 450 multi-family rental and for-sale units aimed at the part of the population that earns too much to qualify for affordable housing but not enough to rent or buy close to their jobs, according to a draft environmental assessment for the project.

The units would be clustered in two- and three-story buildings over about 70 acres between Kona Vistas and Pualani Estates. The approximately 274 “for-sale” units, for example, would be within 10 two-story, four-unit buildings and 39 three-story, six-unit buildings.

Kern, the lead planner on the Royal Vistas project, said the multi-family approach lets them take advantage of economies of scale to lower infrastructure and development costs. They anticipate the multi-family units, he said, could be close to half the cost of the homes at the neighboring Kona Vistas, potentially giving families an alternative to renting and the opportunity to own a home.

“And I think that does a lot for the way the families feel and the way that the kids see it. When you see that your folks own the house, I think that’s a very positive thing for young folks to see,” Kern said. “It gives them hope that they can do the same.”

Kern said he hopes to have permitting complete by the end of 2021 and start building in 2022.","And ultimately, local professionals say, the issue boils down to supply and demand: North Kona doesn’t have enough homes for everyone who wants one.

Indianapolis-based T&H Investment Properties LLC is expected to spend around $12 million on the project at 401 E. Southern Ave., which will be known as the Garfield Parkside Townhomes.

The 2.5-acre development would be split between seven buildings, according to filings with the city and a separate project slideshow obtained by IBJ.

The units—all of which are expected to have three-bedrooms—would be available to individuals and families making 30%, 50% and 60% of the area’s median income, with a maximum four-person family income of $70,000.

The units would start out as rentals, but T&H plans to permit residents to move forward with purchasing their units after several years on a lease.

Michelle Strahl-Salinas, director of the the South Indy Quality of Life Plan neighborhood organization, said the T&H development is intended to go hand-in-hand withefforts to create affordable, transit-oriented housing for south-side residents.

“We are very interested in transit-oriented development and trying to leverage resources around that,” she said. “So we see this as part of that revitalization.”

She said the firm plans to spend about $12.5 million for the development. The slideshow indicates a per-unit cost of about $255,000—or $11.7 million.

T&H is pursuing 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits from the Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority for the project, with a filing for the request due Sept. 18. It’s expected to find out in February whether it will receive the funds.

T&H is also involved in the redevelopment of the former St. John United Church of Christ building in Cumberland.

Each town house in the Garfield Park-area development is expected to include a carport, with an additional 19 parking spaces planned in front of two of the buildings. The community would also feature a community room, a playground and a small retail space.

The land for the project, which sits at the southwest corner of Southern Avenue and East Street, was acquired by the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership in 2018 for about $630,000, according to property records.

The property was previously occupied by the Garfield Park Church of God.

T&H Investments and INHP are in the process of requesting a variance of development standards to ease setback requirements for the project, allowing it to be closer to the rights of way for both Southern Avenue and East Street.

The Board of Zoning Appeals approved the request Sept. 8, and it’s expected to go before the Metropolitan Development Commission in the coming weeks. If approved there, it will be up for final approval by the City-County Council.

Another variance will likely be required to move the project forward, although that’s not expected to be requested until funding is finalized. INHP is expected to eventually sell the land to T&H Investments.

Construction is expected to begin in October 2021, with completion slated for April 2023.

Parker: Thanks to donation, Horizon Housing converting hotel into affordable housing

Article content Wanting to respond to the pandemic in a way that would benefit people’s health, a Calgary businessman — who prefers to remain anonymous — has made a significant donation in connecting health to housing. Thanks to his generous gift, Horizon Housing has acquired The Elan, a boutique hotel at 1122 16th Avenue S.W., and is converting it into affordable residences. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The building is perfect for the not-for-profit developer and property manager. An eight-storey structure, it was originally built as an apartment block but converted to a trendy boutique hotel in 2013, just off 14th Street and a block from pedestrian-friendly 17th Avenue.

Article content The Elan comes with 62 “ready-made” studio and one and two-bedroom units that require very little refurbishing. All have kitchens, apart from the studios that are currently having them added. There is also a community kitchen on the ground floor that can be enjoyed by residents as a friendly get-together café. Jileckova also has plans to open it up for neighbourhood use and is reaching out to the community to look for needs that might include events such as cooking classes.

Article content Residents will enjoy use of a small fitness room, meeting spaces, underground parking and a large facing-the-sun front patio area. The location looks out over 17th Avenue and is ideally located for grocery shopping at the nearby Co-op Midtown Market and Urban Fare, walking distance to drug stores, Canadian Tire, Best Buy and a number of restaurants and entertainment venues.

Article content Arianne Barry, director of stakeholder relations at Horizon Housing, says The Elan will be ready to welcome residents by December and leasing is underway. A mixed-income model, half of the units are reserved as subsidized affordable homes working through partner social service agencies. The remainder will be offered at near market value, making the project sustainable and able to support the $3-million mortgage to complete the purchase and renovation of the building. The need for more rental housing is great. It’s hard to build a life without a home and, today, 17,000 renter households are at risk of homelessness, joining 2,900 Calgarians who sleep in shelters or on the streets each night. It is estimated that more than 44,000 others are overspending on housing.

Article content Including The Elan, Horizon Housing owns and operates 18 properties in all four quadrants of the city. Nine of them are apartment buildings and nine operate as supportive group homes, providing homes for 1,100 residents. In the past five years, the organization has invested more than $5 million in capital upgrades to ensure its residents enjoy quality homes. With The Elan almost ready for guests, Horizon Housing is preparing to break ground on a new facility in the Pineridge community that will provide another 65 units of mixed-income housing. Horizon Housing, which traces its history as a society to 1976 in Calgary, has a staff of 28 and a core of volunteers led by an active board of directors and CEO Jelickova, who also serves on the board of Community Housing Transformation Centre, a Montreal-based Pan-Canadian non-profit organization working with housing organizations across Canada to drive transformation, sustainability and growth in community housing. Notes: There’s definitely a back-to-business feeling in the air as many office workers are returning to downtown towers, which is a big lift for restaurants and the many coffee shops that have eked out an existence for such a long time. In the ‘burbs, it’s good to see that the Inglewood Night Market reopens — in two 9th Avenue parking lots between 11th and 12th streets S.E. — on Fridays starting Sept. 4. And people in the northwest have welcomed Save-On-Foods and Market Wines as the first of a number of new retailers to open in University District. David Parker appears regularly in the Herald.

Financing for this project will come in the form of a mortgage from the federal government – $10.8 million of which is a forgivable loan.

With the help of the National Housing Co-Investment Fund (NHCF), OCH’s affordable housing developments will be built in Ottawa and are located in areas close to public transit, community centres, and support services. Of the proposed 698 units, a total of 211 units will be earmarked at affordable rents lower than 80 per cent of median market rent for the neighbourhood.

The new affordable rental homes will support those of all ages, family compositions, and demographics, but 179 of the homes will be dedicated to priority groups such as seniors, women and children fleeing domestic violence, those facing mental health and addiction issues, and newcomers.

Providing safe and stable housing affords greater opportunities for residents to find and keep jobs, learn and build skills, and be active participants in their communities.

“Affordable housing continues to be a priority for the City of Ottawa,” said Mayor Jim Watson. “Council recently approved the refreshed 10-Year Housing and Homelessness Plan, which sets ambitious targets – including eliminating unsheltered, veteran and chronic homelessness, and creating up to 8,500 new affordable housing options by 2030. Let’s continue to work together, with our federal and provincial partners, to ensure that everyone in our city has a place that they can call home.”

The portfolio, on average, will comply with the highest level of accessibility i.e. barrier free common areas and 31%+ of units meet accessibility standards or full universal design and 21 per cent of units meet accessibility standards.

The investment also aims to achieve over 55 per cent reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions relative to the 2015 National Energy Code for Buildings.

The Government of Canada and OCH acknowledge that the buildings, located at 811, 818, and 933 Gladstone, are being built on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishnaabeg people.","The Ottawa Community Housing Corporation (OCH) announced it is making a $167.9 million financial commitment toward the construction of approximately 700 new affordable rental homes, the largest single investment awarded to an affordable housing provider in Ottawa under the National Housing Strategy.

280,https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2020/09/tesla-s-new-affordable-battery-promises-major-range-boost/,"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",E&T Magazine,Tesla’s new affordable battery promises major range boost,"Tesla founder Elon Musk has unveiled his firm’s latest battery technology which promises more affordable cars that can travel longer distances, but the three-year timeframe necessary before commercialisation has not impressed investors.

Musk envisions future electric cars priced as low as $25,000 (£19,657) that will be able to drive themselves once the new battery tech comes to fruition. The new technology would slash the cost of batteries in half as well as extending their range by 56 per cent.

This implies that Tesla cars using the new batteries will be able to travel 500 miles or more on a single charge, surpassing the distance many internal combustion engine (ICE) cars can travel before needing to refuel.

The retail cost estimates are also significantly cheaper than Tesla’s lowest-priced car, currently the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 (£27,791).

“We don’t have a truly affordable car and that is something we want in the future,” Musk said during a showcase event dubbed 'Battery Day'. Building an affordable electric car “has always been our dream from the beginning of the company,” he added.

However, investors were not impressed by the three-year timeframe stated by Musk, who has infamously underestimated shipping dates and production volumes of Tesla’s vehicles on many occasions. Tesla’s shares fell by more than 6 per cent in extended trading after Musk’s presentation.

Earlier this year, the automaker became the most valuable car company in the world, reaching a valuation of $208bn and overtaking rival Toyota in the process. While the latest share price drop may sound like bad news for the firm, the shares are still worth nearly ten times their value at this time last year.

Since that time, Tesla has posted four consecutive quarters of profits, reversing a long history of losses, whilst also boosting its production and laying the groundwork for future expansion by opening or beginning work on three more factories in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, Texas.

Musk has seen his estimated personal wealth climb to $89bn (£70.31bn), the fifth-largest fortune in the world, according to estimates by Forbes magazine.

“What happens when companies get bigger is things tend to slow down. We are going to speed up,” Musk said.

Tesla will produce the new battery cells initially on a new assembly line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, with planned output reaching 10 gigawatt-hours a year by the end of 2021. Tesla and partner Panasonic now have production capacity of around 35GWh at the Nevada battery 'gigafactory'.","Tesla founder Elon Musk has unveiled his firm’s latest battery technology which promises more affordable cars that can travel longer distances, but the three-year timeframe necessary before commercialisation has not impressed investors.

You've found yourself reading this story so I'm going to take that as a yes. Since spotting fashion's It items is one my favorite pastimes, I'm taking it upon myself to report all my recent findings and have gone so far as to source alternatives that are friendlier to my own shopping budget. Whether you're looking to make your next investment purchase or simply curious to see what's trending, I've got you covered.

From Prada's logo-adorned loafers to Ganni's rubber-soled stompers, the following six items are quickly becoming key pieces in the fashion world—and we have the Instagram evidence to prove it. The good news is splurging on one of these designer items isn't the only way to participate in the trending silhouettes of the moment. With a little bit of shopping research and a keen eye for spotting expensive-looking details, I sourced a number of options that emulate these coveted styles but at a much more wallet-friendly price point. Look no further than these affordable buys to get a similar look for a fraction of the cost.

1. Prada Nylon Re-Edition Shoulder Bag

I had to start this off by highlighting the bag that's on pretty much every fashion girl's wishlist at the moment. Prada came out with a re-release of its 2005-era shoulder bag but added a cool chain strap and detachable crossbody strap to give it even more utility. Take it from our senior fashion editor Lauren who's fully on board or peruse one of the chain strap baguette bags I'm also eyeing.

2. Ganni Knee-High Rubber Boots

Meet fall's coolest boots (in my opinion, at least). Ganni's chunky knee-high boots are already making the rounds on Instagram and fall has barely just begun. The rubber-soled look is set to be a popular boot trend in general, which is why the below Hunter rain boots are also idling in my cart.

NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Purewrist , a provider of end-to-end contactless transaction solutions as a prepaid card program manager and wearable technology developer, today announced the launch of a new mass market wearable, Purewrist GOTM. Purewrist GO is a stylish and comfortable bracelet that allows safe and secure contactless payment transactions, empowering consumers to take advantage of a simple wearable payment device without the need to touch cash or a card again. It is supported by the all new Purewrist payment platform and mobile application.



The Purewrist GO wearable delivers style, simplicity and affordability to the U.S. mass market. Retailing at only $25, users receive a color-customizable bracelet, contactless Mastercard® prepaid card, account activation, and a pre-loaded amount of $10, $25, or $50. Upon receipt and activation of the Purewrist bracelet, pre-loaded funds are immediately available for purchases at establishments with NFC-enabled contactless readers, such as retail stores, restaurants, mass transit and more. Purewrist GO account holders may access their PIN-protected Mastercard account card number in-app, which is further masked for security to complete online transactions.

Users can upgrade their bracelet at any time to an FDIC-insured, personalized reloadable account at no extra cost after completing identity verification. Reloadable accounts are funded through an existing bank account or credit/debit card and offer an option for automatic reload for convenience.

“We’re excited to launch not only Purewrist’s innovative contactless, wearable payment solution Purewrist GO, but also our expanded platform that empowers consumers across North America. While adoption of contactless payment solutions has been on the rise due to its convenience, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that a greater need exists for safe contactless transactions at retailers and for Smart Mobility in public transportation,” said Suresh Palliparambil, CEO of Purewrist. “In addition to its public health benefits, contactless payments offer a sense of ease as more consumers seek to enhance their shopping experience. With Purewrist, consumers can safely purchase and travel with just the tap of a wrist, while merchants provide shorter wait-times for customers and added safety to their employees.”

The waterproof bracelet is made from an ultra-durable silicone material that is easy to clean and disinfect - no batteries necessary. It meets strict payment-industry security standards and ID theft protection by leveraging NXP Semiconductor’s leadership position in NFC technology. With each bracelet, Purewrist offers a free companion mobile application and online portal that allows the user to check their balance, view transactions, manage limits, customize reload preferences, set alerts and lock their wearable if it is lost. Most importantly, consumers can feel good about their purchase, as ten percent of the net profits will be donated to charity through the GratitudeTM give back program.

“NXP is proud to work with Purewrist to bring this exciting wearable payment solution to market,” said Alasdair Ross, Head of Marketing of Secure Payments at NXP. “2020 had seen unprecedented change in the dynamics of the payment market, most notably the surge in consumer demand to pay contactless. Purewrist GO addresses this demand with a solution that is innovative, secure, and convenient.”

Purewrist GO is the flagship consumer product of the larger Purewrist platform. The fintech platform provides not just a wearable, but an end-to-end program and technology experience with reloadable prepaid accounts that can be used anywhere Mastercard Debit is accepted. The Company offers solutions for businesses, individuals and families alike with the option to create accounts for employers to distribute financial benefits and rewards to employees, or for parents to automate the amount and frequency of allowance to children and instill values of financial responsibility at a younger age.

“Purewrist is more than just a wearable, it is a complete fintech solution with endless possibilities. We’re bringing a more affordable solution to the mass market to make contactless payments more accessible,” said Ari Gardiner, co-founder of Purewrist. “We are involved in and touch upon so many areas of the fintech space that we can give our customers a simpler experience without compromising safety and security.

HYDERABAD: Easy, affordable and healthy eating can help people from falling prey to Covid-19, say nutritionists.

The food consumed impacts the human body's ability to fight diseases and recover from infections and eating a healthy, nutritious, and balanced diet is important amid global pandemic, they said on the occasion of national nutrition week, being celebrated from September 1 to September 7.

Though no food will cure Covid-19 infections, a healthy diet along with good physical activity will help build a stronger immune system to tackle the adverse impact of the deadly coronavirus, they said.

As the nutrition week is being celebrated amidst the pandemic, doctors say it is important to know that good nutrition helps reduce the risks of ailments like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart diseases, which are common reasons for falling prey to coronavirus. Many types of cancers too can be prevented by consuming healthy and nutritious food.

According to common understanding, a healthy diet for a newborn baby means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breast milk from 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development while for aged, it can help to ensure healthier and more active life.

""Food makes a world of difference to our system which is linked to the solar clock. Eating at regular hours means the energy levels remain steady and do not sway from highs to lows. This will help body rhythm settle down and it will balance out the hormones to keep the body energized. Any food that is closest to its natural form, least processed and seasonal is the best for health,"" said Srilatha, Chief Clinical Nutritionist, Medicover Hospitals.

""Nutrient-rich food adds health while processed and refined foods add empty calories leaving you without energy and feeling low and can lead to many diseases. Fermented foods add good bacteria that keep the gut healthy and the absorption of nutrients efficient,"" she said.

One must include adequate amounts of whole grains, pulses, seasonal vegetables, green leafy vegetables, whole fruits, milk and milk products, and to add moderate amounts of non-veg foods focusing on fish and skinless chicken. Whole grains and pulses provide macro nutrients like carbohydrate and proteins. Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.

Adding nuts to daily food is a great habit, and it helps strengthen immunity. Nuts and oil seeds add healthy fats, dietary fibre, protein and most importantly, antioxidants, which are known to clean up the free radicals from the system. It is most important to take adequate fluids like water, lemon water, coconut water, buttermilk, homemade soups, pudina pani, zeera pani, and any other non-sugary liquids to stay hydrated. Even a mild dehydration leaves the human body exhausted.

""Like any army fighting an enemy, the immune system needs good, regular nourishment. It is observed that people who do not eat healthy and do not care for immunity are more vulnerable to infectious diseases like Covid-19. Eat right to stay tight, must be the philosophy when it comes to consuming sufficient vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients,"" said Zeenat Fatima, Nutritionist, Continental Hospitals.

Good nutrition and exercise is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system might need to fight back. Limited access to fresh foods may compromise opportunities to continue eating a healthy and varied diet. It can also potentially lead to an increased consumption of highly processed foods, which tend to be high in unhealthy trans fats, cholesterol, sugars, and salt. Nonetheless, even with few and limited ingredients, one can continue eating a diet that supports good health.","By IANSHYDERABAD: Easy, affordable and healthy eating can help people from falling prey to Covid-19, say nutritionists.

Miami Beach, FL, Sept. 18, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK, BLNKW) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blink Mobility, has acquired BlueLA Carsharing, the City of Los Angeles’ contractor for its EV carsharing services program, with 200 EV charging stations and 100 electric vehicles. The acquisition doubles the number of Blink stations in Los Angeles, making the use of EV cars more accessible to the community at large and supporting the City’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce resident exposure to harmful pollutants.

“California is the epicenter for EV adoption, and this acquisition significantly expands our market presence and strategically positions Blink as the City of Los Angeles’ contractor for its EV carsharing program with EV charging,” commented Michael D. Farkas, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blink. “The City of Los Angeles, California’s largest city, has made a substantial commitment to enabling citywide EV transportation alternatives with a clear strategy to grow its EV infrastructure, and a particular focus on its groundbreaking carsharing program that makes EV use attainable in disadvantaged neighborhoods. As the city moves into phases 2 and 3 of its EV carsharing program, we look forward to supporting the City’s aggressive environmental and EV accessibility objectives.”

“Blink is excited to maintain and advance the services of BlueLA. We believe we are uniquely positioned, with our state-of-the-art charging equipment and established mobility partnerships, to play a meaningful role in the City’s plan to bring zero emissions vehicles to the most air quality challenged areas of the City. In cooperation with the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability and Los Angeles Department of Transportation we look forward to working together to improve public health, particularly in disadvantaged communities. Blink’s vision has always been about making electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure accessible for all. Low-income families and communities of color – which are disproportionately impacted by pollution and face dire consequences for their health-should not be left behind by progress and we are committed to our partnership with Mayor Garcetti and the City of Los Angeles to ensure that expanded electric carsharing options, including BlueLA, remain available to all Los Angeles neighborhoods, especially those in the top 10% of census tracts that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution,” stated Mr. Farkas.

Story continues

Blink plans to make considerable enhancements to the existing BlueLA infrastructure to improve the customer experience. Pending City approval, Blink will upgrade the charging infrastructure to its IQ 200 charging stations. Further, Blink plans to outsource and collaborate with an experienced mobility provider to improve the EV carsharing service and upgrade the vehicles to include more practical EVs that better meet consumer demand. Finally, the Company is exploring additional ancillary services, such as digital media at charging locations as well as in the interior and exterior of the vehicles, to enhance the driver experience while also better monetizing locations.

Mr. Farkas concluded, “There is a tremendous market opportunity as urban centers throughout the country continue to transition to more environmentally friendly EV transportation models. Los Angeles is the heart of the EV revolution and is a community that has long recognized the importance and necessity of making clean transportation alternatives available to all members of the broader community. Through this acquisition, we believe Los Angeles can serve as a prototype for an EV carsharing and charging infrastructure program that can be replicated in other cities across the country. Our goal is to make EVs accessible by leveraging our network and expertise.”

Additional details regarding the acquisition can be found in the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 17, 2020.

As promised last week, here’s an updated look at the “affordable home” price chart.

In this graph I flip the variables in the affordability index calculation around to other sides of the equation to calculate what price home the a family earning the median household income could “afford” to buy at today’s mortgage rates, if they spent 30% of their monthly gross income on their home payment. Don’t forget that this math includes the (giant) assumption that the home buyers are putting 20% down, which would be $148,590 at today’s median price.

The “affordable” home price has shot up from $530,359 in November 2018 to an all-time high of $706,800 as of August. The current “affordable” home price in King County would have a monthly payment of $2,365.

The current gap of $36,150 between the affordable price and the median price is similar to the difference we saw between the two numbers in mid-2005.

If interest rates were at a more reasonable level of 6 percent (which is still quite low by historical standards), the “affordable” home price would be just $493,215—more than $200,000 below where it is today, and nearly $250,000 below the current median price.

Here’s the alternate view on this data, where I flip the numbers around to calculate the household income required to make the median-priced home affordable at today’s mortgage rates, and compare that to actual median household incomes.

As of August, a household would need to earn $99,466 a year to be able to “afford” the median-priced $742,950 home in King County. This is up from the low of $46,450 in February 2012, but down slightly from the May 2018 high of $119,004. The previous cycle high in July 2007 was $99,321. Meanwhile, the actual median household income in King County is estimated to be about $94,500.

If interest rates were 6% (around the pre-bust level), the income necessary to buy a median-priced home would be $142,540—51 percent above the current median income.","As promised last week, here’s an updated look at the “affordable home” price chart.

There are many easy, affordable and healthy eating which can help people from falling prey to COVID-19, say nutritionists.

The food consumed impacts the human body’s ability to fight diseases and recover from infections and eating a healthy, nutritious, and balanced diet is important amid global pandemic, they said on the occasion of national nutrition week, being celebrated from September 1 to 7.

Though no food will cure COVID-19 infections, a healthy diet along with good physical activity will help build a stronger immune system to tackle the adverse impact of the deadly coronavirus, they said.

As the nutrition week is being celebrated amidst the pandemic, doctors say it is important to know that good nutrition helps reduce the risks of ailments like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart diseases, which are common reasons for falling prey to coronavirus. Many types of cancers too can be prevented by consuming healthy and nutritious food.

According to common understanding, a healthy diet for a newborn baby means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breast milk from 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development while for aged, it can help to ensure healthier and more active life.

“Food makes a world of difference to our system which is linked to the solar clock. Eating at regular hours means the energy levels remain steady and do not sway from highs to lows. This will help body rhythm settle down and it will balance out the hormones to keep the body energized. Any food that is closest to its natural form, least processed and seasonal is the best for health,” said Srilatha, Chief Clinical Nutritionist, Medicover Hospitals.

“Nutrient-rich food adds health while processed and refined foods add empty calories leaving you without energy and feeling low and can lead to many diseases. Fermented foods add good bacteria that keep the gut healthy and the absorption of nutrients efficient,” she said.

One must include adequate amounts of whole grains, pulses, seasonal vegetables, green leafy vegetables, whole fruits, milk and milk products, and to add moderate amounts of non-veg foods focusing on fish and skinless chicken. Whole grains and pulses provide macro nutrients like carbohydrate and proteins. Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.

Adding nuts to daily food is a great habit, and it helps strengthen immunity. Nuts and oil seeds add healthy fats, dietary fibre, protein and most importantly, antioxidants, which are known to clean up the free radicals from the system. It is most important to take adequate fluids like water, lemon water, coconut water, buttermilk, homemade soups, pudina pani, zeera pani, and any other non-sugary liquids to stay hydrated. Even a mild dehydration leaves the human body exhausted.

“Like any army fighting an enemy, the immune system needs good, regular nourishment. It is observed that people who do not eat healthy and do not care for immunity are more vulnerable to infectious diseases like COVID-19. Eat right to stay tight, must be the philosophy when it comes to consuming sufficient vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients,” said Zeenat Fatima, Nutritionist, Continental Hospitals.

Good nutrition and exercise is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system might need to fight back. Limited access to fresh foods may compromise opportunities to continue eating a healthy and varied diet. It can also potentially lead to an increased consumption of highly processed foods, which tend to be high in unhealthy trans fats, cholesterol, sugars, and salt. Nonetheless, even with few and limited ingredients, one can continue eating a diet that supports good health.

At the same time, he said the ministry will be seeking the support of the private sector to help make this priority a reality, as the Government, in turn, provides support to investors and developers in the real estate industry.

Charles Jr said the Government has been very aggressive and advanced in its mandate to provide safe and practical housing solutions for Jamaicans and the ministry will continue to advance that mandate.

“We are looking to ensure that we provide practical housing solutions,” the new minister said.

He said the Government has adjusted several variables when it comes to housing, whether it is access to loans, interest rates or just the procedure to make it more efficient and effective.

“We are going to continue to examine the practices to make sure that we are putting forward the kind of mechanisms that afford as many Jamaicans as possible, the real opportunity to gain access to housing solutions and we are going to work with the private sector because it's not going be Government alone,” the minister said.

“A big part of what we have to do is to ensure that we are providing the support for those persons who want to take the risk, who want to invest in developing spaces in the country and that is going to be done through the necessary policies and legislation, and if there are changes that are going to be required, we will be properly guided by the technical experts in the ministry,” he added.

Charles Jr, the former senator and mMinister without portfolio with responsibility for housing and water, says he is confident that the ministry will be able to move forward.

“We have done a lot of work in the last tenure and we can only continue that work and get better,” he said.

Also on the minister's list of priorities are the environment and urban renewal.

“We are looking to ensure that we meet the mandate in terms of the global achievements for climate change in the Sustainable Development Goals and we are looking to ensure that we continue our very good track record when it comes to making decisions that make it very clear that this Government respects the environment and will ensure we put the environment as a priority area in our development mandate,” he said.

Urban renewal, Charles emphasised, is very critical as it “speaks to so many areas that are the faces of our cities, and making that a priority will ensure that we create an enabling environment where people will be able to not just live safely, but they will want to strive.”

The minister said he is honoured that the prime minister has placed such enormous confidence in his abilities to handle the new ministry, which he describes as “the coupling of very critical areas that speak to pivotal areas of our manifesto.”","KINGSTON, Jamaica - Minister of Housing, Urban Renewal, Environment and Climate Change, Pearnel Charles Jr, says providing practical, affordable and accessible housing solutions for all Jamaicans will be one of the key priorities for the ministry.

Ralph Northam announced a proposal to require the state’s electricity sector to produce net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, a requirement that he has since signed into law.

How are we doing toward attaining the goal?

On Tuesday, as part of the second annual summit (which is taking place virtually and concludes Wednesday), University of Virginia professor William Shobe gave Northam the first progress report.

Following Northam’s opening remarks, Shobe – who directs the Center for Economic & Policy Studies at UVA’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service and has been at the forefront of environmental research and policymaking for 25 years – outlined how it is feasible for Virginia to decarbonize the state’s economy.

UVA Today caught up with Shobe, a professor of public policy at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, to learn more.

Q. During your presentation at the summit, you said decarbonization by 2050 is “achievable and affordable.” Why do you believe this?

A. Virginia is an interesting case in thinking about how to eliminate carbon emissions for a state. We have a modest potential supply of renewable energy compared to many other states, and yet it turns out that, with current technology, we have more than enough to meet our needs. Add to that our existing nuclear plants, and our non-emitting energy resources outstrip any likely future requirement. So, from a purely technical point of view, we have ample non-fossil fuel resources to meet our energy needs.

And it is surprisingly affordable. New and improved solar and wind technology have made renewables cheaper than the coal and natural gas alternatives. Even without new policies, we will start to build solar power plants rather than new natural gas plants. The advances in technology have made it cost-effective for Virginia to generate its own energy, rather than import the energy from other places.

The final piece of the puzzle is efficiency. Shifting from fossil fuels to electricity in transportation and for heating and cooling in buildings results in large efficiency gains, which save lots of money. As costs continue to fall, the shift to all-electric buildings and transportation will be all but irresistible.

Q. Without getting too technical, can you tell us a little about the modeling you used?

A. For this modeling exercise, we worked with Evolved Energy Research, a firm specializing in long-run energy system analysis. We factor in current and likely future technology costs, demographics, weather and other factors to evaluate our future energy needs. Then we model the mix of energy resources that can meet these needs, but without any carbon dioxide emissions.

With increased use of renewable energy, you have to be careful to take into account the variability of the resource. For example, every year we have periods of cloudy, windless days, where renewables don’t produce much electricity. At other times they will produce much more than we need. We have to include storage technologies such as batteries, hydrogen and synthetic fuels that smooth out the variability in the supply so it better matches the pattern of how we use electricity.

Planning for the future also has to account for the shift in our patterns of energy use as we electrify cars, trucks, buildings and industrial processes. Converting these uses to electricity has substantial advantages, but the shift in patterns of use will affect the mix of resources we will use to supply the energy.

Q. For those who may be not be that well versed in decarbonization, what are the various economic, health and climate benefits that can be achieved by getting to net carbon zero?

A. If costs continue to fall the way they have recently, shifting from fossil fuels may ultimately be worth doing just for the financial savings alone. But there are other, compelling reasons for doing so.

v2_in-line_ad_-_uva_mask.jpg

Climate change is already beginning to hurt Virginia, and the consequences of rising temperatures are likely to rise quickly. Casting our lot in with the many other governments around the country and the world that have pledged to eliminate their emissions of greenhouse gases makes good policy sense. It is only by cooperating that we can solve the problem of climate change. Virginia’s move to eliminate its emissions will make it that much easier for others to increase the level of their commitment.

But it turns out that some of the greatest gains from reducing our fossil fuel use are to our own health. We have known for a long time that emissions from cars and trucks and from coal and natural gas power plants produce very damaging pollutants that result in lots of negative effects on both health and on worker and agricultural productivity. Even with our current pollution controls, these damages in Virginia alone are even greater than the damages from climate change.

We are currently working to produce good estimates of the true economic savings to health and productivity from reducing fossil emissions. We have reason to believe that these benefits are sufficiently large by themselves to justify much of our efforts at decarbonization.

Q. In your remarks, you discussed “The Four Pillars of Cost-Effective Decarbonization.” Can you give our readers a brief synopsis of them?

A. A large body of research now points to four components that are likely to be part of any cost-effective approach to decarbonization: efficiency in energy use, eliminating fossil fuels from electricity generation, electrifying transportation services and building energy use and, finally, capturing some remaining CO2 emissions and sequestering the carbon in geologic reserves.

Converting cars and buildings to electricity not only eliminates their direct emissions, but also increases efficiency, so there is a double savings. Increased efficiency makes it that much easier to supply the remaining energy needs. Capturing and sequestering some carbon will be necessary because it will be very expensive to eliminate the last, most recalcitrant uses. Fortunately, there are some reasonably affordable options for sequestering carbon, including good forest management, coastal ecosystem enhancement, and, ultimately, capturing CO2 from power plants that burn wood waste and other biomass.

Q. To get to net carbon zero, what specific emissions do we need to reduce, and what are some ways we can go about doing that? You mentioned some “timely adoptions” of electric technologies. What might be some examples?

A. The key is to eliminate fossil fuels from our electricity supply and from transportation and buildings. We need to continue to build out new solar generation, because it is cost-effective today. We need to move aggressively to electric cars and trucks. Building out infrastructure for charging vehicles is a pressing current need. Moving to replace gas-fired boilers and water heaters in homes and offices is another step we should start taking now; it is saves both carbon and money.

But it’s not just about what we can adopt today. It is critically important to begin investing in innovation in renewable energy generation and energy storage technologies. Lower costs in these technologies and in electric transportation plays to Virginia’s advantage. We need to start preparing for the likelihood that hydrogen produced using renewable energy will replace oil and natural gas. This will enhance the value of our renewable resources by pairing them with long-term energy storage. With investments in new knowledge, the state can move more aggressively to take advantage of opportunities to be its own least-cost energy producer.

Q. Anything else you’d like to add?

A. The transition away from fossil fuels does not happen on its own. We need to invest in enhancing the state’s ability to plan effectively and act efficiently in moving to a cleaner, fossil-free economy. Virginia needs to invest in developing the expertise needed for the energy transition. Without doing so, there is a danger that we will take a piecemeal and inefficient approach to the challenge before us. Investing now in the capacity for both technological innovation and the policy capacity to take advantage of it will pay large dividends.","During your presentation at the summit, you said decarbonization by 2050 is “achievable and affordable.” Why do you believe this?

Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

Aims For Affordable Solar Power,"Follow. The. Money. For all the talk about saving coal jobs over the past four years or so, the US Department of Energy has been pushing dollar after dollar onto the renewable energy plate. In the latest twist, the Energy Department is ramping up its efforts to bring affordable solar power to the nation’s vast population of low- and middle-income households, with a focus on new financial instruments.

Affordable Solar Power, Sooner Rather Than Later

The cost of solar power has been dropping like a rock, but rooftop solar is still out of reach for many US households. Money is a big part of a problem, but it’s not the only one. Shading, lack of roof space, tenant-landlord relations, and other nuts-and-bolts factors also tamp down on solar access.

Utility-based solar access is increasing for many electricity ratepayers, but the shift out of large scale fossil power is a long, slow process.

One trend that could help speed things along is community choice aggregation, which is now available in a handful of states. Among them is New York State, which has just launched a new solar program that could be a game-changer.

However, the aggregation model has been slow to catch on nationwide. It requires state-based legislation, and we’ll have to wait for the outcome of the November 3 elections to see if any other state legislatures start moving in that direction.

In the meantime, the Energy Department appears to have settled on community solar programs as the quickest way to ensure that affordable solar power is within the reach of every US household.

How long will that take? Check out DOE’s National Community Solar Partnership, which is on a mission to bring affordable solar power to every household in the US by 2025.

Persistent Poverty & The Rural Electric Cooperative Angle

For an assist, the Energy Department has turned to the nation’s sprawling network of rural electric cooperatives. That’s partly because the unique regulatory status of rural co-ops provides them with more wiggle room to adopt new financial strategies and new energy technologies that could help speed solar adoption.

Recent examples include a community energy storage project in Minnesota and a renewable energy mashup with the leading distributed energy resources firm AutoGrid though NRECA’s affiliation with the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative.

Rural co-ops also serve much of the nation’s low- and middle-income households, which lends a high-impact aspect to their activity in the affordability area.

According to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, its 900 member co-ops serve 92% of US counties that come under the “persistent poverty” category, meaning that the population falling under the poverty level has reached the critical-mass level of 20%.

At that rate of poverty, these counties “experience systemic problems that are more acute than in lower-poverty areas,” according to a 2019 Congressional Research Service Report.

“Therefore, policy interventions at the community level (such as applying the 10-20-30 provision to other programs besides those cited in ARRA), and not only at the individual or family level, could continue to be of interest to Congress,” the report concluded.

The Community Solar Solution

Got all that? Good! That explains why the Energy Department has been working so closely with NRECA on solar affordability, and that brings us to the latest development.

Earlier this month, NRECA let word slip that it has received $1 million from the Energy Department to support the organization’s ACCESS (for Achieving Cooperative Community Equitable Solar Sources) program.

The ACCESS program “will leverage the experience gained through innovative cooperative initiatives to make solar energy accessible to LMI consumers,” as described by NRECA VP of Business Strategies Jim Spiers.

Specifically, NRECA has tapped six co-ops to deploy financial tools and other strategies that bring community solar projects to low- and middle-income households:

Anza Electric Cooperative (California): a 4-megawatt project with energy storage, for a tribal community and other low-income consumer-members.

Oklahoma Electric Cooperative: a 2-megawatt project to benefit the public school district in Norman, where about half of students qualify for subsidized school meals.

Orcas Power & Light (Washington State): a 1.25-megawatt project with storage, with a portion set aside for low-income members.

Roanoke Electric Cooperative (North Carolina): a program to leverage a community solar program to support energy efficiency upgrades, possibly with some philanthropic help.

Two of the six projects are TBD, so stay tuned for word from BARC Electric Cooperative (Virginia) and Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (New Mexico).

Kit Carson stands to be especially interesting due to its hookup with the firm Guzman Energy, which has figured out a way to help electric coops disentangle themselves from burdensome fossil energy contracts.

More (Big, Huge) Friends Of Affordable Solar Power

To make things even more interesting, the $1 million round of funding builds on an award of $300,000 that the Energy Department provided to NRECA last year, in support of the organization’s CARES (Cooperatives Achieving Rural Equity in Solar) project.

CARES is a best-practices initiative aimed at figuring out ways to improve access to financial resources for communities in need. To that end, NRECA recruited the coop-affiliated National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation and CoBank to serve as financial partners.

The two partners were tasked to “develop solutions that take advantage of financial assistance programs, guarantees and opportunity zone designations (where and when applicable) to make solar energy development more affordable,” and they are both involved in the new ACCESS project.

Also working in a continuing role from CARES to ACCESS is the California-based nonprofit organization GRID Alternatives, and that’s where things get really interesting.

GRID has been working under the radar since 2001, when two engineering professionals — Erica Mackie and Tim Sears — leveraged their private sector experience to launch a solar pipeline for low-income communities. Ahead of the Green New Deal, GRID also has job creation built into its DNA.

GRID popped up on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2013 for its triple play of renewable energy, low-income access to clean power, and job creation. It has been super-busy since then, one recent highlight being the addition of an energy storage component to its ongoing partnership with the leading solar firm SunRun.

Last summer SunRun also teamed up with Chanel — yes, that Chanel — for a $35 million solar job creation and solar access program, which is designed to reach about 30,000 low-income California residents.

For those of you keeping score at home, yet another partner in the ACCESS project is the Energy Department’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. That’s interesting on account of the lab’s energy storage work, in addition to its solar expertise.

The lab could also facilitate a ripple effect on low-income access to distributed wind power, of which it is a big fan.

In another interesting twist that demonstrates how quickly the renewable energy ecosystem is developing, last summer SunRun hooked up with AutoGrid for cloud-based virtual power plant services across the US, leveraging SunRun’s growing fleet of residential batteries.

Interesting! If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.

Written in collaboration with Deya Zavala of Mile High Connects and Katie McKenna of Enterprise Community Partners (MHC steering Committee Member).

Our homes, workplaces, and other buildings are often the foundations of our sense of comfort and community—they are also foundational to climate action. A recent analysis from GridLab, NRDC, and Sierra Club illustrates the extent to which Colorado must phase down carbon emissions from homes and other buildings in order to meet its climate goals. At the same time, it’s critical we expand our focus beyond simply reduced emissions. Colorado policymakers must embrace equitable, transformative housing and building policies in order to appropriately respond to and prepare for the increasing unaffordability, displacement, and health impacts of the climate crisis.

Colorado leaders should take advantage of a transitioning building sector to invest in healthier infrastructure for the state and help all Coloradans fully transition to a clean energy economy. For many, buildings are the closest relationship we have with our energy use and climate impacts. Buildings are the main sources of our energy expenses and the structures we depend on to keep us safe during climate-intensified heat waves, cold snaps, storms, and pollution. Buildings have also been a wealth generation tool at the heart of racial and economic inequity in this country. Efficient all-electric buildings are a proven, least-cost tool for eliminating carbon emissions from buildings, but they are only as effective to the extent we can make them accessible. If low-income communities and communities of color are unable to afford them, we will not reach our climate goals and we will leave those communities to pay for the aging gas infrastructure left behind. Policymakers have an opportunity to build sector policy that gets at the interlocking crises facing Coloradans which will be key to achieving sustained progress against climate change for all.

Colorado Context

Direct fuel use in buildings is responsible for 10 percent of Colorado’s climate-warming carbon emissions, and electricity use for buildings is responsible for another 16 percent. Much of that carbon comes from burning fossil gas (otherwise known as natural gas) inside our homes for water heating, space conditioning, and cooking. Carbon emissions and other pollutants from burning fossil gas in buildings are harming our planet and our families.

In order to get on the path to cleaner, healthier buildings that support the state’s climate goals, Colorado must transition away from building, homes, and businesses that depend on fossil fuels as soon as possible and prioritize climate-friendly renovations for buildings in low-income, historically under-resourced, and Black and Brown communities.

What Our Modeling Tells Us We Have to Do

As part of our report, Evolved Energy Research and Physicians, Scientists, and Engineers for Healthy Energy modeled and analyzed pathways for Colorado to meet its climate goals. Our analysis showed the stark contrast between a business-as-usual “Reference” scenario and one in which state policymakers ensure we meet our climate targets—the “Core” decarbonization scenario. We found that, absent new policy, pollution from buildings is likely to grow in Colorado and be unequally distributed. The state must act quickly to reverse this trend.

The report lays out three major strategies to cut pollution from Colorado’s buildings fast enough to meet the climate goals:

Accelerate adoption of efficient, electric appliances in homes and offices; Ensure new buildings are highly efficient and fully electric as soon as possible; and Upgrade existing buildings to make them more efficient.

As part of these three strategies, the state must ensure that low-income households, rural communities, and renters reap the affordability, health, and comfort benefits of energy efficiency and electrification.

Efficient Electrification

Confronting the climate crisis requires a transformation of the building energy use from fossil gas to clean electricity. Highly efficient, electric options are available for heating and cooking appliances, which currently rely heavily on fossil gas, but adoption of these electric options is not expected to accelerate at the pace required to meet the climate goals without new policy.

Our modeling found that efficient, electric appliances must make up half of new space and water heaters in residential buildings and a third of new heaters in commercial buildings by 2030—up from a little over 20 percent of residential heater sales and less than 10 percent of commercial sales today. And that’s assuming almost complete decarbonization of the power sector by 2030. If the state continues to burn coal or a sizable amount of gas for electricity in 2030, then buildings will have to electrify even more quickly to help make up the emissions difference, with electric heaters making up 90 percent of sales in residential buildings by the end of this decade.

The study also found that buildings are a major source of PM 2.5 pollution, exceeding PM 2.5 emissions from power plants and vehicles in Colorado. These emissions are most substantial in rural areas where wood is burned for home heating.

As the state weans buildings off fossil gas, policies to support electrification of low-income households are crucial. Low-income residents face several barriers to electrification, including the high upfront cost of electric heat pumps and a lack of incentives for landlords to upgrade their rental housing units. If electrification lags in low-income communities, these communities are likely to shoulder the cost and burden of the remaining fossil gas infrastructure and pollution, exacerbating energy costs for people who already tend to spend a large share of their income on energy.

Figure: Energy Use for Buildings

Note: Pipeline gas is methane that is delivered to buildings via the gas distribution system. Today, that gas is entirely fossil gas, though the small amount that remains in 2050 may be replaced with synthetic gas in a deep decarbonization scenario.

Ensure New Buildings Are Efficient

Colorado’s residential building stock is expected to grow 16 percent by 2030 and 45 percent by 2050. Ensuring that these new homes are highly energy efficient and fully electric as soon as possible is critical to meeting our climate goals.

New buildings must be built with efficient building shells and efficient appliances from the start. Construction of new buildings must shift so that new homes are entirely or almost entirely built with efficient shells in the coming years. And more than 80 percent of new appliances (in existing and new buildings) must be energy efficient by 2030, up from less than 10 percent today.

Upgrade Existing Buildings

The state also needs to improve existing buildings with efficiency and electrification to meet the climate goals—these measures are key to ensuring equitable outcomes. Many Coloradans live in leaky or poorly insulated homes that waste energy, are uncomfortable, and exacerbate health issues. However, with improved building efficiency and electrification, occupants can see improvements in asthma, allergies, mold, and pests.

Our analysis shows that the state should upgrade 1 to 2 percent of homes per year over the next decade and more than 2 percent of homes per year after 2030 in order to meet the climate goals. If policymakers go even further on home retrofit programs, they can save Coloradans even more money on their energy bills, as shown by our “Low Demand” scenario. To achieve a bold program that retrofits every home in the state by 2050, Colorado should begin retrofitting almost 3 percent of homes per year this decade and more than 4 percent per year in the 2030s and 2040s.

The state also needs to move at a pace of replacing 2 to 3 percent of non-electric space heaters per year with efficient, electric ones in the coming years.

Figure: Residential Buildings With Efficient Building Shells

Our analysis also shows that investing in energy efficiency upgrades and electrification can cut energy burden for Coloradans, but in order to bring cost-saving improvements to the households that need them the most, policies must be designed to assist low-income communities in replacing their appliances and upgrading their homes.



Figure: Energy Burden in Modeled Scenarios

Getting on the Right Path

Policies for putting the state on the right path will include adopting building codes that move toward all-electric new construction, creating performance standards for existing buildings, and increasing electrification programs to help Coloradans purchase and install efficient electric appliances.

Through building codes, we have learned that the easiest and cheapest way to abate GHG emissions from buildings is to build clean from the start and avoid the costs of gas infrastructure. Specifically, all-electric construction is more affordable because it eliminates the need to connect gas lines, install gas meters, and pipe gas into the building. Putting in place building codes for all-electric construction will be critical to ensuring future buildings are part of the solution rather than part of the problem.

For existing buildings, we must focus on improving efficiency and electrifying. An existing building performance standard can require certain buildings to meet minimum energy or carbon efficiency requirements by a given date as a way to drive innovation and improvements over time. As for electrification, utilities can play a crucial role in developing electrification programs that provide incentives and simple strategies to help homes and businesses upgrade to electric heating, cooling, and cooking.

It is essential that all policies ensure Colorado’s low-income communities and communities of color are able to participate and benefit from these programs. This will require a process that is not only inclusive and equitable, but that specifically targets communities that have historically been burdened by high energy costs and pollution and unable to access clean energy programs. The processes must also work alongside fossil gas utility workers and their unions to reduce the impact to their jobs and support a transition to building and installing clean energy technology. This is an opportunity to take climate action in a manner that lifts up impacted communities and plans for addressing past inequities and preventing future burdens.

Crafting Building Policy in the Midst of an Eviction Crisis

Colorado—like the nation as a whole—is facing a housing and eviction crisis exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Before the pandemic, 50 to 59 percent of renters in the Denver and Grand Junction metropolitan areas were cost burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for housing. In 2017, 38 percent of Coloradans were either living in poverty or were considered asset limited and income constrained. The pandemic worsened these underlying crises, driving unemployment rates to more than 12 percent in the state, leaving many renters unable to pay rent and utilities, and putting between 400,000 and 600,000 Coloradans at risk for eviction by the end of the year. This puts us in the midst of compounded coronavirus, climate change, and housing crises. Colorado leaders must protect all communities during the pandemic and beyond with an extension of the eviction moratorium, protections against displacement as a result of building upgrades, new policies to expand affordable housing, and opportunities to build wealth generation and ownership of homes and land among low-income communities and communities of color. These can include addressing the loopholes in the CDC eviction moratorium such as minor lease violations, lease terminations, and month-to-month tenancies. The state can also require landlords to support tenants by providing information on rental and legal assistance and reasonable repayment opportunities before an attempted eviction or collection, and to apply to Property Owner Preservation assistance before they can evict for nonpayment. Finally, late rental fees should be suspended until at least the end of 2020.

Building-sector climate policies are not only much harder to achieve in the context of rising housing insecurity and poverty, but also are at risk of deepening these crises without proper affordability protections, an expansion of tenants’ rights, and new frameworks for housing policy. Building shell upgrades and replacement of old appliances tend to increase the value of homes, driving up property values and rents and potentially leading to evictions and displacement. An advisory council could help prevent these negative impacts by bringing tenants rights’ and housing equity representatives as well as residents, workforce development organizations, representatives from labor unions, retrofit program implementers, joint labor-management apprenticeship programs, workforce training centers, and contractor associations into the planning process. The council can co-design solutions to avoid displacement and unaffordable housing and support green jobs.

By listening to those who are currently being impacted by unaffordability and pollution and those who will be impacted by the transition, we can ensure the development of concrete anti-displacement protections, affordability protections, and high quality job retention or creation. Only then can we build a just and equitable low-carbon economy.","Much of that carbon comes from burning fossil gas (otherwise known as natural gas) inside our homes for water heating, space conditioning, and cooking.

As essential service providers, utilities are responsible for helping to ensure the health and well-being of our communities. The weight of that responsibility has gotten heavier as climate change and the pandemic take its toll on our beautiful state and the people who live here.

As summers become hotter, droughts longer, forests drier and wildfires more destructive, pressures are also mounting on the electrical system – the backbone of our economy and quality of life.

It’s unimaginable that the world’s fifth largest economy is worried about keeping the lights on, when many California businesses are already struggling for survival because of COVID-19. For example, the pandemic has decimated our state’s restaurant industry, which has generated more sales tax revenue than any other industry, nearly $7 billion annually. It has similarly devastated California’s craft breweries, which contribute $9.01 billion annually to the state’s economy and pay more than $906 million in state and local taxes.

Many of the 90,000 restaurants owned by independent proprietors and 1,050 craft breweries are fighting to stay afloat. About 1.5 million workers in these industries are also struggling to make ends meet. Additionally, more than 50% of California’s restaurants and craft breweries are owned by people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by our worsening climate.

Recent rolling blackouts – the root causes of which were identified in a newly released report – were yet another reminder of how critical a reliable energy system is to our economy and the ability to keep vital businesses open, generating revenue and providing jobs.

For California to rebound economically and successfully address the growing severity of climate change, a cohesive and effective roadmap to achieve cleaner, safer, more reliable and affordable energy is required:

More renewable energy and flexible generation. California will continue to excel in producing renewable energy. But we must solve how to make use of the oversupply of solar power produced mid-day. Parallel investments in long-duration energy storage, fuel cells and existing natural gas power plants, which over time can be converted to more clean fuels like hydrogen and renewable natural gas, are key. Natural gas infrastructure backs up renewables and is an affordable second energy system, especially for the state’s restaurant industry. Decarbonizing it while creating more resiliency means the lights stay on when the sun isn’t shining or the wind blowing. Let’s also take a look at using more demand response technologies that conserve energy when demand is the highest. As an added benefit, CO2 emissions are reduced at the same time.

A safer, more resilient electric grid. Additional innovation, technology implementation, strategic undergrounding and ongoing enhancements to continue to operate safely matters. Why? Consider that 90 million metric tons of carbon dioxide have been emitted so far this wildfire season. By comparison, the entire electric system produces approximately 60 million tons of CO2 annually. Preventing wildfires means safer communities and better air.

Cleaner transportation. While in state electricity accounts for just 9% of emissions, transportation is woefully behind at 41% and must be addressed if we are to meet the state’s climate goals. Air quality will improve when we pick up the adoption pace of electric vehicles.

Affordable energy. Evidence of severe systemic disparities confirms that we must maintain affordability. By investing in research and deployment of new, cost-effective technologies, California leads in developing renewable electricity. Let’s do the same for the natural gas grid, transportation, agriculture, industry and buildings. No one technology or solution will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all these sectors and putting all our eggs in one basket isn’t practical or smart. California is a forerunner in the climate change fight and should make sure our climate policies can be replicated. Affordability is central to this.

The exact path to 100% zero-carbon electricity is unknown but must assure safety, reliability, resiliency and affordability. While we push to accelerate decarbonization, we must also strive to ensure the present survival and ultimately, the revival of our cherished California restaurant and craft brewing industries which help define our state’s unique character.

California is an innovation powerhouse. Now is the time for action. California needs to move more quickly toward cleaner, safer, more reliable and affordable energy outcomes.","By Kevin Sagara Kevin Sagara is chairman of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas, kevinsagara@sempra.com.

Candidate name: Anna Tovar

Political affiliation: Democrat

Position sought: Arizona corporation commissioner

City of residence: Tolleson

Career: Mayor of Tolleson; former teacher and Arizona legislator

With the election just days away, Cronkite News is profiling candidates on the Nov. 3 ballot. The five-member Corporation Commission, which was established by the Arizona Constitution, regulates public utilities and decides rate adjustments, assists incorporation of businesses, enforces safety and public service requirements and approves securities matters.

Under the Renewable Energy Standard Tariff, which the commission adopted in 2006, energy companies are required to get 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2025 and charge customers for it through a fee on their bills. Would you change that requirement if elected?

Renewable energy is a key reason Tovar entered the race. Arizona needs to move forward to renewable energy and create clean jobs, but she wants to make sure the costs don’t prevent communities of need from utilizing renewable energy at their homes or businesses.

Tovar wants to protect consumers, making sure the concerns of everyday Arizonans are heard.

What would factor into your decision to grant or deny a rate hike for a utility company?

As described in Arizona’s Constitution, the commission is a quasi-judicial entity. Commissioners are required to act as impartial judges in cases before the commission, Tovar said, considering all the evidence presented to them.

“I don’t have an issue asking the tough questions and making sure my priority is putting Arizonans first.”

Her No. 1 priority is being a voice for Arizona families.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story included inaccurate information about Anna Tovar’s age. Cronkite News has not verified Tovar’s age, and the category has been removed from the candidate’s bio.

Is it appropriate for utility companies to disconnect services in extreme temperatures?

When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March, Tovar, as mayor of Tolleson, declared a moratorium on water shutoffs for unpaid bills. The city is working with customers and has set up a payment system that does not charge late fees.

Regulators, legislators and utilities need to be creative with policies so that Arizonans don’t have to choose between paying a bill or buying food for their families.

“We don’t want anyone to suffer that consequence of passing away because of the heat.”

Do you have concerns regarding the security of our election?

Tovar is confident the state has processes in place to protect the vote against fraud, and she noted that polling locations are putting COVID-19 safety measures in place.

Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and her office, she said, have been working diligently for the last two years to make sure that Arizona is free from out-of-state interference.

What is the greatest issue Arizona residents face? If elected, how would you address it?

COVID-19 and working to get through the pandemic stronger. Families are making difficult decisions every day, and the key is to have a plan of action and cohesive communication.

There isn’t a national or state plan on COVID-19, leaving mayors across Arizona to make decisions without a playbook. “As mayor, at times I feel that I am alone,” she said.

What other issues are important to you and your campaign?

Before COVID-19, Tovar campaigned across Arizona discussing the importance of the Arizona Corporation Commission and how it affects lives. Many people she spoke with were shocked that the corporation existed and had that much of an impact, she said.

“It is one of the most powerful entities here in the state that people know very little about. For me, I want to make sure that I am restoring trust and accountability to the commission, expanding on our renewable energy.”

What makes you the best candidate to hold this office?

Moving Arizona to clean renewable energy and creating healthier environments statewide is personal to Tovar, who in 2001 contracted a rare form of leukemia after exposure to an environmental toxin.

“I definitely don’t want a family, a child, a senior to go through a similar situation that I went through because of a toxin that entered my body that caused leukemia. Gratefully I am here today.”

What is a personal challenge you feel you need to overcome?

As a people person, it’s difficult to not interact in person with Arizonans because of the coronavirus and the restrictions in place to curb its spread.

The new products enable Mosaic's solar partners to offer the lowest rates in the market at a time when consumers are both increasingly cost-conscious and more aware of the benefit of buying rather than leasing their home solar and battery system.

""We can offer homeowners and installers market-leading loan products because the quality of our lending program continues to be rewarded by the capital markets with a lower cost of funding,"" said Billy Parish, founder and CEO of Mosaic. ""We are excited to pass that lower cost of funds on to our customers.""

""We will provide homeowners with the most affordable monthly payments anywhere,"" said Erin Talbot, chief lending officer of Mosaic. ""This new pricing, as low as 0.99 percent, brings the cost of the average solar project to less than $100 per month. It's another step toward our vision of 100 percent clean energy for all, and we encourage those homeowners debating solar or batteries to take advantage of our new PowerSwitch CHOICE loan pricing.""

Renewable energy assets are considered attractive to investors from Wall Street to pension funds. However, Mosaic's securitizations are attractively priced because of the high quality of the company's underlying residential solar loan portfolio and proven track record. Mosaic recently completed its eighth asset-backed securitization to date, and the $222 million offering was multiple times oversubscribed and placed with more than 20 unique investors.

This new pricing for homeowners comes just weeks after Mosaic announced the PowerSwitch ZERO loan program , the first-of-its-kind loan available for homeowners to convert to clean energy with no monthly payments for 12 months. All PowerSwitch ZERO loans are made by WebBank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender.

301,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-completion-new-affordable-housing-development-brooklyn,"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ny.gov,Governor Cuomo Announces Completion of New Affordable Housing Development in Brooklyn,"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced completion of the initial phase of The Fountains in Brooklyn, a 6.7-acre mixed-use development complex that will ultimately offer 1,163 affordable homes. Together, the first two completed buildings of the project include 332 affordable apartments and supportive services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities so they can live independently. The development is being constructed on the site of the State's former Brooklyn Developmental Center in East New York.

""We have made an unprecedented commitment to address the lack of affordable housing in every corner of New York, but especially in Brooklyn, where the financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been severe,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""Our aggressive approach to building new developments like The Fountains will provide high-quality, energy-efficient homes and supportive services to those who need them most as we continue to come back from this crisis.""

The Governor's commitment to providing all New Yorkers with access to safe, affordable housing is reflected in the State's unprecedented $20 billion, five-year Housing Plan. The plan makes housing accessible and combats homelessness by building or preserving more than 100,000 affordable homes and 6,000 with supportive services.

Designed to provide good quality, affordable homes to low-income households and those in need of supportive services, The Fountains is part of the Governor's overall strategy to revitalize communities and grow the economy. Since 2011, New York State Homes and Community Renewal has invested nearly $2.5 billion in Brooklyn that has created or preserved 11,800 affordable homes.

The first phase includes a new building at 11629 Seaview Avenue with 65 affordable apartments. Seventeen units will be reserved for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities who will have access to comprehensive onsite supportive services provided by the Block Institute, Inc. These households will also receive rental subsidies provided by the New York State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities. Ten units will be fully accessible and adaptable for residents with mobility, hearing or vision impairments.

Support for the $23.4 million Seaview Avenue building included an allocation of federal and state Low-Income Housing Tax Credits through New York State Homes and Community Renewal. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority's Multifamily New Construction Program awarded $158,600 for this project and also provided a total of $152,840 in NY-Sun incentives, including $53,120 from the Multifamily Affordable Housing Incentive for a 195.48 kW solar system. Additional financing was provided by Bank of America.

Another building, located at 911 Erskine Street, offers 267 affordable apartments for families. Sixty-seven apartments are reserved for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities who will receive supportive services from the Block Institute and rental subsidies through OPWDD.

911 Erskine Street was constructed under New York's Climate Bond program to drive the development of affordable housing that has a positive impact on the environment and climate. Both buildings were designed to meet the standards of Energy Star Multifamily High Rise and Enterprise Green Communities programs to achieve maximum energy efficiency. Energy efficient features include high efficiency condensing boilers and heat pumps, Energy Star appliances and photo sensors and timers to control outdoor and site lighting.

Financing for the $86.8 million building on Erskine Street included permanent tax-exempt climate bonds, federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and subsidy from HCR. Additional financing was provided by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

The Fountains is located close to public transportation, Shirley Chisholm State Park, bike trails and community resources such as grocery stores, parks, schools and other retail establishments.

The decommissioned State property, purchased through Empire State Development's competitive request for proposal process, is being developed by the Arker Companies. Under the terms of the sale, the Arker Companies paid $10 million for the property, which was previously owned by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. The property was part of the former state-run Brooklyn Developmental Center, which closed in 2015.

The Fountains complements Governor Cuomo's $1.4 billion Vital Brooklyn initiative which is targeting and investing in eight integrated areas, from health care to housing, establishing a new standard for addressing chronic economic and racial disparities in Brooklyn's high-need communities. The Vital Brooklyn initiative will create 4,000 affordable homes in Central Brooklyn's neighborhoods.

HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, ""The Fountains is an ambitious development that complements Governor Cuomo's ongoing efforts to bring energy-efficient, health-oriented affordable housing to Brooklyn. The 332 households in Phase One will benefit from supportive services, recreation space, nearby public transportation and many other important amenities for families. When complete, The Fountains will be a modern and active mixed-use and mixed-income neighborhood with more than 1,100 homes. We thank our many partners on this project for their remarkable efforts completing Phase One and we look forward to celebrating the completion of all six buildings.""

Empire State Development Acting Commissioner and President & CEO-designate Eric Gertler said, ""Empire State Development is proud to partner with our sister state agencies and the private sector to breathe new life into this underutilized state facility. Projects such as The Fountains not only promote local economic opportunity but also serve as crucial catalysts for broader neighborhood revitalization. Because of the skill, expertise and creativity of each partner, this development will generate the jobs, commercial activity, neighborhood services and additional benefits that will help in our mission to move New York Forward.""

OPWDD Commissioner Theodore A. Kastner said, ""New York has made great strides helping people with developmental disabilities to live independently in their communities with the right supports. The new apartments at The Fountains, built on the grounds of the former Brooklyn Developmental Center, show just how far we've advanced since the days of housing people with developmental disabilities in institutional settings. These new apartments will help more than 80 people with developmental disabilities achieve their goals of being supported within their community to live, work and participate fully.""

Doreen M. Harris, Acting President and CEO, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said, ""Helping our most vulnerable citizens have equitable access to clean and affordable energy is a priority of Governor Cuomo's climate agenda. This project demonstrates how healthier, affordable living spaces powered by renewable energy can enhance communities and help reduce harmful emissions for generations of New Yorkers to come.""

HPD Commissioner Louise Carroll said, ""When this six-building project is finished, families in East New York will gain access to hundreds of new affordable homes at a very critical time. Every new affordable home counts right now. As we push for more affordable housing, it's the projects like these, primarily serving low-income households and people in need of supportive care, that are becoming more important than ever. I commend our partners at Arker Companies, New York Empire State Development, and New York Homes and Community Renewal Development for bringing this development to life.""

Senator Roxanne J. Persaud said, ""I applaud the announcement of the phase one completion at 'The Fountains' bringing affordable housing to the residents of my Senatorial District. This much needed and anticipated project, especially now during these unprecedented times, is a welcoming addition to my constituency where affordable housing options are critical to New Yorkers and their families. New Yorkers deserve to have a place they can proudly call their home and I commend the private/public partnership between the Arker Companies, Empire State Development and Homes and Community Renewal to successfully bring this first phase to fruition and strive to improve the lives of residents of Southeast Brooklyn.""

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said, ""The first phase of The Fountains will provide stable, affordable housing to people who need it most. I was proud to offer testimony in support of this project, emphasizing the need to prioritize those at risk of displacement in the East New York and Brownsville areas. The complex's commitment to centering sustainability should also serve as a model for developments throughout our borough, especially as we continue to contend with the effects of climate change. I thank our partners at the City and State level for making this a reality, and look forward to celebrating the openings of the next phases soon.""

Scott L. Barkin, PhD, Executive Director of the Block Institute said, ""The homes being created by the Fountains phase one affordable housing project serve as a reminder of how challenges become opportunities. At Block Institute, we are dedicated to improving the quality of life for individuals and families of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and today we can take a moment to celebrate helping more New Yorkers through this new project. Block Institute is proud to join the Arker Companies, New York State and New York City in offering homes and support to individuals that will ensure the most independent and inclusive lives. This is where hopes and dreams become reality.""

Alex Arker, Principal at Arker Companies, said, ""During this unexplainably difficult time, people are just looking for a place to live and call home. The Arker Companies is grateful that the State and City worked with us on finalizing and opening The Fountains so we could begin moving families into this new development and help a few New Yorkers out. This is just the first two of six buildings, and we look forward to celebrating many more families moving in here over the coming months. Stable and affordable housing is so critical, especially during this hard time, but it is important to push for more affordable housing so every New Yorker can have a place to call home.""

Todd Gomez, North Region Market Executive in the Community Development Banking Group at Bank of America, said, ""The Fountains is tangible evidence of the important impact that affordable and supportive housing can have on the residents and neighborhoods of East New York and across the City. The Arker Companies' vision for and commitment to this multi-phased development will create much needed housing opportunities for residents while contributing to the growing, vibrant East New York community. We are delighted that Bank of America's $70MM in construction loans and $57MM in tax credit equity investments could help to support the first phase of The Fountains, and we look forward to the completion of future phases in partnership with the Arker team and the project's public sector sponsors.""","Governor Andrew M.

So I’m making sure that I’m really representing the entire state.” (Photo courtesy of Lea Márquez Peterson)

Candidate name: Lea Márquez Peterson

Political affiliation: Republican

Position sought: Arizona corporation commissioner

City of residence: Tucson

Age: Unverified

Career: Appointed to the Corporation Commission in 2019; former president and CEO of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce

With the election just days away, Cronkite News is profiling candidates on the Nov. 3 ballot. The five-member Corporation Commission, which was established by the Arizona Constitution, regulates public utilities and decides rate adjustments, assists incorporation of businesses, enforces safety and public service requirements and approves securities matters.

Under the Renewable Energy Standard Tariff, which the commission adopted in 2006, energy companies are required to get 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2025 and charge customers for it through a fee on their bills. Would you change that requirement if elected?

“It’s only a matter of time before the entire nation goes that direction. And it also makes Arizona more competitive with the states surrounding us,” said Peterson, who in a news release in March announced her support for “100% clean energy” by 2050. (“Clean energy” includes nuclear power, which does not produce carbon dioxide; “renewable energy” does not include nuclear.)

Peterson predicted dramatic changes to energy rules in the coming months and said discussions won’t be limited to renewable energy but also touch on such issues as energy efficiency and battery storage.

What would factor into your decision to grant or deny a rate hike for a utility company?

“For me, it’s really a balance between ensuring that a company has made an appropriate capital investment, that we’ve got reliable services and the affordability for the ratepayers.”

Financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic obviously has had an impact, she said.

“I hear from families all over the state about how challenging things are right now financially; whether they were furloughed, or a small business has suffered or they’re trying to recover. And so there is hypersensitivity to affordability right now.”

That sensitivity is a priority when she considers rate hikes.

Is it appropriate for utility companies to disconnect services in extreme temperatures?

It’s never appropriate.

“We’ve seen health crises. We’ve seen people die of extreme heat.”

However, that doesn’t mean people shouldn’t pay their power bills, she said. Customers should set up a payment plan with the utility or look into utility assistance programs available in each of the state’s counties.

Do you have concerns regarding the security of our election?

Although there has been some controversy about the Postal Service, she points to Arizona’s Permanent Early Voting List as something to alleviate residents’ concerns.

“I just went through a primary election and (it) was successful. And I believe the general election will work just as smoothly.”

What is the greatest issue Arizona residents face? If elected, how would you address it?

Economic recovery after the pandemic and lack of access to high speed internet.

She stressed the importance of having affordable, reliable utilities as well as the availability of utility assistance programs, especially when most are feeling the financial strain.

About a million people in Arizona do not have access to high speed internet, she said, which is a challenge for people working and going to school from home.

“As I talk to you, my children are upstairs, in high school and college, taking classes right from their bedroom. So we are very dependent on high speed internet.”

Programs should be put in place to ensure that low income families “have access to high speed (optic) fiber.”

What other issues are important to you and your campaign?

Peterson noted a “cloud of corruption” over the commission when Gov. Doug Ducey appointed her in May 2019. There was widespread public criticism of the commission following campaign finance scandals.

She said she proudly voted for a commission code of ethics that ensured “we are not taking funding or resources from people who are trying to influence us.” The code, she said, was important for the integrity of the commission.

Peterson is running as a “Clean Elections” candidate, which means she is not taking utility or other special interest money to finance her political campaign.

“I think what’s key in this election is we’ve turned a new leaf at the commission. From my perspective, it’s about integrity,” Peterson said. “It’s about this code of ethics and I’d like to even see it go further in the future.”

What makes you the best candidate to hold this office?

Peterson credits her experiences as a small business owner and her decade-long tenure as CEO of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. That helps her on the commission, which also incorporates businesses in the state.

In addition, she said, not being from the Phoenix area is an advantage.

“As I sit on the commission during these meetings, I can apply my business experience (and) my knowledge of areas outside Maricopa County. I’m the only commissioner not based in Maricopa County. So I’m making sure that I’m really representing the entire state and all the other 14 counties, (as well as) Maricopa County, in the state.”

What is a personal challenge you feel you need to overcome?

Getting up to speed on commission issues was a “steep learning curve” because Peterson doesn’t come from the energy industry. The detail and complexity of the cases were a challenge at first, but after 18 months, she’s comfortable.

“Constituents have seen that I have really weighed in and pushed and encouraged change.”

She also recognizes that COVID-19 has brought new challenges. In early September, she proposed a $50 million customer relief package for customers of Arizona Public Service, the state’s largest electric utility.

“We’re in the middle of a pandemic and it’s time that we might need to look at things in a different way. In this case, customer financial relief needs to be a priority for families.”

Please share a quote or advice that you live by

“Life is choices and consequences.”

The quote, something she often heard from her mother, aids her work on the commission. She’s aware of the power of every choice she makes and every vote she casts.

“I’m just really careful. And, you know, taking some risk where it makes sense to be innovative, but also making sure that I’m not negatively impacting families with any of the decisions.”

Modi was addressing the virtual India Energy Forum by CERAWeek.

Modi said India believed that access to energy must be affordable and reliable. “That is when socio-economic transformations can take place. We view the energy sector as one that empowers people and furthers ‘Ease of Living’,” he said.

Modi said transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas were required to ensure this. “For too long, the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster. We need to move towards responsible pricing,” said he.

He said India wanted to encourage domestic gas production and as part of its reforms had allowed for price discovery through the market. “They will give greater marketing freedom in the sale of natural gas through e-bidding. India’s first automated national-level gas trading platform was launched in June. This prescribes standard procedures to discover the market price of gas.” He reiterated plans to achieve ‘One Nation, One Gas Grid’ and shift towards a gas-based economy.

Modi highlighted the challenges that the oil and gas sector has faced this year. “Energy demand fell by almost one third. There has been price instability. Investment decisions have been impacted. Leading global bodies project that there will be a contraction in global energy demand over the next few years also.” He added, “But, these agencies project India to emerge as a leading energy consumer. India is set to nearly double its energy consumption over the long term.”

Commenting on India’s exploration and licensing policy, Modi added, “The focus has shifted from ‘revenue’ to ‘production’ maximisation. There is also focus on greater transparency and stream-lined procedures.” Modi reiterated plans to grow the country’s refining capacities from about 250 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) to 400 mmtpa by 2025.

Reiterating India’s global commitments towards a green transition, Mod said, “India’s energy plan aims to ensure energy justice while fully following India’s global commitments for sustainable growth. This means more energy is needed to improve the lives of Indians with a smaller carbon footprint.”

He said the target to increase the installed renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatt (Gw) by 2022 has been extended to 450 Gw by 2030. Modi added that India would continue its efforts to fight climate change despite having among the lowest carbon emissions, compared with the rest of the industrialised world.","Prime Minister on Monday emphasised the need for responsible crude pricing at the India Energy Forum, and said the country is looking to ensure energy justice.

Cuomo today announced that construction has begun on a new 55-apartment affordable housing complex in the City of Batavia, Genesee County. The $14.5 million development includes 28 apartments set aside for veterans who have a history of homelessness and who need supportive services in order to live independently.

""New Yorkers and their families deserve safe, affordable homes, and veterans who have struggled with chronic homelessness are no exception,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""This exciting new project in the City of Batavia will help our veterans who have given so much for our nation. Providing them and other area residents with new housing will provide comfort and financial security during a difficult time.""

""All New Yorkers, especially our brave veterans who served to protect us, should have a roof over their heads and the decency of a good home,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. ""This housing development in Batavia will provide affordable housing for people in the area, including veterans who have struggled with homelessness and need supportive services. Now more than ever, as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to make sure New Yorkers have the resources and services they need to live healthy and safe lives. This project in the Finger Lakes is part of our efforts across the state to build back better and more inclusive and enhance quality of life.""

Liberty Square is part of Governor Cuomo's commitment to providing all New Yorkers with access to safe, affordable housing under the State's unprecedented $20 billion, five-year Housing Plan. The plan makes multifamily housing accessible and combats homelessness by building and preserving more than 100,000 units of affordable housing and 6,000 units of supportive housing.

The development will rise on a site made vacant by the demolition of three derelict buildings on East Main Street. The new four-story Liberty Square will have 55 affordable apartments serving households earning 60 percent or less of the Area Median Income. Six of the apartments will be fully adaptable for people with mobility impairment and three separate units will be equipped for people with audio or visual impairment.

Twenty-eight of the apartments will be dedicated as supportive housing for formerly homeless veterans receiving services and rental subsidies through Governor Cuomo's Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative. Eagle Star Housing will provide supportive services and will have an office and counseling space on-site. The project's developer is Home Leasing.

There are eight studio, 39 one-bedroom and eight two-bedroom apartments. Shared amenities include a community room, a fitness center, private patios and balconies, secure interior bicycle storage, raised garden beds, a fenced playground, an on-site management office, on-site parking, and bulk storage incorporated into the apartments.

Energy efficiency and Green Building design requirements will be incorporatedthroughout the complex, including Energy Star appliances and fixtures in all apartments. This will allow certification under NYSERDA's Low-Rise New Construction Program and Enterprise Green Communities Version 2015 program.

New York State Homes and Community Renewal financing for Liberty Square includes federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits that will generate $10.5 million in equity and nearly $4 million from the Supportive Housing Opportunity Program. In addition, NYSERDA will provide a grant of $53,000 under its Low-Rise New Construction Program. Redstone Equity Partners is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits equity investor and Five Star Bank is providing construction financing for the project.

Since 2011, HCR has dedicated $604 million in the Finger Lakes Region to finance 95 multifamily developments, resulting in the creation or preservation of nearly 7,500 affordable homes, including 216 in Genesee County. HCR's investment in the region has leveraged $890 million more in funding from other sources.

HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, ""The COVID-19 pandemic has caused previously unimaginable harm and disruption, but it hasn't stopped the team at HCR from carrying out Governor Cuomo's mission to create, preserve and protect affordable housing across the state. It is intensely gratifying to see this essential work continue with Liberty Square - especially when the development dedicates 28 homes for our heroes, as this one does, and another 27 for families. I thank and commend the HCR team and our partners and look forward to welcoming the new tenants to this wonderful new building in Batavia.""

New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance Commissioner Mike Hein said, ""We have an obligation to ensure all New Yorkers have a safe, stable place to call home - especially those who have served in our nation's armed forces. Liberty Square will provide a fresh start for more than two dozen veterans in Genesee County, while breathing new life into a formerly derelict swath of East Main Street. Projects like this continue the work started by Governor Cuomo's landmark five-year housing plan and reaffirms New York's steadfast commitment to ending homelessness among our veterans once and for all.""

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Acting President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, ""Delivering the benefits of our green economy to all New Yorkers, especially our most vulnerable residents, is a hallmark of Governor Cuomo's clean energy transition and nation-leading climate agenda. Transforming neglected properties or sites into energy efficient and affordable homes with services for our nation's heroes who served in the U.S. military is something NYSERDA is proud to support and we look forward to the completion of Liberty Square.""

Senator Michael Ranzenhofer said, ""Investing in our region is extremely important. I am glad to see construction starting on this project. It is great to see the creation of veterans' housing, supporting those who served our county is imperative.""

Assembly Member Stephen Hawley said, ""Our veterans have given their all to defend their country, it's only right that we as a community continue to do our part for them and give them our all. With the construction of Liberty Square, I'mproud to see Batavia continue to find ways to take care of its people, and I eagerly anticipate the results of construction. But more so, I'm thrilled that our veterans will continue to find the support they so rightly deserve.""

County Manager Matt Landers said, ""I am very happy to see a project like this that benefits disabled veterans come to fruition. This country owes a great deal for the sacrifice made by our veterans and projects like this are essential in order to meet the needs of these disabled heroes.""

City Council President Eugene Jankowski, Jr., said, ""The City of Batavia welcomes Home Leasing as they provide the much needed veteran, seniors, and workforce housing to our community. Home Leasing has a positive history of building, maintaining and managing properties across upstate New York and this project will be a great addition to our city""

CEO of Home Leasing Bret Garwood said, ""Home Leasing is extremely proud to start construction of Liberty Square in Batavia and thankful to the community and our partners. Liberty Square will provide an excellent home for families and veterans as well as contribute to the vitality of Batavia.""

Zach Fuller, Eagle Star Housing Executive Director said, ""We are very excited to embark on this amazing project with Home Leasing in Batavia! We are continuously striving to better the lives of all Veterans that we serve. This project will deliver 28 much needed affordable apartments to our Veteran community. Eagle Star strives to provide the highest quality care and options for our Veterans and is looking forward to continuing our relationships with our community partners in the supportive City of Batavia. We thank everyone who helped make our vision a reality.""

Accelerating Finger Lakes Forward

Today's announcement complements ""Finger Lakes Forward,"" the region's comprehensive blueprint to generate robust economic growth and community development. The State has already invested more than $8.07 billion in the region since 2012 to lay the groundwork for the plan - investing in key industries including photonics, agriculture and food production, and advanced manufacturing. Now, the region is accelerating Finger Lakes Forward with a $500 million State investment through the Upstate Revitalization Initiative, announced by Governor Cuomo in December 2015. The State's $500 million investment will incentivize private business to invest well over $2.5 billion - and the region's plan, as submitted, projects up to 8,200 new jobs.

The suit, filed in Superior Court on Sept. 24, contends that SANDAG did not provide a fair hearing on the issue because it denied the city’s appeal on a weighted vote, meaning members that represented areas with large populations had more votes than small cities. In a one-city, one-vote tally, the appeal would have been heard.

The lawsuit was brought up at Friday’s SANDAG board meeting when some members said they were disappointed to learn that Executive Director Hasan Ikhrata approved the use of agency funds to fight the lawsuit after the proposal died when brought before the Executive Committee last month.

The suit claims small cities were disenfranchised when the board used a weighted vote to squash their appeal to a revised housing plan that dramatically increased the number of units they are expected to produce over the next decade.

Coronado City Manager Blair King said SANDAG’s new formula for allocating affordable housing in the county placed the city’s goal at 1,001 new units by 2029, an increase of 1,800 percent from its 2011 allocation of 50 units.

The allocation stems from the state’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment plan, with the latest update called Cycle 6. The plan dictates how many new affordable homes must be built in each of the 18 cities in San Diego County and in unincorporated areas.

The assessment calculated 171,685 new units in the county by 2029. Units were placed in four different income categories ranging from very low to above-moderate, and SANDAG was required to allocate the units among its member jurisdictions.

According to the lawsuit, Imperial Beach’s allocation increased from 254 units in the 2011 cycle to 1,375 units in the new cycle. Lemon Grove’s allocation increased form 309 to 1,359 units and Solana Beach’s allocation increased from 340 to 875 units.

The cities appealed to the board to adjust the allocation, but their request was rejected June 26. A tally vote had sided with the small cities, but the appeals were rejected by the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, Del Mar, Encinitas and National City in a subsequent weighted vote.

The SANDAG board approved the allocation plan a few weeks later. According to the lawsuit, a motion to approve the allocation failed in a tally vote July 10, but a motion that used a weighted vote passed with support from the city and county of San Diego, Encinitas, Carlsbad, Chula Vista and National City. Nine members refused to participate.

The lawsuit argues that the use of the weighted vote to consider the cities’ appeal was inappropriate.

By September, SANDAG staff members were expecting that the allocation and the voting process would be challenged in court.

At a Sept. 11 Executive Committee meeting, members were split 3-3 against transferring $100,000 from a reserve fund to defend SANDAG in a potential lawsuit regarding its allocation vote. At the time, no lawsuit had been filed.

“I think it’s a little bit premature to allocate funds for this,” said David Zito, a committee member and Solana Beach councilman.

He also noted that the lawsuit was to defend an action that the majority of the board had opposed, and he suggested that money to defend the lawsuit should come from the state.

“To be perfectly honest, I don’t think we should spend money defending that,” he said.

County Supervisor Jim Desmond, who is also a member of the committee, agreed that setting money aside would be premature.

“We don’t even have a lawsuit right now,” he said. "" If one hasn’t been filed yet, what are we doing here?”

He also agreed with Zito about whether they should spend their money defending the decision, since 14 out of 19 jurisdictions were against it.

The motion failed with Desmond, El Cajon Mayor Bob Wells and San Marcos Mayor Rebecca Jones voting against it and San Diego City Councilwoman Georgette Gómez, Encinitas Mayor Catherine Blakespear and Chula Vista Mayor Mary Salas in support.

At Friday’s SANDAG board meeting, Zito, Jones and Coronado Mayor Richard Bailey made some barbed comments directed at Ikhrata after seeing an informational item on the agenda noting that $56,000 had been transferred in the agency’s budget for legal fees related to a challenge to the housing allocation, despite the earlier Executive Committee decision.

“If any of our city managers took this type of action against the wishes of majority of board members, none of us would stand for it,” Bailey said. “In my opinion, this further erodes the integrity of the organization and if unchecked, continues to consolidate power away from the elected representatives that rep the 3.3 million residents of San Diego County and into the hands of one person. I don’t believe we should tolerate this type of activity.”

Jones said Ikhrata’s action “further erodes the confidences many people will have in our organization.”

Ikhrata defended using SANDAG funds while also saying he did not go against the Executive Committee’s direction from September.

“The Executive Committee did not authorize the use of that fund, and we honored that decision,” he said, referring to the September vote on reserve funds. “No direction was given regarding any other funding source regarding the lawsuit in general.”

Jones and Desmond said they were at the Executive Committee meeting and recall that the discussion was not about whether to use reserve funds, but whether to fund defense of the lawsuit at all.

Ikhrata again defended using agency funds in the lawsuit.

“I believe I would not be doing my job if I did not take the action I did,” he said. “You took an action as a board, and I’m defending that action. And somebody needs to defend the agency. I would expect many of you to be angry at me if I didn’t.”","The allocation stems from the state’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment plan, with the latest update called Cycle 6.

Posted Tuesday, October 6, 2020 12:54 pm

The Las Cruces City Council, at its Monday, Oct. 5 meeting, approved a Resolution establishing an affordable housing development agreement between the City and Tierra Del Sol Housing Corporation. The agreement will lead to the construction of 32 affordable housing units on a 4.49-acre parcel, known as the Sierra Tract, just east and south of Sierra Middle School.

Construction of the estimated $3.2 million project could begin as soon as February 2021.

To be built on the Sierra Tract will be 8 single-family homes, 12 townhomes, and 12 apartments. Amenities will also include a walking path and a community garden. The council also asked for easy access to Sierra Middle School for children living in the subdivision and nearby neighborhood.

The City acquired the Sierra Tract property from the Las Cruces Public Schools in trade for a road improvement project on Bruins Lane through a mutually beneficial agreement. Construction of Sierra Tract will provide much needed affordable housing for Las Cruces residents.

The City conducted a series of meetings, in August and November 2018, that engaged surrounding neighbors of the Sierra Tract to provide their input on the potential development of the site. Input and comments received from those meetings led the City to initiate a Community Planning Blueprint for the subject property.

A Community Planning Blueprint is a plan that promotes the vision of the City's Comprehensive Plan and serves as a policy guide for City Council, the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City's Affordable Housing Land Bank and Trust Fund Advisory Committee, City staff and the public. The Blueprint guides the development of the parcel to create a quality, innovative, affordable housing development that will be conscious of the concerns of the existing surrounding developed area and will meet the needs and desires of the City.

Additionally, City Council adopted the Las Cruces Climate Action Plan. The actionable and aggressive plan will guide the municipality and community in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 73 percent by 2050 – based on the 2018 baseline. This work expands on many of the Elevate Las Cruces Comprehensive Plan policies in the areas of energy management, community, and transportation planning, building design standards, and waste minimization.

With the adoption of the Climate Action Plan, the City’s Sustainability Office will work with City departments and stakeholders to develop specific policies and actions that ensure an equitable climate transition.

Goals of the Climate Action Plan include:

An overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 19 percent or greater (of the 2018 baseline) by 2030 including reductions using renewable energy (of 11.9 percent); alternative and clean transportation (by 11.7 percent); waste minimization (2.1 percent) and decarbonization of energy in buildings (1.7 percent). An overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 73 percent or greater (of the 2018 baseline) by 2050, including reduction using renewable energy (28 percent); alternative and clean transportation (44.5 percent); waste minimization (6.7 percent) and decarbonization of energy in buildings (16.7 percent). Establish parallel or more ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets within municipal operations by 2030 and 2050.

Details of the Climate Action Plan can be found at: https://lascruces.civicweb.net/document/9670/A%20RESOLUTION%20TO%20ADOPT%20THE%20LAS%20CRUCES%20CLIMATE%20AC.pdf?handle=9EA9B950DC604E4BA053D69E7BE8E48C.

The City of Las Cruces is a local leader on climate action and is committed to creating a healthier, more sustainable, and greener future for all community members.

In 2019, the City embarked upon multiple efforts to better understand the impact on climate change and identify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation strategies, while working to enhance community equity. This work was facilitated by Lotus Engineering and Sustainability, LLC and has included developing the City’s first community-wide and municipal GHG emissions inventories, a strategic stakeholder engagement process to develop GHG reduction strategies relevant for the community, and modeling the emissions reduction potential associated with the selected strategies.","CITY OF LAS CRUCESPosted Tuesday, October 6, 2020 12:54 pmThe Las Cruces City Council, at its Monday, Oct. 5 meeting, approved a Resolution establishing an affordable housing development agreement between the City and Tierra Del Sol Housing Corporation.

307,https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/21/tesla-needs-these-affordable-localized-mass-market-models/,"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CleanTechnica,"Tesla Needs These Affordable, Localized, Mass-Market Models","In Q2’s conference call, Elon Musk noted: “The thing that bugs me the most is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that.” For those of us who have paid attention, we have seen the first of this new breed of affordable Tesla vehicles. I am thinking of course of the Cybertruck. It is the best selling vehicle type in North America, but a niche product in the rest of the world.

In order for the market to transition to fully electric vehicles, we need a suite of fully electric vehicles that families will buy to serve as their only, or main, car. So, a car with a 45 kWh battery will not suffice, even though it covers 95% of car usage scenarios, because it cannot take a family on vacation more than 150 miles away.

The challenge is that the new, affordable car needs to be a real Tesla. Not only being amazing, but offering a better value for money. Tesla autos are never slow. Tesla autos have ample range. Tesla autos appeal to a large public. Tesla autos are not copy & pasted from the 13 dozen models of legacy automakers just tweaked with different taillights. They are really designed for function. Last but not least, Tesla automobiles can be used as robotaxis.

Besides being a real Tesla, these new localized models should have a sticker price about the same as or lower than the competition and a body shape the local market prefers. The first that meets all of these criteria is the Cybertruck, tailor-made for the pickup truck segment of the North American auto market. It is one of the most affordable double cabin pickup trucks in the market. Also, it is one of the most versatile for work or leisure.

To answer all the critics who will point out that a vehicle like the Cybertruck with a price tag between $40,000 and $70,000 before options is not really affordable, note that I am using the word “affordable” for when the vehicle is the same price as the model it is competing with / trying to replace. I know it is not affordable to a hamburger-flipping high school student, or a single mom working two full-time jobs (or 3+ part-time jobs) just to feed her kids. But neither are any of the current models in the dealers’ showrooms. And a number of the models proposed below will cost less than $25,000. That is a price clearly in the “affordable” range of new car buyers.

Europe

For Europe, there are three models needed. Like the pickup is a staple for the American market, the following three are typical for Europe. They are: the large luxury station wagon in the D-segment and E-segment; the iconic Golf-type hatchback in the subcompact C-segment; and a smaller A- or B-segment (super) mini car that can also be used as the standard robotaxi and carsharing vehicle.

The first that Tesla should make is a Model 3/Y class station wagon. Simplest would be a Model Y with a prolonged roofline like the Audi, BMW, and Mercedes station wagon versions of their sedans have. The Model 3 roof is too low for this modification. Call it the Model B(rake) or Model W(agon). It needs the bigger 4680 batteries introduced on Tesla Battery Day for the extra range and power. The first high-capacity production line for these batteries will likely be in Brandenburg, so that should not be a problem. Towing capacity of 7700 pounds (3500 kg) is needed, with the range staying above 200 miles while towing. In the Netherlands, for example, one in nine families owns a caravan. They use their car to tow it to their holiday camping ground. The availability of a roof rack for transporting luggage, bicycles, building materials, or a ski box is also mandatory. This version would outsell the Model Y and the Model 3 in Europe, probably even the Models Y & 3 combined.

Second, Tesla needs a real hatchback. It should not be a more aesthetically pleasing, aerodynamically fastback like the Model Y and many coupes. Preferably, it would be in the style of a Volkswagen Golf, with a CUV sister like the Renault Captur. As a dealer once explained, a CUV is a hatchback with 2 inches of extra ground clearance, one inch more head room, and a $5,000 higher price tag. This should be the €25,000 model mentioned in the Battery Day presentation. It should have the towing and roof-rack options of the bigger Model B/W station wagon. Get it to market in early 2023 and Tesla owns the EU market.

Third, we need an A- or B-segment auto. These small so-called “city cars” are what private buyers buy the most in Europe. While the marketing suggests otherwise, they are not city cars at all, but simply small vehicles popular by mostly elderly people. They can offer the luxury of a new car without paying through the nose. They are used for shopping, driving 1–3 miles in the vicinity of the house, and visiting friends and family in the same or nearby cities. Don’t be surprised to see a usage pattern of 300 times 2 miles (3 km) and 50 times 150 miles (240 km). And the reason to buy is the 50 journeys outside the city.

Carmakers are looking to make small BEVs that are only able to operate within a large city like Paris. We need real Tesla cars in this segment of the market. Ease of use, range, fast charging, and Autopilot. Only 0–60 mph is less important. The mandatory tow hitch is mainly to transport bicycles. The micro MPV form factor is the most practical, but often also the ugliest. If Tesla can reinvent this class with the storage capacity and ease of getting in and out packaged in something that looks good, Tesla will earn our everlasting gratitude.

This small vehicle should also be the robotaxi or carsharing vehicle for Europe. Small and versatile are perhaps the most important characteristics.

China

The Chinese market is different from the European one. Many of the Chinese buyers of luxury sedans like the Model 3, Mercedes C-Class, or Volvo S60 can also afford a chauffeur. They like a longer model with more room in the back. The European competition puts an “L” behind the segment designation, like the Mercedes C-Class L. They are just 4 inches longer (wheelbase 3 inches) than the regular models. But it is a lot for the people in the back seats. Gigafactory Shanghai should start by building the Model SL and XL, followed by the Model 3L and YL. When Full Self Driving becomes available, the room in the back becomes even more important.

What the hatchback Golf type is for Europe, the Volkswagen Jetta/Bora or Nissan Sylphy/Sentra is for China. It is a small, subcompact (C-segment) family sedan. Towing capabilities and a roof rack are probably less important than in Europe. Those features are more for the lower-end utilitarian models, the very small and low-cost vehicles just above the motorized rickshaw. In Europe, these features are luxury holiday features. In other countries, they are often seen as the workman’s tools. The C-Segment sedan is a status and luxury item. It should not have attributes that suggest it is a means to get work done, like a van. This should be easy for Tesla. Just a smaller Model 3 and smaller Model Y.

I think Tesla should stay away from the Chinese A- and B-segment. There are a multitude of offerings for often very low prices. Tesla would be a super luxurious offering in these segments, but there are likely not that many buyers for super luxury in this part of the market.

USA

Beside the Cybertruck, the USA market can also use a lower cost fully electric passenger car. What they need is something a bit higher in SUV and CUV form than the current offerings. The SUV should be a boxier form, like what the Japanese are offering. I am thinking of the Toyota RAV-4 and 4Runner or the Mitsubishi Outlander. These should be in the same C-segment where VW is offering the ID.4. The shrunken Chinese Model 3 and Model Y are probably also welcome in the USA market.

Tesla

With factories and design centers in all three main markets, Tesla is creating the means to tailor its products for each market. It is clear from comments by Elon Musk that Tesla is going to do it. How Tesla is going to do — this will be fascinating to watch.

Trust Tesla to invent the wheel again. But only after studying all wheels made by the competition. With that statement, I mean that Tesla will look for an original way to be more efficient than Volkswagen in building many different vehicles using the same basic components. These will be great competitors to the Volkswagen ID.3 and ID.4 based on the Volkswagen Groups’s MEB platform in the same C-segment. Unfortunately for Volkswagen, the Tesla models will likely be a bit more advanced technologically and a bit more competitive in price. Volkswagen will win on customer loyalty and designing closer to what the customer is used to.

After the initial one-size-fits-all market approach practiced with the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla should start to make variations on the base models to satisfy the strong desire of many car buyers for certain types of vehicles. It should not result in the hundreds of sub-models and versions available from BMW and Mercedes, but the current crop is too small and spartan to keep the dominant market share Tesla’s technical excellence has conquered.

For the production volume Elon has mentioned for 2030, about 20,000,000 vehicles per year, you have to win many very different customers with different needs and different tastes.","We need to fix that.” For those of us who have paid attention, we have seen the first of this new breed of affordable Tesla vehicles.

With temperatures dropping across the country and winter less than two months away, you’re likely going to spend more time indoors, and your air quality might be top of mind. Air purifiers are an increasingly popular means to that end. In our guide to the best air purifiers of 2020, the president of the nonprofit Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America told us we spend about 90 percent of our time indoors and take 20,000 breaths a day on average. ""If you live in an area with high outdoor pollution, like a metropolitan city, it’s essential to monitor the air quality in your home,"" he continued.

With an increasing number of Covid cases across Europe and America, you may feel compelled to finally grab an air purifier and keep it on hand. Keep in mind that, as we reported, air purifiers do not prevent the spread of coronavirus. They excel at cleaning up your air, which is significant for anyone spending more time indoors now and in the coming months: According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the air inside our homes can be more polluted than the air outside.

You can find air purifiers at various price points across major retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. Or Consider buying directly from brands such as Molekule, Bissell, Honeywell and Dyson, four Shopping reader-favorite brands. Most air purifiers are pricey, especially given large spaces. But there are some highly-rated and popular air purifier models that will run you $100 or less, usually sacrificing the size of the area getting cleaned. To help guide your shopping to affordable-and-top-rated air purifiers, we compiled some of the top options that are currently in stock and ready to ship.

Toshiba, a popular purveyor of TVs, created a smart air purifier that's Wi-Fi-capable and boasts Amazon Alexa compatibility, a UV light sanitizer that helps kill airborne bacteria and emits a low level of noise — 32dB at its lowest setting, which the company says is similar to that of a white noise machine. The air purifier can handle rooms as large as 222 square feet, relying in part of its HEPA filter, or “high-efficiency particulate air” filter, which is designed to filter at least 99.7 percent of particles that are .3 micrometers or larger — experts recommend going with HEPA-equipped air purifiers.

The Core 300 combines proprietary Vortexair Technology, which the brand claims help filter pollutants more efficiently, with a true HEPA filter. Like other three-filter systems, the Core 300 also boasts a pre-filter and a carbon filter to help neutralize odor. The air purifier is designed for rooms that are 200 square feet of space, and is Energy Star-certified, meaning the EPA considers it an energy-efficient product. While the White model costs just under $100, you’ll have to shell out an extra $60 for the Black air purifier. Levoit claims the purifier is also notably quiet, emitting just 24dB of noise, which is the noise equivalent to a whisper or rustling leaves.

TaoTronics makes a quiet air purifier — it emits only 25dB in its sleep mode — that helps clean rooms up to 161-square-feet-large. It includes a pre-filter, carbon and HEPA filter. Beyond the 4.8-star average rating from more than 4,800 Amazon reviews, it also has a nightlight feature to add some non-air-purifying value to the unit.

Looking to purify your space but also want to enjoy the calming scent of lavender or energizing smell of citrus essential oils? Consider adding the PartU air purifier to your shopping cart. In addition to the three-filter system — pre-filter, HEPA and carbon filters — there is a fragrance sponge built in: Add an essential oil (or several) and the purifier will help fragrance up to 107 square feet of space. You have three fan settings to choose from — low, medium and high — along with a lock screen that prevents curious children (or pets) from changing the purifier’s settings.

With more than 23,000 reviews on Amazon and a 4.6-star average rating, Germ Guardian is the most popular air purifier on this list. Beyond a pre-filter, the true HEPA filter targets pesky pet dander, mold, allergens, dust and germs. There’s also an optional UV-C light that you can activate to help kill bacteria. A third charcoal filter is partially helpful for those who want to neutralize unpleasant odors from pets and smoke. If you’re having a hard time sleeping, then you may be intrigued by the built-in white noise machine, too. According to the National Sleep Foundation, a white noise machine (also called a sound machine) “can help you create a more relaxing bedroom environment that promotes healthy, high-quality sleep.”

In need of an air purifier but have a limited budget? Enter the Jinpus air, which costs roughly $35, is quiet (less than 30dB) and is designed to circulate your air faster, courtesy of the brand’s 360-degree Purification Performance, fancy for a fully rotating fan build. The purifier boasts a HEPA filter and its sleep mode powers down your gadget after eight hours of use —you can push a button to turn on the dim blue night light. Jinpus says the filter should be replaced every six months, so while you’re shopping, consider ordering a backup filter just to be safe. While this model checks all of our boxes for editorial consideration — highly-rated and costs under $100 — it’s worth noting the Rigoglioso air purifier is very similar to the Junpus version, as you can see in the product images for both. They both have the same noise level, HEPA filtration system, nightlight and sleep mode, as well as nearly the same amount of Amazon reviewers.

Bissell’s highly-rated Myair purifier features a 3-in-1 filter — pre-filter, carbon and HEPA filters. The carbon filter is particularly helpful for pet-owners, as Bissell says it will also help neutralize pet odors, as well as general house odors. There are two speed options — high and low — along with a sleep mode for whisper-quiet purification overnight or while attending virtual work meetings from home. It also weighs a little over 4-and-half-pounds so it’s easy to move from your home office to your bedroom if you choose. Just remember, the small purifier only works in areas of up to 100 square feet, so if you’re looking for a purifier for a larger space, consider ordering the Myair multi-pack or investing in a more expensive model, such as the Bissell Air320 that purifies up to 320 square feet.

Brad Sherman's Affordable Housing Solutions for the SFV,"Before becoming a Congressman in 1997, Rep. Brad Sherman was stuffing envelopes before elections.

“I got hooked on politics at a very young age,” he tells Inside the Issues.

What You Need To Know Democrat and incumbent Rep. Brad Sherman is up for re-election in California’s 30th Congressional district against Republican Mark Reed, a small businessman and rancher



Rep. Sherman has been in congress since 1997, but his love for politics started when he was a young boy because his mother was an activist



The Congressman would like to work on improving housing for his constituents and is concerned over foreign interference in elections

His mother, who recently passed away at the age of 91, was a political activist before he was born, and Rep. Sherman has been interested in politics ever since.

“By age seven, she had me stuffing envelopes, long ago before machines were so good at it. I worked for Congressman George Brown again and again. When I was eight, 10 and 12, and then I got to serve with George when I got elected to Congress and I began my service 1997. George was the first member of Congress to vote against staying in the Vietnam War,” he said.

Known for his self-deprecating humor and as an ode to his baldness, Rep. Sherman’s trademark is to hand out combs with his name on them, something he got from his mother, as well.

“My mother, she would hand out combs, not just in a campaign year, but all the time. She handed out over 100,000 combs,” he remembered. “She made a hundred thousand friends.”

One of the issues Rep. Sherman has worked on throughout his time in Congress has been fighting for housing rights.

“I remember the first campaign I was involved in. The issue was, believe it or not, open housing. There was actually a question on the ballot as to whether it would be legal to refuse to rent or sell a home to someone based on their ethnicity. Thank God we've come a long way since then,” he said.

This year, the congressman is up for re-election against Republican Mark Reed, a small businessman and rancher, for the congressional seat in California’s 30th District.

Rep. Sherman said he would like to see a solution to the homelessness crisis that his constituents are facing and said steps need to be taken to provide buyers with more options to purchase a home.

“That means a higher conforming loan limit so that even if your home sells for more than half a million dollars, you can still get a loan through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. That keeps interest rates lower and is critical to home values in the San Fernando Valley because if, when you sell your home, the buyer to get a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac conforming loan, they can afford to pay the the prices that people are asking for and if not then, even if the housing price goes down, the payments would go up. So, we want to keep housing payments down, we want to keep home values solid,” he said.

He supported the Heroes Act, as well as its revised version of the legislation, that he said would provide “tens of billions of dollars” to help those who are affected by COVID, especially when it comes to housing.

“The problem we have here is not Democrats who aren't responsive to the incredible needs that people have during this crisis,” said Rep. Sherman. “Instead we've got a Republican party that refuses to seriously discuss. We’ve got President Trump who has pulled out of the negotiations, then tries to rejoin, then pulls out again, one tweet after another. If we had passed the Heroes Act we would be much, much further toward being able to deal with the housing needs of both of those who were homeless before this crisis and those who face homelessness, or economic difficulty because of it.""

""I've got the bill to put sanctions on the Russian government by preventing Americans from investing in Russian sovereign debt."" pic.twitter.com/VPeS0sMBvH — Inside the Issues (@IssuesOn1) October 28, 2020

Rep. Sherman is also concerned about past and potential foreign interference in elections.

“I think everybody needs to be advised: Don’t believe everything you see on the Internet. If you don’t know where it comes from, it may be coming from St Petersburg. Second, if you don’t sanction Russia for what they did to us in 2016, they’re going to do more,” he said. “And we have not had any sanctions on the Russian government. We’ve sanctioned a few individuals, we’ve told a few hackers that never leave their basements in St. Petersburg, that they won't be able to visit Disneyland. They don't care. I've got the bill to put sanctions on the Russian government by preventing Americans from investing in Russian sovereign debt. That will raise their borrowing costs by probably three-quarters of a percentage point.”

“Our failure to do that, and Republicans have opposed it, means that you don't sanction Russia for what they do to our elections, then they provide weapons to the Taliban to kill our forces, and secretary Pompeo admits they did that, and then they put bounties on the heads of our soldiers and there’s some conjecture as to whether they did it quite that way but they certainly provided the weapons to the Taliban who want to kill American soldiers, anyway,” he continued. “If you let Russia interfere in our elections, and you oppose sanctions for that, you get dead American soldiers and you get further interference in our election. We still need to respond to what Russia did to us in 2016.”

ATLANTA, Oct. 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monarch Private Capital, a nationally recognized tax-advantaged investment firm that develops, finances, and manages a diversified portfolio of projects that generate both federal and state tax credits, is pleased to announce the financial closing of low-income housing tax credit equity (LIHTC) for a 50-million-dollar affordable housing development called Valencia Pointe in San Diego, California.

Located at 5930 Division Street in San Diego, California, Valencia Pointe will consist of 102 multifamily apartment units with affordable rents in place for households earning 40 to 80 percent of the area median income (AMI). Plans include 58 two-bedroom and 44 three-bedroom units in a single residential building. The development is expected to be available for rent in the second quarter of 2022. To bring the project to fruition, Monarch partnered with CRP Affordable Housing & Community Development, a full-service, vertically integrated real estate firm, and Hunt Capital Partners, a national syndicator of Federal and State Low Income Housing, Historic and Solar Tax Credits.

This new affordable housing development would not be possible without The California Housing Finance Agency and their 2019 preliminary awards to eight mixed-income multifamily housing developments, including Valencia Pointe. The awards come from Senate Bill 2, the Building Homes and Jobs Act, which provides a permanent funding source for affordable housing in California. As the state with the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless in the United States at an astounding 64 percent, this bill addresses a major affordability crisis in the state. The funding goes to existing state programs that provide assistance for emergency housing, multifamily housing, farmworker housing, homeownership for very low and low-income households, and down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. The eight projects receiving funding for 2019 will create 1,379 homes for low and moderate-income households, 102 of which make up Valencia Pointe.

“Monarch is committed to providing affordable housing in California,” said Brent Barringer, Managing Director of LIHTC at Monarch. “We’re very excited to partner with CRP and Hunt Capital on Valencia Pointe to help satisfy the growing need for quality affordable homes in the San Diego area.”

San Diego, California, is the second-largest city in the state and the eighth largest in the nation, with nearly 1.3 million residents within the city’s limits and over 3 million residents across the county. With 70 miles of breathtaking beaches, the many attractions of the world-famous San Diego Zoo, and various parks boasting unique art and culture installations, San Diego attracts all types of people. As a major tourism spot with a lot to offer, the city is finding a greater need to develop more affordable housing opportunities for its residents.

Not only will the new development address the city’s need for affordable housing, but in the initial year alone, the project is expected to create over 100 direct and indirect jobs and generate nearly $12 million in local income. The economic and social benefits will continue to impact the area in the years to follow.

“At CRP Affordable, we believe all individuals deserve a safe and secure place to live no matter the circumstance,” said Seth Sterneck, Vice President at CRP Affordable Housing & Community Development. “Valencia Pointe will help make this belief a reality, providing 102 families and individuals with new, high-quality affordable homes and an enhanced quality of life.”

312,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/del-mar/story/2020-10-22/del-mar-wants-affordable-housing-at-fairgrounds,"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The San Diego Union-Tribune,Del Mar wants to build affordable housing at fairgrounds,"The Del Mar City Council approved a formal request this week to build affordable housing at the state-owned fairgrounds on the city’s border.

“We are targeting at least 51 affordable units on the fairgrounds,” Councilman Dwight Worden said at Monday’s Del Mar City Council meeting. “If we could get more than 51, I think we would go for that.”

It could take three years to work out an agreement with the 22nd District Agricultural Association, which oversees the property, on details such as the location, financing and management of the proposal, Worden said. However, Del Mar has built none of its state-mandated affordable housing and faces sanctions if it does not get started.

The 22nd DAA board of directors, also known as the fair board, was informed of the request at its meeting Tuesday. But because the issue was not on the agenda, the directors’ discussion was limited and they agreed to schedule the matter in the future.

“This is not an interim use,” said Director Michael Gelfand. “This is a permanent use of a chunk of property owned by the 22nd DAA.”

Under the most recent allocation of the state housing law, Del Mar needs to build a total of 175 units including 113 units for residents classified as various levels of low-income. Del Mar is the smallest city in San Diego County, with about 4,400 residents and little land left for home building.

“We need to show some progress,” said Mayor Ellie Haviland, in support of the request to work with the fairgrounds.

The median value of a home in Del Mar is $2.5 million, according to Zillow. That makes the cost of buying or renting in the coastal city out of reach for many people such as school teachers, police officers and service industry workers.

Del Mar has talked with the fairgrounds officials before about building affordable housing but so far it has not worked out, Worden said.

“We as a city do not have any zoning control over the fairgrounds, and we don’t own any of that property,” he said.

The idea of housing may be more appealing to the fair board now than it has in the past.

The fairgrounds faces a financial crisis because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the cancellation of this year’s San Diego County Fair and other large gatherings that bring in most of its revenue. The fairgrounds laid off more than half its full-time employees this month after giving them several months notice.

Also, earlier this year the governor said that all available state properties should be examined for ways they could be used to help alleviate homelessness.

The fair board considered a plan to install temporary modular housing for the homeless at the fairgrounds. That idea died over the summer after facing extensive community opposition.

The request approved unanimously Monday by the City Council would give the city and the fair board about three years to investigate issues such as financing, permits, environmental issues and management terms for the housing. The most likely locations are on the fairgrounds perimeter, at places such as the fire station or recreational vehicle lot, where the housing would be accessible to the public without requiring residents or guests to cross other parts of the property.

Del Mar has contacted Solana Beach and San Diego about the possibility of participating in the housing effort, Worden said. So far, neither one has made a commitment. Both cities also need affordable housing credits.

Another possibility sometimes discussed is that Del Mar could annex part of the fairgrounds property to get credit for building the affordable housing, he said. But annexation would require approval from the Local Agency Formation Commission, and it may be possible for Del Mar to get its housing credits without it.

City Manager C.J. Johnson advised the council that because of the COVID-19 budget pinch, it could be difficult for city staffers to find the time needed to work on the housing idea.

“We have severe staffing constraints,” Johnson said. “We might have to look at spending money on a consultant with some targeted expertise ... without that it would be a challenge.”

One way to reduce costs may be to bring Solana Beach or San Diego into the project and have them share the work or the expense of a consultant.","The Del Mar City Council approved a formal request this week to build affordable housing at the state-owned fairgrounds on the city’s border.

313,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/governance/how-can-delhi-provide-affordable-housing-near-transit-to-its-poor-73619,"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Down To Earth Magazine,How can Delhi provide affordable housing near transit to its poor,"India’s capital and other metros have performed woefully in this regard, even as their global counterparts have progressed

Millions from lower-income groups throng Delhi every year for a secure livelihood. Many, arguably a majority, are hardly able to earn enough to eek out a decent standard of living at the National Capital’s exorbitant rates.

Housing, especially, is expensive and many are forced to put up in slums and shanties of ‘Jhuggi Jhopdi clusters’. Apart from being unhygienic, these are also mostly far from workplaces and away from affordable commute options.

Delhi, which is already suffering from a housing shortage, must build and upgrade around 4.8 million houses by 2022, to house a third of its population that lives in sub-standard housing, including 695 slums and Jhuggi Jhopdi Clusters, 1,797 unauthorised colonies, old dilapidated areas and 362 villages .

This target needs to be worked on hand-in-hand with Delhi’s strategies to provide better and accessible urban transport to its residents. Here lies the role of public transportation.

Public transport (Metro and bus) in Delhi caters to around 68.36 lakh trips on a daily basis. But how much of it is within reach of the poorest section of the society is still fuzzy. An unskilled daily wage labourer, earning Rs 534 daily, has to spend 22 per cent of their income on the Delhi Metro, according to a study by Delhi-based non-profit, Centre for Science and Environment.

That is 12 per cent more than the ideal amount (ie 10 per cent of the income for low-income groups) which he should be spending. Going by the same rule, as much as 34 per cent of the city population is excluded from non air-conditioned bus service.

Combining tranport and housing

While public transportation is already unaffordable for low-income groups, accessibility to it is another major issue, especially in low-income areas such as Sangam Vihar and Maidan Garhi, where public transport cannot reach. In view of this, a para-transit service named as ‘Gramin Seva’ was initiated in 2011 by the Delhi government to improve first and last-mile connectivity.

Currently, a total of 6,153 Gramin Seva vehicles operate in the city and cater to an average daily ridership of 80,000 approximately. There is no doubt that this service was one of the major stepping stones towards improving accessibility of poor. But is it the only best solution in today’s context, where Delhi is continuously expanding?

The answer is a big no. There needs to be a shift from placing the urban poor away from transit and then trying to solve the problem by improving their accessibility. Rather, house the poor near transit through provision of affordable housing, along with improving accessibility of the rest who live away from it.

This will reduce their overall journey cost by cutting down the transport expenditures on excess and egress service and improve their quality of life by providing them better living conditions near transit.

Unfortunately, the poor are often thrown away from transit plans. The Master Plan for Delhi 2021 came up with what planners called ‘in situ redevelopment’ in which, poor people are resettled in multi-storey apartments near shanties, instead of giving them plots for constructing houses on the city peripheries.

Still, the city authorities preferred relocation. Ahead of the Commonwealth Games in 2010, a big relocation exercise involving eviction and resettlement of slums or JJ clusters took place. The dwellers were relocated to 11 sites in north, northwest and west Delhi, including Bawana, which is in Delhi’s periphery and lacks public transport connectivity.

The concept of transit-oriented development (TOD) talks about social equity by reserving affordable housing near transit. In May 2017, the Government of India adopted the National TOD policy for guiding states and cities who want to adopt TOD as an urban growth strategy.

But no city, including Delhi, has taken any significant step. The discussions of TOD in India often get limited to increased floor area ratio (FAR) and density and rarely reach till housing near transit for all income brackets. In contrast to this, many global cities have even progressed up to implantation of innovative strategies for promoting affordable housing near transit.

Los Angeles, for instance, through its Metro Joint Development Policy has aimed at creating 35 per cent of the Metro’s housing affordable and make affordable housing developers to avail discount of land value up to 30 per cent fair market value, proportional to the number of affordable units to be created.

Till date, the initiative has created over 2,000 units of housing, of which, 31 per cent are affordable. The city of Minneapolis in Minnesota has reduced minimum parking requirement in high rise apartments through changes in its zoning regulation. It decreases the cost to developers and households, which increases opportunities for low-income groups to purchase or take a dwelling unit on rent bases near the transit areas.

Since the changes made in parking regulations in 2015, there has been an increase in the apartment buildings near transit outside the downtown area. The county of Arlington in Virginia allows developers to exceed the allowable FAR near transit in exchange of meeting affordable housing requirement.

Denver, Colorado, provides loans to affordable housing developers through its Acquisition Loan Fund to purchase and hold sites for five years within a half-mile and quarter-mile of anticipated rail and bus stations respectively. It helps these loan borrowers to compete with buyers who do not have provisions for affordable housing in their plans. The loans made to-date have created a pipeline of 1,300 affordable homes, a new public library, and well over 100,000 square feet of supportive commercial and non-profit space, all near public transit.

Delhi has now begun work on a master plan for 2041. This is an opportunity for city authorities as the implementation of mass transit projects such as Regional Rapid Transit System and phase-IV of the Delhi Metro have also begun.

The spread of Delhi Metro is already soaring the real estate prices in areas having easy access to the Metro network. For example, in Nirman Vihar Metro station, which became operational in January 2010, the land prices have gone up to Rs 7,200 per square feet in the mid of 2011, from approximately Rs 4,000 per square feet in 2010.

They rose to Rs 8,100 per square feet in 2012 and remained stable till 2013. Though there must be a number of factors due to which the price escalated from 2010-13, the impact of the Metro would certainly be one. Given this, the inclusion of affordable housing norms in the upcoming master plan is critical to provide it with legal backing.","Rather, house the poor near transit through provision of affordable housing, along with improving accessibility of the rest who live away from it.

Doris Bedinger keeps the door to her apartment open often.



“It’s not unheard of for three or four of us on the same floor to have our hallway doors open,” she said. “Just sort of a continuous flow, like we’re living in this big hotel with multiple suites all attached.”



But Bedinger doesn’t live in a traditional apartment. Her home is the Burlington Co-Housing community, a 32-unit cluster of homes in the East Village that blurs the line between a neighborhood and an apartment building.

Each household has its own private indoor unit, but the community shares the same outdoor space, common areas and responsibilities.



“It’s integrative, and it encourages people like me, who kind of come from kind of an individualistic American background, to think much more cooperatively,” said John Patterson, another resident of BCOHO.



Burlington Co-Housing is just one of the innovative solutions that are emerging lately for the affordable housing problem. And the problem is both broad and deep.



In the midst of the Covid crisis, housing advocates and government officials are worried about the immediate future of affordable housing and preventing homelessness. But the concerns about housing in Vermont — what’s available, how people can live there, and at what cost — have been decades in the making.



Champlain Housing Trust is one recipient of a $37 million housing bond in Vermont, with the goal of building 550-650 units in the next few years — at an average cost of $62,000 a unit. But Chris Donnelly, director of community relations at the housing trust, said that work is only a small part of the solution.



“Affordability in Vermont hasn’t changed that much in the last four years, even though we’ve made the biggest investment in affordable housing production we ever have,” Donnelly said.

According to the state government’s assessment of 2020 housing needs, nearly 90,000 renters and homeowners — 36% of all households in the state — pay 30% or more of their income to cover their housing costs. That 30% threshold is considered the maximum a household can handle. And 39,000 households (16%) spend more than half of their income on housing.



On the annual one-night count of the homeless population in January 2019, 1,089 Vermonters were homeless, and the length of stay in Vermont’s homeless shelters reached an all-time high in 2019.



In addition, the report said, at least 19,054 Vermont households live in homes with serious housing quality issues.



Some new ideas

Vermont is building fewer new homes for homeowners and renters, according to the 2020 state report. Housing experts say the cost of construction, particularly in weather-worn northern New England, is a big barrier to getting new affordable housing.



At the same time, demand is rising, particularly in the Burlington area — one of the few pockets of the state with a growing population and new jobs, at least before the pandemic.



“Everybody wants to live in Burlington because it’s close to jobs, it’s close to social life, it’s close to transportation,” said Kirby Dunn, head of Homeshare Vermont.



In confronting Vermont’s housing issues, some people are rethinking the concept of home.



For instance, Mikéla Sumner, a Vermont native who’s an architect, recently published a research thesis, “Adapting Home: Residential Development and Domestic Comfort in Vermont.” It proposes a new type of development in Williston, based around adaptable housing.



“Affordable housing is a basic need of life and yet an incredibly complex topic,” she said via email. “While it is a form of architecture we interact with every day, it has been eclipsed by the one-off civic, commercial and residential projects that generally garner more attention and acclaim.”



Sumner believes homes should be designed and redesigned to fit the needs of homeowners, able to change over time as the needs change. Now, she says, Vermonters force themselves to fit into the commonplace single-family standalone home, both economically and socially.



Her thought experiment is a development in Williston, a suburb of Burlington with increasing development centered on standardized, single-family standalone homes.



“These houses break down community, are grouped inefficiently, and detract from the existing local character,” she said. “It is crucial to provide an alternative means of housing that favors privacy while strengthening the community’s identity.”



She proposed an alternative: A neighborhood built around a flexible home design.



“People are different, and live differently, and should have the ability to customize their housing based on these differences,” she said.



Shared and flexible housing

Beneath the radar, flexible-living programs have been around for decades. Homeshare Vermont, which operates in seven central and northwestern Vermont counties, is in its 39th year.



The program brings together two types of Vermonters with different needs: Those who are looking for an affordable place, and can find it by living with people who have homes but want companionship or help around the house, said Kirby Dunn, executive director of the program.

Dunn herself has been sharing her home for roughly a decade. At first, she was caring for her aging mother and took in a renter to help with housework.



“I was just run ragged and couldn’t sort of keep track of everything that my life required, so I had somebody to help me with the household pet while I focused on my mom,” she said.



Now, it’s the social side: “I think I would have gone nuts during Covid if I didn’t have somebody else in the house,” Dunn said.



In return for their work, the renters get a place to live at a below-market rate. The renters pay an average of $314 a month, and one-fourth of them pay no rent at all, depending on their arrangement.



Homeshare doesn’t dictate the arrangement, instead gathering both groups of people, screening them and matching them up depending on what they’re looking for, Dunn said.



Companionship is a particular goal for homesharers who lived alone. In Vermont, 18.7% of homeowners live alone, compared to 14.5% nationally.



Designing for a solution

Home design may help to address the social issues with Vermonters aging in place.



Sumner’s housing proposal is based on accessory dwelling units — apartment-like living spaces that are attached to a main house or on the same property, essentially expanding on the idea of a mother-in-law apartment.



The design also gives homeowners the option to adjust their home over time. New homeowners can start with a small home, then build additions or adjacent structures that provide space for their growing family or aging parents.



“Here is a possible scenario of how these three parts are utilized,” Sumner said. “A young woman purchases a home, she gets married, has children, the children grow up and move out, she retires, and she and her spouse age and eventually require live-in care. The adaptable home can handle and adapt to these changes.”



Her design is based on the Side Hustle House, an adaptable home design created by Union Studio in Providence, Rhode Island, where she now works.

Joel VanderWeele, a Union Studio architect and one of the Side Hustle designers, said he was inspired by his own experience as a young professional struggling to afford his first home.



The Side Hustle has a easy-to-build, box-like design that is meant to be changed and adapted to fit the needs of the homeowner, he said.



“If in a moment of, you know, trying to stretch the dollar, or if you have a home health worker, or if you just want to create an additional unit within the existing home, you can do that without tearing apart the house completely,” he said.



Developers and designers have struggled to reconcile the demand for affordable housing with a painful reality of New England: Construction costs are very high. There’s a shortage of labor, particularly during Covid, and material costs are skyrocketing, he said.



But the adaptable home has two advantages. First, its options for changing over the life of the home lead to long-term savings, he said.



“It is going to serve the needs of people for a long time, so that after the upfront expense of new construction is paid off, it can still be usable, flexible, lovable and durable,” he said. “And then that contributes to the affordability equation long term, even if at the beginning, it’s not what most people would consider affordable.”



The second is that it allows for different configurations of Vermonters — young people, families of different sizes, and seniors — to fit comfortably within one household rather than being forced to change themselves to fit their space.



It’s not entirely a new idea. The traditional New England home often had those shifting conceptions of auxiliary dwelling units and home additions, VanderWeele said.



“The life cycle of a typical New England farmhouse: It’s sort of a compact, around 1,100-square-foot cottage form, that can serve as a two-bedroom house, one bedroom with an office, it can also accept a side attachment and a rear attachment of bedroom, workshop, garage, whatever, and can even be turned into multiple units,” he said.



Dunn said Homeshare Vermont has begun promoting the concept of an auxiliary dwelling unit “as an alternative, or as a support way of having a homeshare with a little more privacy.”



Housing, big and small

The key to tiny homeownership, says Erin Maile O’Keefe, is to “keep it clean all the time.”



“If you make a mess, you’re tripping over it,” she said.



O’Keefe moved into a tiny home after she realized her old family camp home in Brattleboro was unlivable. Now she and her husband live in the Paper Boat, a 300-square-foot home built in 2018.



O’Keefe, an artist and organizer, runs the annual Tiny House Fest in Burlington, where people drive in with their own tiny homes, and where panel discussions and events are planned around them.



Her advice to people considering the tiny home lifestyle: “You cannot spend enough time on design.”

“Consider how you live every day, you and whoever else is living with you,” she said. “How do you move in the space? I think about it as the choreography of your day, and really examining yourself and examining what you need, and being really realistic about what you need, and what is something you can let go of.”



At first glance, tiny homes seem very different from the co-housing model, which can combine dozens of people. BCOHO is one of about half a dozen co-housing projects across Vermont, including communities in Bristol, Hartland and the Mad River Valley.



Some communities have religious or political affiliations, but many are simply people looking for a different way of living.



Patterson, the BCOHO resident, said it’s not for everyone — you have to be willing to contribute to making the community work.



“There are people who really like to have things done for them, and if they’re able to afford to have things done for them, then they just expect that, and those people would tend to have a difficult time in co-housing, because it’s a different mindset,” he said.



Yet it’s a mindset that an increasing number of tiny homeowners are adopting, O’Keefe said. Tiny home communities, where individual tiny homes share one piece of land, have cropped up across the country, and one of O’Keefe’s colleagues just started planning one in Vermont.



“It’s really harkening back to how we used to live as humans,” she said, in contrast to “the feeling of disconnection that we’ve been going in, that direction of spreading out on the landscape and creating bigger houses.”



More people, less space

In a way, tiny homes and co-housing both try to fit more people in less space. VanderWeele noted that home size has increased 50% since the 1960s.



“We have not enough homes for the number of people who need them, but arguably too many bedrooms, or many unoccupied bedrooms, in homes that are too large for the household,” he said.



Still, tiny homes and co-housing communities struggle to be truly affordable for low-income Vermonters. O’Keefe warned that building costs for tiny homes are higher per square foot than traditional homes, because you need to set up the same infrastructure in less space.



Don Schramm, one of the founders of BCOHO, said many co-housing communities across the state aren’t particularly affordable. BCOHO has some affordable units thanks to the Champlain Housing Trust, which helps to subsidize the cost, lowering it to more affordable levels.



Bedinger is one of the residents who has benefitted from those affordable units. She sold her house in Kansas to move to the Burlington area to be close to family, but quickly realized housing costs were far higher than she was used to.



The grants from Champlain Housing Trust allowed her to live in a community that she says fits her lifestyle well. “I think I’m a really good fit here,” she said.

Donnelly skepticism

Before the Covid crisis, almost a third of Vermonters couldn’t afford housing, defined as spending more than 30% of their income on their home, according to Census data.



The pandemic only worsened the issue. With record-high unemployment and increasing financial trouble for everyday Americans, the state has swooped in with rental assistance to avoid a cascading crisis for tenants and landlords.



Elsewhere in the country, advocates call a boom in evictions its own epidemic, as families across the income spectrum find themselves homeless for the first time. The federal Centers for Disease Control called for an eviction moratorium, but it stands on shaky ground, leading to uncertainty over the future of millions of renters.



So it’s not surprising that, when discussing creative solutions to affordable housing, Donnelly — of Champlain Housing Trust — admits he was a skeptic.



“I like to say we’ve been building tiny houses for years — we just stack them all together in one big building,” he said.



Along with subsidizing housing costs, the trust builds new affordable housing, runs those developments, and helps people looking for housing to find homes there.



Americans love the idea of living in their own home “on their own little piece of land,” he said. But the reality is many low-income Vermonters, or even middle-class Vermonters, can’t save enough money to buy or build a home.



“In this country, our housing policies are backwards,” he said. “We subsidize people like me who own a home; I get a guaranteed subsidy, because I can deduct my mortgage on my taxes. When you rent a home, only one in four people qualify for any assistance.”



He also worries when developers use terms like “regional character” as a goal for designing a home or neighborhood.



“The use of character, in terms of architecture, has been used as a way to zone out people that are ‘undesirable.’ And we see that in multifamily housing. Certainly, I’ve seen it in suburban areas where they were worse than redlining.”



Particularly in Vermont, where towns are attached to their own histories, “the word character has been used in zoning regulations as a way to say, well, that’s just not what we’re like here in terms of the architecture, and then that segregates our communities,” he said.



“You know, when people are used to living in a tent, or on the streets, they don’t really think about what the outside of their building looks like that much when they find a home,” he said.



A sense of place

VanderWeele said there’s a value to subsidized affordable housing and conventional apartment buildings that try to lower design and construction costs.



But he believes a sense of place — that regional character — can also be important, even in affordable housing.



“I think human health values stability, and stability is sort of tied up in a sense of rootedness in place,” he said. “I think it’s important long-term to balance these things.”



The regional character associated with Vermont has practical value, too, he said. The state’s first architects didn’t design pitched roofs because they were pretty, but because they were best in heavy snow.



From the different camps of fixing the housing crisis — those in favor of subsidized housing, or deregulation, or financing, or zoning — VanderWeele is in favor of a “broader solution.”



“From design, to financing, to zoning regulations to federal housing programs, I think all of it needs to be used at the same time,” he said. “Because housing, what people think of as necessary for their own housing situation, is different for so many different people.”

Manufactured construction is the process of creating buildings or building parts in a factory and assembling them on-site like Legos. Because manufactured and modular (a type of manufactured construction) construction can cost 20-30% less and speed up construction timelines by 50%, the industry has grown over 34% since 2015, according to Census data.

“I’m watching new technologies emerge — panel construction, modular housing… There are some interesting things that are happening in the construction industry that are driving down costs,” said Byron Carlock, U.S. real estate practice leader of London-based professional services network PwC, which released its Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2021 survey report last week.

The average manufactured single-family home cost $55,200 in May 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, less than a fifth of the typical $330,000 price tag on a U.S. home, according to May 2020 Realtor.com data.

Price advantages prompted U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson to make modular homes a major agenda item during his term. Carson prescribed deregulation of manufactured housing as a solution to America’s affordable housing crisis during his “Driving affordable housing across America” bus tour early this year.

“Today we’re proposing changes that remove more of the red tape that stands between the production of safe, quality homes, and the nation’s families and individuals that need these homes to make homeownership a reality,” said Carson on a tour of a Clayton Homes modular housing factory in Russellville, Ala. in February.

Affordable and mid-priced housing is more in-demand than ever before, as the coronavirus pandemic drives migration to the suburbs across the U.S. new home sales were up over 32% in September compared to the same time last year, driving home prices to a median $350,000 in September, up 11.1% compared to the same time last year. Builders are actually trying to slow sales to keep pace with incoming orders.

“The answer is new and affordable housing. The question is how do we get there efficiently. And I’m pleased to see the industry taking leadership roles to try to do that,” said Carlock.

‘Pandemic will nudge firms toward modularization’

The industry was already ripe for change before the coronavirus pandemic. Construction has suffered a labor shortage since the Great Recession of 2008, and labor costs, material costs and labor availability were still the top three developer complaints in 2020, according to PwC. But manufactured construction allows companies to build houses where labor and supplies are most accessible.

“I think with more prefabrications, trying to do more in a controlled environment, in a shop, some companies are working towards that and less on-the-job work. [They’re] more in control in the factory,” said Jarrett LiBuono, a consultant at New York-based CREtech Global Innovation Consulting Practice, at the CREtech consulting talk webinar on October 20.

The coronavirus pandemic only added to the practicality of moving construction indoors, where processes are systematized and often automated. Thousands of construction projects were delayed during the pandemic because of disrupted supply chains, regulatory shutdowns and continuing labor shortages — delays that could have been mitigated in a controlled environment, according to analysts.

“The coronavirus pandemic will likely nudge firms toward modularization and prefabrication of components. Assembly line efficiency and the controlled environment of a construction ‘factory floor’ can bring cost savings with higher efficiencies in labor productivity and shortened project schedules,” said the Deloitte 2020 engineering and construction industry outlook.

Rockport Mortgage Corporation provided the FHA Section 223(f) loan.

Situated on 5.32 acres, the development overlooks the Hudson River with views of the Manhattan skyline. A 10-minute walk from Port Imperial ferry terminal, the asset comprises two 24-story buildings as well as a one-story maintenance storage building, a five-story parking garage and one ground floor commercial space.

Of the property’s 688 residential units, 684 are covered by a project-based Section 8 HAP contract. As part of the refinance, LIHC has agreed to enter into a new, 20-year mark-up-to-market Section 8 contract. At the expiration of the contract, LIHC will extend it a further 19 years, ensuring the property will remain affordable through 2059.

“We are pleased to partner with Rockport on this major refinancing effort and to commit Parkview Towers to 39 more years of deep affordability under Section 8,” Andrew Gendron, a principal of LIHC Investment Group, said. “So far this year, we’ve extended affordability protections for 1,790 units across six properties in New York and New Jersey thereby providing peace of mind for vulnerable adults and families. This is particularly important in today’s environment as the ongoing pandemic has revealed the true scarcity of safe, clean, and affordable rental homes in communities across the country.”

Rockport was familiar with the property, having also provided the previous round of financing.

“We’ve had a relationship with this borrower for a while and we actually provided a loan on this property in 2016,” John Dromey, a senior vice president at Rockport Mortgage, told CO. “That was a HUD 241(a) loan, which is a supplemental loan to an existing HUD-insured loan. The borrower was able to make energy upgrades and improve energy efficiency by around 50 percent.They saved so much money in operational savings that we took another look at it a couple of years later and saw that this deal worked really well as a FHA 223 refinance.”

The refinancing also allows LIHC to undertake an $8 million renovation campaign of the units, as well as modifications to increase the number of accessible units at the buildings. Occupancy has averaged over 98 percent over the past three years.

Boston-based Rockport is ranked as one of the top FHA multifamily lenders in the U.S. In addition to Parkview Towers, it has also provided FHA 223 (f) financing for several other LIHC-owned properties, including a $74 million loan for Little Italy Restoration Apartments in New York; $42.5 million FHA 223(f) loan for Malcolm Towers in Fort Lee, N.J; and a $27 million loan for Mansion Apartments in Pine Hill, N.J.

“We’ve been busier than ever,” Dromey said. “In March, when [COVID-19] started, we saw things just skyrocketing. COVID is a terrible situation, and affordable housing preservation is more important than ever now.”","LIHC Investment Group has closed a $140 million loan for Parkview Towers, a 688-unit affordable housing property located in West New York, N.J., Commercial Observer has learned.

A local Chinese cultural organization is squaring off against an affordable-housing developer over a long-planned apartment tower for seniors on city land in Chinatown. Read more

A local Chinese cultural organization is squaring off against an affordable-housing developer over a long-planned apartment tower for seniors on city land in Chinatown.

The project called Halewai‘olu Senior Residences would serve 155 kupuna households with low incomes and has been planned for six years following a 2014 city request for proposals.

But a clash has recently arisen over fears the 17-story tower — slated for River Street between Kukui Street and Vineyard Boulevard — will channel emissions from a neighboring mortuary’s crematorium to the headquarters of Lum Sai Ho Tong Hawaii, a cultural society that has maintained the Tin Hau Temple next door for 131 years.

Lum Sai Ho Tong previously supported Halewai‘olu after a minimum 40-foot distance between the tower and its property was encouraged by the Honolulu City Council in 2016.

However, Halewai‘olu’s developer, The Michaels Organization, said detailed engineering and architectural work since then resulted in a need to reduce the tower setback to 23 feet from 40.

Howard Lum, vice president of Lum Sai Ho Tong, said the 40-foot setback addressed the concerns of the society, which initially pushed for a 60-foot setback. He said the more narrow setback will allow “effluent” from two incinerators for human remains at Borthwick Mortuary to bounce off the closer makai end of the building toward the society’s property.

“That’s not right,” he said. “Basically, they’re trying to ram it through.”

In an effort to have changes made to the plan, Lum Sai Ho Tong is lobbying City Council members to impose the wider setback.

“As the project’s adjacent neighbor, we support the Halewai‘olu project,” Lum said in a recent letter to Council members. “However, we are strongly opposed to its changed design and the manner in which it has come about.”

The City Council will soon consider whether to approve the project as part of a process that includes public hearings.

Karen Seddon, regional vice president of New Jersey-based Michaels, said the company earnestly tried to set the tower back 40 feet from the society’s property line but couldn’t achieve that without rendering the $93.6 million project financially unfeasible.

City zoning rules for the site don’t require any setback for what is considered the side of the property, and Seddon said that even with a 23-foot setback, the tower would be 73 feet from the Lum Sai Ho Tong building.

“They don’t want this project,” she said. “We’ve done everything we can do at this point.”

Lum Sai Ho Tong officials said they support affordable senior housing that doesn’t degrade the use of their property.

Eddie Flores Jr., a Lum Sai Ho Tong board director and owner of the L&L Drive-Inn chain, who grew up in the nearby Kukui Gardens affordable-housing project, said senior housing on the city site would help people and improve a section of Chinatown that some view as rather seedy.

“The affordable housing — we are for it — it’s good for the community,” he said. “But (Michaels) just changed their plan without telling us.”

In an environmental report published in August, Michaels contends that its final tower plan won’t exacerbate emissions from the neighboring crematorium and that an odor study conducted in November by Trinity Consultants for Michaels assessed potential emissions impacts on six nearby sites: Lum Sai Ho Tong, Mun Lun School, Chinese Cultural Plaza, Izumo Taishakyo Mission, Kuan Yin Temple and Foster Botanical Garden.

The study concluded that potential odors would be reduced at four sites and not affected at the other two.

“The project is expected to have an overall long-term net benefit to odor nuisance in the area,” the report said.

Borthwick operates its crematorium under a permit from the Clean Air Branch of the state Department of Health.

Jay Morford, president of Borthwick parent Hawaiian Memorial Life Plan Ltd., said the crematorium operates in compliance with regulations.

“There are no harmful emissions that come out,” he said. “They are clean emissions.”

Lum Sai Ho Tong calls the developer’s study deeply flawed and doesn’t accept the clean-emissions claim.

“You ever smell human remains burning?” Lum asked. “It’s a very weird smell. It can be quite obnoxious.”

Clarence Lau, a feng shui master, said it’s not only smoke that is disturbing. He said a chi, or energy, will be directed from the crematorium’s two 29-foot smokestacks to the three-story Lum Sai Ho Tong property where people meet and pray.

The society, in an Oct. 7 letter to the city Department of Land Management, contends the study should have involved a wind tunnel analysis using a scale model and on-site meteorological measurements.

“(The tower) will likely impede the flow of the crematorium emissions, thereby exposing the project’s occupants and neighbors, including (Lum Sai Ho Tong), and the general public of Chinatown, to harmful air quality,” the letter said.

The odor study, according to Michaels, used a mathematical emission dispersion model that is superior to a wind tunnel analysis and is from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, while general wind conditions were based on meteorological data from 1986 to 2016 measured at Honolulu International Airport.

Seddon said it’s difficult to dispel the notion that emissions from a crematorium operated properly make air quality bad.

“There’s a perceived problem that doesn’t exist,” she said.

Even so, Michaels decided to equip every Halewai‘olu unit with air conditioning as one of the design changes to address the perception of harmful or unpleasant air from Borthwick. Tenants in the building will be able to open windows if they want.

If Michaels succeeds, it will fulfill a more than decade-old city vision to shelter a needy population on the site acquired by the city in 1992.

In 2009 then-Mayor Mufi Hannemann attempted to redevelop the site as 100-unit rental housing project aimed at the area’s chronically homeless population. Strong community opposition, however, upended that plan.

Under Mayor Kirk Caldwell, the city offered a 65-year lease to a developer to produce housing for low-income seniors. Michaels was selected over one other bidder.

Since an initial conceptual plan was presented, Michaels added five units to the tower, reduced the makai setback, created airways in the parking podium and reduced parking at the city’s request.

Monthly rents for units with one or two bedrooms including utilities are projected to range from $708 to $2,268. Units would be reserved for people age 62 and older mainly with incomes up to 60% of the median for Honolulu, which equates to $52,920 for a single person or $60,480 for a couple.

Eight units would be reserved for households earning no more than 30% of the median, and 16 units would be for tenants earning up to 80% of the median.

A 10,400-square-foot community center on the first floor is also part of the plan and would be open to the public.

Last year Michaels obtained approval to receive about $90 million in tax-exempt bonds, a loan and tax credits through a state agency. Michaels also is seeking $1.4 million in city fee waivers.

If Michaels is allowed to proceed, construction could begin as early as May and be finished in early 2023.","A local Chinese cultural organization is squaring off against an affordable-housing developer over a long-planned apartment tower for seniors on city land in Chinatown.

320,https://technext.ng/2020/10/20/powerstove-provides-cleaner-and-safer-cookers-but-it-might-not-be-very-affordable/,"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Technext,Powerstove Provides Cleaner and Safer Cookers but it Might not be Affordable,"Powerstove Energy is a startup that was founded by Okey Esse. The company uses tech to create an efficient powerstove that doubles as an energy source for other household appliances. It was launched in 2016.

Overview

Cooking accounts for about 91% of domestic energy consumption in Nigeria. Inefficient stoves fueled with kerosene, biomass and coal have been estimated to cause about 4 million deaths yearly with women and children making up a sizeable portion of the victims.

Indoor pollution, as well as pollution from cooking with wood, have been linked to childhood pneumonia, chronic respiratory diseases, burns and cancers. This creates the need for stoves that can supply clean energy and are affordable.

Powerstove Energy’s solution provides a stove that solves that problem with a techy twist. It implements an IoT System that controls the fan as well as the electricity supply.

What Powerstove offers

Powerstove converts non-recyclable paper as well as wood and agricultural by-products of different crops into biomass pellets. The startup manufactures the stove as well as the pellets for biomass fuel available to users.

The lifespan of a powerstove is a minimum of 5 years and in the course of that time, it can charge electrical appliances as well as be used for cooking. It can be used to charge mobile phones, rechargeable lanterns, power LED bulbs and power banks.

The startup’s latest product is a powerstove with a high power output of 18,000mAh which can charge a television set as well as fans. This stove has an inbuilt inverter. The 18,000mAh powerstove can charge a TV set for about 8 hours, according to Okey.

The stoves are built with an IoT System which has internal pre-programmed and programmable computer chips that control the fan, electricity supply, and data transfers over 2G/3G network. The IoT system uses input sensors and output components to control all the functions.

Pricing

The range of the startup’s powerstoves is from N35,000 to N52,000 with different price points in between. The fuel, which is the biomass pellet, costs N60 per Kilo. One kilo of the pellet can cook for an hour and thirty minutes which also means that it can cook dericas (a derica is a tin can used to measure foodstuffs in Lagos) of beans completely.

These resources are available at Powerstove sales outlets in central markets and mobile kiosks, online and through partnering distributors.

At N600 for 10kg, the biomass fuel (made from wood pellets) is affordable than kerosene is. The cost of a powerstove is relatively higher than that of kerosene stoves and small gas cylinders.

On Konga, the average cost of kerosene stoves is N8,000 while gas cylinders can cost more than N12,000 depending on the size.

A 6kg gas cylinder filled with about N2,000 from Fastgas may be used for about 7 weeks, depending on what you cook with it. The same amount may be used to buy 30kg of powerstove pellets which can be used for about 7 and a half weeks based on the instance of the family of four mentioned earlier.

Alternatives to powerstove

Alternatives to the powerstove include regular cooking stoves that are fueled with kerosene as well as the gas cookers. The cost of using gas and kerosene stoves is heavily affected by the fluctuating price of petroleum products in the country.

At N60 per kilo, the biomass fuel (made from wood pellets) is affordable than kerosene is. The cost of a powerstove is relatively higher than that of kerosene stoves and small gas cylinders. On Konga, the average cost of kerosene stoves is N8,000 while gas cylinders can cost more than N12,000 depending on the size.

A 6kg gas cylinder filled with about N2,000 from Fastgas may be used for about 7 weeks, depending on what you cook with it. The same amount may be used to buy 33 powerstove pellets which can be used for about 3 weeks if you cook a lot based on the average cooking time of 1 hour 30 minutes for each kilo of biomass pellet.

Depending on your need, opting for a gas cooker might help you conserve more money, however, considering the electrical capabilities built into the powerstoves, it may be a more productive alternative.

Funding

The startup raised $5,000 from the Tony Elumelu Foundation and raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Greentec Capital in September. The next step for the company is to increase its production capacity to 25,000 units of powerstoves monthly.

Powerstove Energy currently operates in Abuja, Niger, Nasarawa and Kaduna and will be expanding to Lagos and Kano states soon. Nationwide delivery is available from any of its distributors as well as from its website.

In summary

The multiple functions of the stoves, as well as the IoT-enhancements that help it to regulate its features, make powerstoves a viable alternative in Nigerian homes.

The suburbs moved into the spotlight this spring when the coronavirus pandemic untethered office workers from big city jobs — but bucolic living doesn’t have the same appeal for everyone.

A new study shows which affordable U.S. suburbs offer the highest-quality urban amenities including restaurants, nightlife and the arts. Two New England towns, Waterbury, Conn. and Lowell, Mass. topped the list, according to the analysis by Zillow and Yelp, based on affordability and availability of housing, diversity of business types and level of consumer activity.

“These towns have a lot of options for would-be homeowners who want big city vibes with nightlife and culture, but maybe here they can get a house that meets their wishlist for less money,” said Amanda Pendleton, Zillow home trends expert.

Waterbury topped the list for its vibrant student life and bustling downtown area, which includes the historic Palace Theater and the Mattatuck Museum of art. Waterbury homes are unusually affordable, selling for a median $139,304 — which is 30% less expensive than homes in nearby New Haven.

Outside Boston, a small city called Lowell offers a downtown area, Lowell National Historical Park and beautiful sights along the Merrimack River — at about half the price ($323,576 median) of its notable neighbor. Edison, N.J., Frederick, Va., and Annapolis, Md. also ranked as top suburbs, solidifying the Northeast’s surprising hold on the list, despite the region’s reputation for high living costs.

“I think a lot of people will look at this list and say they never would have considered some of these places. But that’s the idea — these suburbs are under the radar,” said Pendleton. “These places are kind of like hidden gems within these metro areas in terms of affordability.”

In the Midwest, Joliet, home of the Chicagoland Speedway racetrack in Illinois, came in as the third most city-like low-cost suburb, charging a median $155,018 per home, a 40% discount compared to the median price in Chicago. Norman, Okla., also joined the list, bolstered by its student life, nightlife, coffee shops, and cheap home prices (median $180,833).

Zillow and Yelp also highlighted the home of the California Poppy Festival — Lancaster, Calif. — and outdoorsy Tempe, Ariz.

“Tempe, Arizona looks particularly good to me right now. The proximity to the hiking and parks and lakes — it’s a really neat spot and it's on the rise in terms of growth and development,” said Pendleton.

Many Southern towns also offered an attractive quality-of-life while maintaining affordable housing costs — including Sunrise, Fla., near the Everglades, Pasadena, a city near Houston, Tex., Hampton, Va., in the Chesapeake Bay and Marietta, Ga., outside Atlanta.

“All of these places are more affordable or on par with major metros nearby. They’re all sort of geographically central with access to amenities but also, often, access to outdoorsy activities,” said Pendleton.

Young homebuyers want and ‘urban life’ and ‘great backyard’

First-time homebuyers — mostly millennials (ages 24-39) — are driving the homebuying market as the largest generation in U.S. history enters prime homebuying age. These buyers value affordability — 36% are looking for homes under $200,000 and an additional 28% are looking for homes under $350,000, according to a Realtor.com survey this summer. But young buyers are also still looking for nightlife, coffee shops, retail and other urban amenities, according to Pendleton.

“Everybody really likes having these amenities nearby, but when you’re in that 20’s and 30’s stage of life, you can take advantage of it a lot more often. You can want to have those great parts of urban life, but you also might want a great backyard,” she said.

Demand for suburban homes has driven home prices up 3.2% since March compared to only 2.3% in urban areas, and suburban homes are selling 16.2% faster than last year, compared to only a 10.4% acceleration in urban areas, according to a study by Realtor.com.

“The pandemic shaped where people want to live. People are spending so much time in their homes that they’re beginning to ask themselves if their home is meeting their needs. They want more elbow room, more outdoor space — and they can do that by looking further afield, now that they don’t have to commute five days a week,” said Pendleton.

322,https://www.bellevuereporter.com/news/bellevue-council-votes-to-increase-sales-tax-to-support-affordable-housing/,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Bellevue Reporter,Bellevue council votes to increase sales tax to support affordable housing,"The vote from Bellevue and other cities takes revenue away from a county-wide sales tax meant to address chronic homelessness

Bellevue City Council has voted to increase sales tax by one-tenth of 1%, the revenues intended for affordable housing projects and services.

The sales tax increase is a result of House Bill 1590, which allowed counties to impose a one-tenth of 1 cent sales tax with at least 60% of revenues needing to go toward affordable housing or homelessness-related services.

Because King County Council did not vote for the sales tax increase by Sept. 30, a state-set deadline, the county lost exclusive rights to the tax increase and cities were able to use a council vote to collect the increase in sales tax for themselves. As a result, multiple cities fast-tracked votes to increase their sales tax and keep control of the revenues, before King County could vote to collect the revenues for itself.

Of the cities to enact their own sales tax increase, and therefore control 100% of the revenues for affordable housing generated within city limits, Bellevue has the largest tax revenue share so far with an estimated $8.9 million a year. Other cities include Renton, Issaquah, Kent, Covington and Snoqualmie.

Like other cities, Bellevue officials argued the vote gives the city more control on how the tax revenue is spent.

King County Executive Dow Constantine’s proposed budget includes the regional sales tax increase as a funding source to purchase housing for the chronically homeless throughout the county. Now the county will have less money for that plan at the discretion of Bellevue and other cities who are controlling their shares of the tax.

Bellevue has shared it’s affordable housing plans involve providing for a range of income housing like families, seniors on fixed incomes, and first time home buyers. The city is one of the least affordable in the Seattle area.

The new tax takes effect at the beginning of 2021.

Randy Shaw talked about the challenges still facing the Residential Infill Project during Portland Housing Month.

Nationally recognized affordable housing advocate Randy Shaw believes Portland is the test case for whether eliminating single-family zoning will actually produce much new housing.

""The Residential Infill Project is the most sweeping housing reform in the country,"" Shaw said of the zoning change approved by the City Council in August that allows up to six units on practically any residential lot in Portland. ""Will anyone build those units?""

Shaw — the author of the 2018 book ""Generation Priced Out: Who Will Live in the New Urban America?"" — spoke on Wednesday, Oct. 7, as part of Portland Housing Month, a monthlong celebration of housing presented by the Homebuilders Association of Metro Portland. He noted that the Minneapolis City Council voted to allow triplexes on most city lot in October 2019. But, according to Shaw, very few new triplexes have been built there.

That gives Portland the chance to show the rest of the country how to build the additional homes he believes will reduce housing costs. RIP allows up to four units on most lots outright, and up to six if some of them are affordable for households earning less than the area median family income.

""Portland is going to be a good model for what can be built,"" said Shaw, an attorney, author and activist who lives in Berkeley, California. He is also the executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, a nonprofit affordable housing provider in San Francisco, the co-founder of the Uptown Tenderloin Inc. nonprofit organization that spearheaded the creation of the national Uptown Tenderloin Historic District and the editor of BeyondChron, a blog about development issues in the San Francisco area.

A 2018 ECONorthwest study commissioned by the Up for Growth advocacy organization found that Oregon produced only 0.89 new housing units for every new household between 2000 and 2016, creating a supply shortage that is helping to drive up home costs. Without additional construction, the problem will get worse in Portland, which is projected to grow by more than 100,000 households by 2035.

But to build enough new homes fast enough to meet demand, Shaw said other reforms are necessary. They include streamlining the city permitting process, restricting neighborhood challenges to projects that meet zoning and code requirements and preventing appointed commissioners from requiring developers to redesign projects that already meet the same standards.

""What builders are facing to build housing can [be] frustrated. It can be a thankless task,"" said Shaw, explaining that he believes as much housing of all kinds must be built as fast as possible to solve the affordable housing crisis.

Shaw's book challenges the cities to reverse the trend with new policies, including allowing the construction of multifamily housing in single-family neighborhoods. That concept was embraced by the 2018 Oregon Legislature and amplified by RIP. It was supported by many affordable housing advocates, environmentalists and community-based organizations. RIP was opposed by some neighborhood activists and preservations, however, who argued it will encourage the demolition of older homes without guaranteeing that many Portlanders will be able to afford the new housing.

Shaw said he understands the resistance to change, but argues older homes already were being demolished and replaced with larger single-family homes. He says each new unit will be less expensive than any older home they replace.

Shaw's presentation was co-sponsored by the Pamplin Media Group and 1000 Friends of Oregon. Portland Housing Month is a month-long series of events in October sponsored by the Homebuilders Association of Metro Portland. It features socially distanced in-person and online events that are free and open to the public. They are intended to support homebuilders and connect them to consumers. The events include Home Tours, a Home & Garden Show in Your Neighborhood and online expert presentations, such as Shaw's presentation.

Portland Housing Month was created for the first time after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the association to cancel its three annual signature events, the Tour of Remodeled Homes, the Street of Dreams and the Home & Garden Show at the Portland Expo Center.

There are some visible differences between the original configuration and the latest Jetson Nano kit. Apart from memory, the number of USB ports, power connector and the camera interfaces differ from the Jetson Nano 4GB kit available in the market.

According to NVIDIA, the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit is the ideal platform for teaching, learning, and developing AI and robotics applications. It uses the same proven NVIDIA JetPack Software Development Kit (SDK) used in breakthrough AI-based products. The new developer kit is unique in its ability to utilize the entire NVIDIA CUDA-XTM accelerated computing software stack including TensorRT for fast and efficient AI inference — all in a small form factor and at a significantly lower price.

The below table summarises the similarities and differences between the two configurations.





The Jetson family of products runs on a software stack called JetPack which includes Linux for Tegra (L4T), a purpose-built, Debian-based Linux distribution. NVIDIA offers an optimized version of JetPack for Nano, Xavier, and other platforms.

The JetPack SDK used by all Jetson developer kits provides a PC-like Ubuntu-based desktop development experience. JetPack SDK comes pre-loaded with all the necessary libraries one would require to build AI applications.

For Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit, NVIDIA has built an optimized JetPack distribution which has a smaller footprint.

The 2GB configuration of Jetson Nano supports popular deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet. Developers can download fully configured container images from NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC).

The Jetson platform uses the same familiar CUDA-X interface for model training and inference. With support for runtimes based on TensorRT and cuDNN, AI practitioners can use the same workflow and code to deploy AI models both in the cloud and at the edge.

The Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit includes the same 40-pin breakout header as the 4GB version that is compatible with many peripherals. The Jetson partner ecosystem has designed and built peripherals that work seamlessly with the kits. Since the kits support standard camera serial interface (CSI), most of the cameras designed for Raspberry Pi work with no additional configuration.

There are multiple robotic kits based on the Jetson Nano are available in the market.

Compared to Raspberry Pi 4 and other development kits available at similar price points, the Jetson Nano 2GB not only supports all the popular AI frameworks and networks but also delivers orders of magnitude higher AI performance.

The chart below shows the AI inferencing performance of Jetson Nano 2GB on popular DNN models for image classification, object detection, pose estimation, segmentation, and others. The benchmark was run with FP16 precision using JetPack 4.4.

NVIDIA has also published the comparison of the inference performance between Jetson Nano 2GB, Raspberry Pi 4 and Google Coral Edge TPU.

Apart from inference, the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit can also be used for on-device training of neural networks based on the transfer learning technique.

NVIDIA has also announced the Jetson AI Certification program for makers and instructors. Participants are expected to complete the self-paced courses offered by NVIDIA and submitting a project for evaluation.

Martin Court is a former motel which was transformed into a supportive housing complex two decades ago. New funding from King County’s Health through Housing ordinance could expand this type of program across the county. Aaron Kunkler/staff photo

On a chilly Monday afternoon, case manager Richard Gibson walked through the courtyard at Martin Court in the southwest corner of Seattle’s Georgetown neighborhood.

The weather in the days before had taken a cold turn, and the colorful children’s playground he strode past sat vacant. Lining either side of the courtyard and parking lot were rows of doors, each one housing an individual or family experiencing homelessness.

And each one represents security, and a place to get out of the weather, for the people who live there.

“That’s just extremely important,” Gibson said.

Martin Court is one of several similar properties run by the Low Income Housing Institute, which provides housing for people in King County. It’s a former motel that was retrofitted two decades ago into temporary supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness.

Residents can stay at Martin Court for up to two years as they get their bearings. Gibson and his colleague Charmaine Day help the residents get services like mental health counseling, finding permanent housing and even healthy cooking classes. Administrators say the program is largely successful, with most people moving into permanent housing after their stay at Martin Court.

And it’s programs like this that could be expanded under the recently approved King County Health through Housing ordinance. The ordinance was approved by the Metropolitan King County Council on Oct. 13.

It created a 0.1% sales tax, which the county is planning on bonding against, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for affordable housing projects.

This funding can be used to buy existing hotels, motels and nursing homes, then turn them into emergency and affordable housing units with services for mental and behavioral health. The original proposal would have raised nearly $68 million a year, allowing the county to raise $400 million in bonds. But seven cities enacted their own version of the tax, reducing the amount the county will collect by some $17 million a year.

King County Department of Community and Human Services Director Leo Flor said they’re still calculating how much they will be able to bond for.

But as hotels, motels and nursing homes likely go up for sale in significant numbers due to the economic fallout and reduced travelers from the coronavirus pandemic, Flor said the county is hoping to buy them.

“We expect, and are seeing, signs of opportunities in that market,” Flor said.

The ordinance could create housing for up to 2,000 people by 2022. According to the 2020 Point-In-Time Count, there were some 11,751 people experiencing homelessness across the county last winter.

Flor said the county is experiencing three crises that feed into the current homelessness crisis. The first is the coronavirus pandemic, which is making congregate shelter dangerous. The second is the economic crisis that has been creating homelessness for years as housing becomes too expensive for many to afford. The third is the crisis around systemic racism, which causes disproportionate homelessness in some communities.

Black, indigenous and other communities of color are disproportionately affected by homelessness, according to the Point-In-Time Count.

In addition to addressing homelessness immediately, there’s evidence that stable, single-room housing — like those provided by converted hotels — is keeping people safer during the pandemic.

A recently-released study from the University of Washington found that this kind of shelter kept people from contracting the coronavirus. The study suggested it was lessening the number of outbreaks.

“That was kind of a ‘mission accomplished’ for the first goal,” said Gregg Colburn, an Associate Professor at the University of Washington’s College of Built Environments.

Stable housing gives people a sense of stability, safety and security — a place to regroup and begin to think about their futures again without the mental stress of surviving on the streets.

Those benefits are something that Lynn DeMarco, the area manager in charge of Martin Court, sees. The goal of the two-year program at the former hotel is to get people into permanent housing, and give them the skills they need to be successful and keep housing.

“Our job is to make sure that, first off, to get them out of crisis. To get them healthy, physically, mentally,” DeMarco said.

Even offering housing at motels on a temporary basis has proven effective in the Snoqualmie Valley. The Snoqualmie Valley Shelter Services has been running a motel voucher program for its most medically vulnerable residents.

The next step is finding permanent housing, which the county is in short supply of. King County set a goal last year to build or preserve 44,000 affordable housing units within five years. It’s a step toward the roughly 156,000 affordable units the county needs today, and the additional 88,000 units it will need by 2040.

That step is where Martin Court resident Alvin Sweet is now. Sweet moved to Martin Court a year and a half ago with his girlfriend. Before, they were living at a tiny home camp in South Lake Union.

They’re hoping to find permanent housing next, but he said he’s found a community at Martin Court.

“This is a great place, it’s been good for us,” Sweet said.

328,https://greatist.com/live/design-tips-small-spaces,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Greatist,"Easy, Affordable Design Hacks for Small Living Spaces","Share on Pinterest Jelena Jojic Tomic/Stocksy For many of us, our whole lives have been happening in the same one or two rooms since the pandemic forced us indoors. We’re working in the same space that we’re supposed to relax in, and leaving the house a lot less than we’re used to. And now that cold weather’s around the corner we’re bracing for even more time seeing these four walls. It’s not the most uplifting prospect, especially if you live with a mental health condition. Which got us thinking. How can we optimize our living spaces — in an achievable and affordable way — to help us feel less dread about inhabiting our claustrophobic abodes? To find inspiration, we looked to our friends on the internet. Here are eight creative space changes folks have made that improved their mental health.

1. Get a desk you can stow away at the end of the day Who: Lauren, 1 bedroom apartment The hack: A brass and acrylic folding table to use as a work desk, facing toward the window



Cost: $125 How long it took: 15 minutes to set up, 5 minutes each day to put away What they were feeling before they made the changes: “Before I got the table, I was working on the couch and my productivity was seriously declining about 1 month into quarantine. Some days I hardly got anything done, and couldn’t figure out what was wrong.” Why it helped: “It’s helped so much! It’s made a huge difference in my productivity, and I fold it up at the end of the workday. I feel like it helps me separate work time from lounging on the couch time.”

2. Create a DIY mini yoga studio Who: Lindsey, 1 bedroom apartment What they did: Moved furniture around to create a yoga and meditation space Cost: Free (rearranged items she already had from pre-pandemic) What they were feeling before they made the changes: “ANXIETY. I was anxious that I no longer had access to a yoga studio to keep up my practice. I needed to create my own Zen space to continue my practice and relieve stress.” Why it helped: “I now have my very own Zen space to practice, meditate, stretch, and focus on my mental health!”

3. Treat yourself to quality bedding Who: Charlie, 1 bedroom apartment What they did: Invested in quality cooling bedding to combat sleep troubles Cost: Sheets, $33.99, Duvet cover, $230 What they were feeling before they made the changes: “Chaos. Life is chaotic and work is chaotic, so I wanted my bedroom to be a space with very little extra things, and it needed to be peaceful so I could sleep well.” Why it helped: “My bedroom is now a place where I can go calm down and shut off. It’s always nice and dark in there because I have blackout curtains. I run warm, so the cooling sheets and duvet cover help me sleep better. No matter what I’m going through, I walk in there and I’m passed out in 5 minutes.”

4. Deck your apartment out in plants Who: Claire, studio apartment What they did: Bought a bunch of plants Cost: $8 to $20 per plant What they were feeling before they made the changes: “Before we had the plants the apartment didn’t feel as calming and relaxing. It felt like home, but there was something sort of stale and rigid about it.” Why it helped: “After we got the plants, the whole room just felt so much more alive and I’ve felt a lot more calm and relaxed with their presence. They make the space feel less depressing. I didn’t think having plants would positively impact my mood, but it definitely has!”

5. Start fresh with a new crisp paint job Who: Justin, 1 bedroom apartment What they did: Painted the walls in the apartment a crisp white Cost/how long it took: $100 for the paint, 2 to -3 days for painting and drying What they were feeling before they made the changes: “I had a color palette from a few years back of earthy tones. The intention was to make it feel warm and intimate. A few months into quarantine, it started to feel more like being buried underground.” Why it helped: “I started with my dining area and saw how much brighter and more joyful the space seemed, so I just kept going. Subconsciously, I think I’m wanting a clean canvas to start anew on the other side of this — whatever that may be.”

6. Use a diffuser to set the mood Who: Ashley, 1 bedroom apartment What they did: Purchased a diffuser and essential oils Cost: $40 What they were feeling before they made the changes: “Living isolated, I was feeling a bit bored and lonely and wanted my room to be more inviting and enjoyable.” Why it helped: “I love blending different oils for energy, relaxation or rejuvenation. My energy is lifted with beautiful scents. It helps to change the energy when going from work mode to switching off!”

7. Create a standing workspace Who: Jamie, 1 bedroom apartment What they did: Created a standing desk setup by purchasing an adjustable standing desk and a standing mat that promotes movement. Cost: $578 for the desk and $149 for the mat What they were feeling before they made the changes: “I was feeling anxious about not moving much through the day. I was finding that I’d just get up and wander around my apartment, maybe do dishes or throw laundry in, just to get up out of my chair.”



Why it helped: “I dance around a little or do squats during meetings when I am not on video. Really anything to let some energy out. It helps me to stay focused at work. I am just more comfortable and physically feel better and that has some impact on my anxiety.”","How can we optimize our living spaces — in an achievable and affordable way — to help us feel less dread about inhabiting our claustrophobic abodes?

The planet has felt borderline apocalyptic recently, right? I mean, here in Aus we started the year with fire, moved onto flood, watched habitats disappear and a virus take over. Greta Thunberg is crying, koalas are dying, and we’re stuck at home using waaaay too much (not super sustainable) laundry detergent in an effort to both literally and metaphorically clean up our lives – can we please just do something about climate change already?

In good news, there are people, nations and companies out there doing their climate bit. Like, by 2021 Costa Rica’s electricity production is going to be 100 per cent renewable. Go you, Costa Rica! Jacinda Adern (all hail the queen) got her Zero Carbon Bill passed. And then there are companies like Unilever which is helping make homecare products more sustainable through its Clean Future Strategy.

But while we love a good AUD1.6 billion investment from the big guys, it’s slightly less feasible for us mere mortals to take climate action. Or is it? We came up with a few ways you can take eco-action without putting your fragile bank account in jeopardy:

Change to a green energy provider

This is a no-cost move you can make and it’s a winner for the environment. There are a heap of better alternatives to the big, pro-fossil fuel energy companies out there. You can just consult this handy dandy green guide and find a provider that suits you and your enviro-friendly ethics.

Buy good homecare brands

Brands that are good for the planet, good for your washing and good for your wallet. Omo (or Persil if you’re a Kiwi) just released a more sustainable reformulation featuring a bunch of additional naturally-derived ingredients. This means the products have less reliance on fossil fuels for cleaning (which are used to develop heaps of cleaning products, who knew?).

It’s a big step in cleaning up the homecare sector – replacing outdated chemistry with game-changing thinking that puts renewable sources of carbon at its core. Even better, their bottles are made with recycled plastic and are 100% recyclable.

Bit wary of green products that are better for the planet but cost a fortune and/or ruin your gear? Fear not – this Omo range is guaranteed to dominate those tough post-work drinks burger stains without costing more than your average Joe cleaning products.

Plant all the natives

Up for a bit of gardening now that the weather is warmer? Looking to grow your green thumb? If your green spaces need a bit of a facelift, think about planting natives. These guys require less water, fertilisers or pesticides plus they’re already specifically designed for our climate.

Hit the op shop

When it comes to sustainable living, second-hand clothing can’t be beaten. Avoid the consumerist, capitalist mentality and start shopping at thrift stores, garage sales and flea markets. Hell, you don’t even have to leave the house now that Depop is here.

Buy your home-care in bulk

We get it, sustainable home-care can be super expensive. A million bucks for laundry detergent? No thanks. Half a home loan for natural dish soap? Get out of town. But in good news, bigger really is better when it comes to sustainability – so take climate action and buy in bulk. Omo’s range of liquids come in sizes up to 6L, hint hint.

Get on your bike

Looking to limit your carbon footprint? Start by taking fewer car trips. If you can, swap the four wheels for two wheels and start cycling across town. It’s good exercise and better for the air to breathe. Win/win.

Start a compost pile

Or better yet, build your own veggie garden. Live in the city? No worries. Grab a few pallets and a couple of hanging herb gardens and you’ve got yourself a grow-your-own-oasis. Nothing says ‘minimal food miles’ than a veggie garden out the back. The planet will thank you for it.","And then there are companies like Unilever which is helping make homecare products more sustainable through its Clean Future Strategy.

331,https://channellife.com.au/story/hands-on-review-blueant-x3-speaker-local-affordable-and-good-quality,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ChannelLife Australia,"Hands-on review: BlueAnt X3 speaker: Local, affordable and good quality!?","The portable, cylindrical speaker market has been blowing up over the past few years, and with summer and all its outdoor glory fast approaching, Aussie-owned audio vendor BlueAnt has updated its offering with the new X3 Bluetooth Portable speaker, retailing at $239.95.

Bigger and bolder than the cute little X1 and the slimline X2, the X3 is launching only in black and is designed to sit horizontally with two feet to hold it steady, with each end functioning as a little subwoofer, the X logo placards pumping in time with whatever funky bassline you choose.

Weighing in at 1.12kg, according to my kitchen scales, it might be little much for a long hike but will fit comfortably among beach gear, picnic paraphernalia or casual camping equipment.

When you press the silicon power button you are greeted with what might be one of my favourite startup sounds since Brian Eno’s Windows 95 tune – a didgeridoo-esque whoompa that reminds you that you are supporting an Aussie business.

On that subject, if there was ever a time to support local, then this is it. BlueAnt's range of audio devices offers great alternatives to buying from a global behemoth like Logitech-owned Ultimate Ears (UE Boom).

I have no doubt the service and support would be infinitely better, and not just because you can’t get much worse (ask me about my experience with Blue Microphones - also Logitech owned).

In general, I am very impressed by the sound that comes from the BlueAnt X3. For the techies, you can find a full list of specs at the end of this review.

The sound feels rich without any frequency feeling under- or over-powered. It obviously doesn’t reach the heights of a good hi-fi, but for a battery-powered, portable speaker the clarity, cleanness and warmth are surprisingly good.

The bass boost button is a nice addition. There is a decent bass presence without it and when activated, you get a nice bit extra without it overtaking and causing the unit to rattle and splutter.

I ramped the volume right up and, although I felt bad for the neighbours, the sound remained clean.

One downside is that the sound does only come from the front, meaning it doesn’t offer 360° sound –however, I’d say you get a good 200° before you lose any volume or quality.

Aesthetically, it’s nothing revolutionary but personally, I prefer its subtle, sensuous curves over the options of hairspray can or arty vase that have taken over the market. It has a little more sophistication than other, more fluoro options.

It’s solid and feels like it could take a few knocks without crumbling but it isn’t advertised as rugged. The main point of vulnerability would almost definitely be either end with the soft rubber that good bass needs.

On the flip side, it is rated IP67 which means dust should be no problem at all and it can easily take a short and shallow swim.

I gave it a quick dunk in a half-full sink which muffled the sound even after I took it out. It was alright soon enough, though it definitely retained a bit of water for a few minutes, especially behind the endcaps. You’d also have to be careful to wait until it is totally dry before opening the connector compartment, just in case.

The Bluetooth connectivity is brilliant and there is 3.5mm aux input for the cable-inclined.

It uses USB C to charge and the 9600 mAh battery offers 15 hours expected playtime at half volume with bass boost off.

The battery indicator on top is a nice little addition as is the USB port that allows the unit to function as a powerbank in times of need.

Double press the play button to get Siri or Google Assistant to jump to your command and you can even take a call through the built-in microphone.

I tested all of these features and not a single one let me down – I could even hold a call without having to repeat myself ten times, give up and switch to my handset.

What I didn’t get to test was the ability to pair a couple of these bad boys for a super-stereo experience, though nothing about the connectivity of the speaker makes me doubt it would work.

There is no connected app – although it integrates well with the voice assistant – so there is no remote wake or any of the other goodies that smart capabilities bring. While this doesn’t bother me in the slightest, it’s a nice-to-have that I know some people do enjoy.

Overall, the BlueAnt X3 Bluetooth speaker just feels really nice. Holding it in your hands, pressing the buttons, even opening the rear access port, you just get a sense that it’s well-built and reliable.

I’ve been keen to get a portable speaker for a while now but nothing I had seen in my price range appealed to me.

The X3 fills that void spectacularly.

Buy if: You want surprisingly good sound in a solidly built, portable, good looking unit all at an affordable price.

Don’t buy if: You want tippy-top of the line sound (and to pay for it) or an integrated app.

A Melbourne-based home builder, Carter Grange creates modern and elegant homes that represent the ultimate in quality, on trend designs and affordability.

“We wanted to establish a company that did things differently internally and externally. We wanted our own look, feel and finish. A big part of that was Hebel being standard, whereas most builders offer it as an upgrade to the home. So Hebel was a big part of us being different,” Forrest said.

Hebel, a high performance autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) available in panels or blocks, has allowed Carter Grange to build without traditional masonry products, which have strong limitations to project efficiency and client satisfaction.

“Historically, brickwork finishes have led to various issues on-site. Client expectations are hard to meet when dealing with bricks and bricklaying quality. Brick colour variation, blending of bricks and the colour of the mortar – there are many factors that often end up in dispute that cost a lot of money and time. As well as a loss of confidence in the builder from the client,” Forrest explained.

“Using Hebel is about a quality finish for us as the builder and for our client. We’re not tied up with clients arguing about these types of quality issues. We are discussing important matters to enhance the job moving forward. The job’s not delayed... we don’t have arguments with clients about Hebel,” he added.

Using Hebel also has practical benefits for Carter Grange, especially when working on knock-down rebuild projects on tight sites across Melbourne. According to Forrest, Hebel not only takes up less space on-site but also generates less mess during and after installation. Hebel also saves builders considerable time on their construction schedules.

“Hebel slashes our build time by up to an average of three weeks compared to brick builds, which means significantly less labour time, less mess on-site and cleaner, safer work areas,” he said.

“Scaffolding requirements take up a lot of space on-site… to add all the bricks required, all the sand as well as areas to mix mortar, it's very difficult. We don’t have that space on our sites,” he added.

Having worked with Hebel for over 25 years, Forrest knows that Hebel prevents a number of issues from happening in the build process.

""We are in the business of building people's dreams and it’s a very emotional process. We have a great construction team that do a fantastic job. I generally only need to get involved when things aren’t going right on-site, which is rare because with Hebel we don’t get things going wrong. It's one less headache we need to deal with,"" he added.

In addition to quicker build time, Hebel ensures a higher quality finish to the project, which is durable and easy to maintain, says Forrest.

""When rendered, Hebel looks like a new home, years down the track. It's easy to maintain and clean. I drive past homes we built many years ago that still look new, that’s a nice feeling,” he concluded.","Carter Grange co-founder Rohan Forrest attributes much of their company’s success to the use of innovative materials such as Hebel in their projects.

Article content A blitz announced in August to find homes for 100 low-income individuals and families by Oct. 1 resulted in only four people moving into rental units as colder weather sweeps into the nation’s capital and more of the homeless fear using emergency shelters during a global pandemic. “This has been tough and we didn’t get the results yet that we want to see,” Alliance to End Homelessness Ottawa executive director Kaite Burkholder Harris said Tuesday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Nothing can be not tested in order to try to have a housing-focused response.” The Alliance to End Homelessness and the City of Ottawa announced on Aug. 10 that they were on the hunt for 100 affordable units with an end-of-September deadline, hoping to provide more homes to low-income people before a second wave of COVID-19. The priority was to house prospective tenants who qualified for rent subsidies and were ready to move.

Article content The Eastern Ontario Landlord Association (EOLO) helped find property owners with vacant units for rent. The blitz largely depended on the availability of units and the willingness of landlords to participate. But according to EOLO executive director John Dickie, the timing of the blitz wasn’t ideal. “The whole notion of trying to do something in housing in two months was a concept that I could have predicted would not have worked well,” Dickie said. Anyone who rents a unit knows there’s a mandatory 60-day notice period to landlords before vacating. Announcing the blitz more than a week into August realistically, but still optimistically, put in play units that would be available in October or November. Another problem has been the types of rental units that have seen increased vacancies during the pandemic. Dickie said those homes have been higher-end units that wouldn’t align with the affordability requirements for low-income tenants. Adding to the complications, landlords want to sign a new tenant quickly when a unit becomes vacant. Waiting for agencies to find tenants and confirm subsidies doesn’t respond to the speed of business, Dickie said. The blitz might not have achieved the difficult goal, but Dickie said the success of finding people homes should still be recognized. “I don’t care if it’s 10 or 35 people. To them, this isn’t a failure,” he said. While only four people received affordable units in the blitz period, Burkholder Harris said there are about 30 more households in the pipeline for rental homes.

Article content On top of that, the blitz has provided an infrastructure that could be used to inform a long-term housing procurement with the private sector, Burkholder Harris said. Burkholder Harris said organizers will consider extending the blitz through October. In launching the blitz in August, Burkholder Harris said the Alliance and the city were taking a reputational risk with setting an ambitious goal. “I absolutely think it’s been tough,” Burkholder Harris said Thursday. “I feel sad because we don’t have enough people housed. We never have enough people housed and that’s the critical part. We’re going to get people housed because the subsidies are still there after the blitz. I think what has been hard and has felt like a hit was that nothing feels urgent enough in how we’re getting people housed and supported during the winter.” The centralized wait list for community housing has had more than 10,000 households. During the pandemic, the city has opened physical-distancing centres and isolation centres to ease the pressure on emergency shelters. The city estimates there are 150 people sleeping outside, up from 90 before the pandemic. Salvation Army outreach services have told the city that between April and June they served 282 unique individuals who were sleeping outside or couch-surfing, a 68 per cent increase from the same three months in 2019. The Salvation Army’s intel from the street indicated there was a hesitancy for people to use emergency shelters, the city learned.

Article content Paul Lavigne, the city’s program manager for homelessness programs and resource services, said 34 landlords have submitted units through a website set up for the blitz, but many of the 58 units identified haven’t been suitable for the program. The pandemic has “intensified the need for safe and affordable housing” and the city continues encouraging landlords to identify available units, Lavigne said. Burkholder Harris said there has been more government money poured into housing programs during the pandemic, but it could be an uphill battle to maintain or grow financial support in 2021, especially from the city, which has contributed $30 million over the past two years for new affordable units. However, council’s leadership has advocated for “self-discipline” in developing the 2021 budget. “This is on us as members of this community to keep pushing for councillors to move toward a really critical response on housing-focused support for people,” Burkholder Harris said.

339,https://eos.org/opinions/affordable-clean-energy-rule-threatens-progress-of-clean-air-act,"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eos,Affordable Clean Energy Rule Threatens Progress of Clean Air Act,"Last year, the U.S. EPA finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, a dramatic relaxing in air pollution standards. ACE effectively rolls back the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP), policy that aimed to reduce carbon emissions from U.S. electrical power generation—in particular, from coal-burning power plants—through the first national standards. ACE instead allows states to decide their own standards and makes major changes to the way the EPA calculates the health risks of air pollution.

As an atmospheric scientist in Maryland focused on air pollution and a policy wonk turned environmental epidemiologist, we argue that ACE does not adequately address the emission reductions needed in the United States and that it is imperative the government address the serious air quality–related repercussions it will have on public health.

Better Than Nothing Is Not Good Enough

Twenty-two states and seven cities are suing the EPA in federal appeals court, asserting that ACE fails to take the necessary steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Clean Air Act was the first comprehensive federal law regulating air pollution emissions. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court found in 2007 that the EPA has statutory authority and is, in fact, required by the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). That’s the precedent under which 22 states and seven cities are suing the EPA in federal appeals court, asserting that ACE fails to take the necessary steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Although ACE is projected to decrease emissions of CO 2 and copollutants compared to no action, ACE and the CPP differ dramatically in the magnitude of reduction they would achieve. According to the EPA, the CPP would have reduced CO 2 emissions by 415 million tons by 2030, whereas the ACE rule is projected to reduce emissions by 11 million tons. That amounts to a 0.7% contribution to overall reduction, with much of the decrease due to ongoing market and industry trends. Compared to the CPP, the ACE rule will allow an increase of CO 2 emissions by 3% and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions by 5%–6% by 2030, although these increases are challenging to estimate because of the range of measures that states might apply.

The weaker emission reductions under ACE are due to the rule’s far less stringent control strategies. All emission policies like ACE and CPP are required under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to establish the “best system of emission reduction” for the pollutant and the source. Under ACE, that system is defined as heat rate improvements (HRI), essentially energy efficiency measures, at coal-fired electricity-generating units. By contrast, the CPP established a set of emission reduction measures, including utilizing lower-emitting natural gas units and transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy, in addition to the energy efficiency measures included in ACE. When establishing ACE, the EPA argued that the CPP exceeded the agency’s authority to define the best system of emission reduction.

This limited approach may also result in increased SO 2 and NO x emissions through a phenomenon known as the rebound effect. If coal power plants become more efficient through HRI investments, dependence on coal-generated power could rise, increasing emissions overall [Keyes et al., 2019].

A Problem Downwind

The state of Maryland filed a 126 Petition to the EPA arguing it could not meet its own state standards for air quality because of coal plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia that were not using pollution control technologies. Coal power generation has been on the decline in the United States, a trend the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated. The coal plants still in operation are running at lower capacity—some at just 30% to 40%. But because those plants are producing less energy and thus fewer emissions overall, they don’t need to use pollution control measures to meet annual caps. Modern technologies can remove 80% to 90% of the NO x and SO 2 under optimized conditions; however, about 30% of the nation’s coal-burning power plants do not have scrubbers, and 22% do not have advanced nitrogen controls.

Maryland is one state that has substantially reduced its production of emissions, as a result of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 and its membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Yet in 2016, the state of Maryland filed a 126 Petition to the EPA arguing it could not meet its own state standards for air quality because of coal plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia that were not using pollution control technologies. ACE’s allowance for states to create their own emission standards may further exacerbate air quality nonattainment concerns in downwind states.

Health Consequences of ACE

The increase in emissions that ACE will allow translates into significant public health impacts. Even the analysis of the rule does not treat these impacts adequately. When ACE was proposed in 2017, an initial analysis of the new rule used the existing CPP and its more stringent standards as a baseline scenario. By the time the rule was finalized in June 2019, new analyses compared ACE to a world that wasn’t implementing the CPP.

Accordingly, the initial analysis showed that ACE would increase premature deaths by 470–1,400 and asthma attacks by 48,000 in the United States by 2030, whereas the final analysis found a modest reduction in premature deaths (50–122) and asthma attacks (14,000). For context, the CPP would have prevented 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks each year, making the final ACE rule pale in comparison. Given the pushback that EPA received about the projected increases in premature deaths cited in the initial analysis, the change in baseline approaches is likely an effort to conceal scientific evidence.

The projected health impacts are based on established environmental epidemiology literature linking fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone exposure to adverse respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes. The EPA did not quantify the health effects associated with changes in emissions of SO 2 , NO x , and mercury, which include asthma cases, emergency room visits, and damage to the developing nervous system [e.g., Kampa and Castanas, 2008]. If these effects were taken into account, the public health toll of the ACE rule would rise even higher.

The EPA recently proposed to maintain the PM2.5 standard, contrary to advice from independent scientists, who were intentionally excluded from the rule-making process. An architect of ACE (and former coal industry lobbyist) has said the “collateral effects” of the rule on copollutant levels can be addressed through established regulations under the Clean Air Act, such as criteria air pollutant reviews. However, the EPA’s own actions demonstrate how adamant the agency is about doing just the opposite. The Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science rule would discount studies that rely on confidential health information. If finalized, the EPA would devalue research that forms the basis for criteria air quality standards unless the personal medical records used in the study were made public.

The EPA has also undermined its own authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by determining that it is neither appropriate nor necessary to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. Further, the EPA recently proposed to maintain the PM 2.5 standard, contrary to advice from independent scientists, who were intentionally excluded from the rule-making process. The timing could not be worse, as early research indicates counties with a 1-unit increase in long-term PM 2.5 exposure suffer 8% higher COVID-19 death rates. (In light of the long history of racial and ethnic injustices in U.S. pollution levels and the fact that Black Americans are dying from COVID-19 at more than twice the rate of white Americans, a new study will assess whether air quality disparities contribute to increased COVID risks among communities of color.)

Scientists and the Public Need to Insist on Science-Based Policy

The ACE rule is part of a larger effort to relax and reinterpret Clean Air Act standards that will hamper the effectiveness of future policies to protect human health. As scientists, we understand the importance of providing accurate and reliable information to inform decisionmaking. However, the purposeful tactics to misguide the public, including changing the way costs and benefits are balanced, removing experts from EPA advisory boards, and ignoring the health benefits of reducing pollution, will have substantial consequences for future EPA operations.

We call on the science community and all U.S. residents to hold the EPA to a better standard. Check the docket regularly to monitor proposed EPA actions and comment whenever possible. Seek opportunities to partner with state policymakers who are pushing back against unfounded EPA rules. Vote for government representatives who care about the health of their constituencies. And insist that the agency with authority to keep our air clean and breathable commit to environmental rule making anchored in the best available science.","Last year, the U.S. EPA finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, a dramatic relaxing in air pollution standards.

In rural India, smallholder farmers often struggle to earn a living. They are also largely dependent on highly polluting diesel fuel, the dominant source of energy across northern and eastern India, responsible for 5 percent of the country’s carbon emissions. Diesel fuel is also costly: Farmers across the country spend $4 billion per year to operate 9 million diesel-powered water pumps for irrigation, presenting a huge financial burden for farmers, most of whom cannot afford to invest in alternatives.

Enter Oorja, an innovative, mission-driven social enterprise based in New Delhi that provides integrated energy solutions to replace diesel engines used along the agricultural value chain. Oorja installs, operates and maintains solar water pumps, which are each shared by 15 to 20 smallholder farmers. The water pumped is metered and sold by volume through a service called Oonnati, achieving 20 percent cost savings compared to diesel-powered irrigation.

Over 180 users have adopted Oorja’s clean energy services and moved away from diesel fuel without any upfront cost for technology acquisition. Benefits extend beyond the cost savings, said Dr. Clementine Chambon, co-founder and chief technology officer for Oorja. Because farmers can irrigate their land throughout the year using Oorja’s system, agricultural productivity has increased by 6 to 15 percent for participating farmers — and income shot up by 30 percent. Further, a clever “cluster"" model for operations, in which each group of farmers is serviced by a multi-skilled field team that is hired locally, generates additional local employment.

Given its sustainability bona fides, it’s no wonder that Oorja has garnered a number of accolades, including the $US100,000 Grand Prize in the 2019 Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge, which aims to recognize new business ideas from early-stage entrepreneurs around the world who are leveraging technology for social impact. Oorja was founded in 2016 after co-founders Chambon and Amit Saraogi met during a climate change workshop for young entrepreneurs, while Chambon was completing a PhD in bioenergy at Imperial College London.

“We see major potential for pay-per-use-based energy solutions such as Oonnati to contribute to diversifying and commercializing agriculture, boosting crop yields, generating employment, and enhancing farmers’ income,” Chambon told TriplePundit. “The potential to scale Oonnati irrigation services in India is vast.”

Oonati's pay-per-use model gives smallholder farmers access to solar-powered water pumps without the upfront costs associated with purchasing new equipment.

Removing upfront costs for smallholder farmers

The benefits of the approach could extend beyond India. Smallholder farmers produce 80 percent of the world’s food but are among the poorest of individuals. Among its community-based solar projects, Oorja has deployed 15 solar irrigation pumps and a mini-grid. Additionally, two solar-powered agro-processing mills allow farmers to mill their grains and other crops at the village level, saving 25 percent compared to diesel-based processing. This Oojjwal milling service was launched as a vertically-integrated offering sold to the same groups of marginal farmers that purchase the Oonati service.

Resolving the initial cost barrier for acquiring solar energy systems is a linchpin in Oorja’s approach, said Preeti Kumari, project officer for the startup. Around 90 percent of farmers in India are not in the position to invest in individual solar pumps. Although the government has offered a capital subsidy on solar pumps since 2014, most farmers cannot afford the high initial deposit of around INR 30,000 (US$500), equivalent to six months of income.

The impressive impact of Oorja’s scalable and sustainable community-based solution is what merited Cisco’s recognition, Mary de Wysocki, senior director of corporate social responsibility at Cisco, told TriplePundit. “Oorja’s solution fulfills both environmental and sustainability aspects in that farmers can rent out these solar systems and create additional livelihoods,” she said.

Young entrepreneurs hold the key to an inclusive future, but they need support to succeed

The measurable impacts of Oorja’s model reflect the mission-driven focus of today’s young entrepreneurs, Chambon added. “The motivation in the current generation of social entrepreneurs is to create value rather than just making a profit,” she told us. “We believe it comes from an awareness of pressing social and environmental issues, empathy, motivation to do something meaningful, and perhaps a heightened sense of accountability for the outcomes created by businesses.”

Chambon and her colleagues at Oorja are not alone in sharing this approach to business. According to a multi-country study published in 2018, almost a third of new startups aim to solve a social problem alongside turning a profit, a trend driven largely by young entrepreneurs.

Further, nearly half of all U.S. workers are employed by small businesses, meaning the empowerment of entrepreneurs is a key strategy to ensure future job creation. In other words: Supporting young entrepreneurs can not only create jobs and ensure future economic prosperity, but it also opens the door for innovative solutions to key social challenges that have held global economies and societies back for generations.

“These young people are really visionary founders,” de Wysocki said. “They’ve got great ideas, but often they can’t get that initial money even to develop a prototype or proof of concept.” Young social entrepreneurs often need consulting support and expert advice on their business models in order to translate their big ideas to pilot trials, and eventually to their first customers, she continued. “With that mindset, the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is about moving these visionaries through the cycle of innovation.”

Partner support fuels scale and greater impact

Partners like Cisco have boosted Oorja’s efforts to grow from the pilot stage to scaling its services across the agricultural value chain and in new markets within India, Kumari said. The Cisco prize money “helped us to expand Oonnati in the northeastern state of Assam,” she told us. “Further, it provided us capital for team expansion and further technology validation for remote monitoring of solar assets, thus bolstering our capacity to work at larger scale.”

That Oorja has a female co-founder in Chambon played into Cisco’s selection of its 2019 Grand Prize winner. “We’re trying to drive more inclusivity,” de Wysocki said. ""When you think about venture capital-backed startups, they are predominantly male. We’ve made a concerted effort to increase the number of female leads who are part of these startups.”

Chambon and Kumari predict that social enterprises and mission-driven startups will continue to play a crucial role in catalyzing development at the base of the supply chain and for underserved populations. India, in particular, is home to around 2 million social enterprises and has long been a dynamic hotbed for social innovation. But despite advances in its socio-economic development, the country still faces challenges in the fields of agriculture, education, healthcare, clean energy, gender equity, and equitable economic growth, among others. Soon to become the most populated country on earth, with a high density of people living together, India may prove to be a testbed for many sustainability solutions — and the potential of young entrepreneurs.

“It is imperative to enable India’s young people to reach their full potential, and for this to happen, India needs to become a more inclusive and prosperous society,” Kumari told us. “We see that the vibrant community of startups and social enterprises is gaining sustained interest and support from impact investors in India and internationally. If this trend persists, it will result in delivering hundreds of projects providing access to basic services and making dramatic changes in the lives of millions of people.”

The fifth annual Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is accepting applications through January 29, 2021, with an expanded prize pool of US$1 million. Learn more here.

It is time to end public investment in new buildings that burn fossil fuels for heating and cooking, locking residents into decades of pollution and undermining California’s climate progress. Next week, the Strategic Growth Council will have the opportunity to end the practice of spending cap-and-trade funds to subsidize new fossil-fueled low-income housing and instead focus funding on all-electric affordable housing powered with renewable energy—but will it?

MidPen's first all-electric affordable housing project with David Baker Architects: Edwina Benner Plaza in Sunnyvale, California. Keith Baker

The Council administers the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program to support new low-income housing developments with funds from California’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). The AHSC program has granted over $1 billion in funding to date. At its Nov. 17 meeting, the Council will consider updating guidelines for the program. Unfortunately, the current draft guidelines only award two points to projects that are all-electric, of 100 possible points used to select winning projects, which is not enough to make a difference. The Council should increase the points for all-electric buildings this year to ten points and—most importantly—make a clear public commitment to only consider all-electric buildings for funding in the next annual cycle.

Climate dollars must support the state’s climate commitments

As members of the environmental community pointed out in a recent letter, the purpose of the GGRF (which uses proceeds from the state’s cap-and-trade program) is to “facilitate comprehensive and coordinated investments throughout California that further the State’s climate goals.” However, the AHSC program continues to fund new affordable housing that runs on natural gas (a.k.a. fossil gas), which contradicts the urgent need to protect community and environmental health by weaning the state off fossil fuels.

Buildings that use efficient electric space heating, water heating, and cooking technologies emit zero pollution on-site. And when powered by electricity generated from emissions-free renewable resources like wind and solar, these technologies enable buildings to run on 100-percent clean energy.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) concluded in its 2018 Integrated Energy Policy Report that “[t]here is a growing consensus that building electrification is the most viable and predictable path to zero-emissions buildings” and is “essential to California’s strategy to meet its [greenhouse gas] reduction goals for 2030 and 2050.” A recent California Air Resources Board report similarly found that “[a]chieving carbon neutrality by 2045 requires ambitious near-term actions around deployment of…building electrification,” which is a least-regrets strategy across all policy-compliant scenarios.

Affordable housing must support community and resident health

Core priorities of the AHSC program are “reducing air pollution, improving conditions in disadvantaged communities,” and “supporting or improving public health.” But funding gas-reliant homes undercuts these objectives.

Appliances in buildings burn more gas than all the state’s power plants, and create significantly more nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. NOx is a precursor to ozone and particulate matter, which are key pollutants to curb in order to comply with state and federal air quality standards. All-electric buildings reduce NOx and ground-level ozone, improving air quality and benefiting public health. A recent study from the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health found that immediate replacement of all residential gas appliances in California with clean electric alternatives would result in 354 fewer deaths, 596 fewer cases of acute bronchitis, and 304 fewer cases of chronic bronchitis annually due to improvements in outdoor air quality alone—the monetized equivalent of $3.5 billion in health benefits per year.

All-electric affordable housing is achievable—and support is available for the transition

Low-income housing really can make the transition to all-electric, and in fact this is already happening. But we need clear policy to push the affordable housing community across the line to have all-electric become standard practice.

Many affordable housing developers have completed all-electric projects and have more in the pipeline, while many others are considering all-electric construction as momentum builds. For example, the Fresno Housing Authority, motivated by local air quality concerns, has been developing all-electric buildings since 2015 and has nine projects either built or in the pipeline.

Wakeland Housing and Development Corporation—with projects in San Diego, Los Angeles and Riverside counties—has one new development under construction and has completed one all-electric retrofit of an existing building. The company intends to have most of its future projects be all-electric due to environmental concerns. Wakeland also values the time and money saved in only connecting one energy service.

During a recent listening session with four California-based affordable housing developers, participants acknowledged that they see the market moving toward all-electric construction, but said their peers needed support in the transition.

Fortunately, help is on the way. The CEC will launch the BUILD program (SB 1477) in 2021. This will provide $60 million in direct incentives for new low-income housing that is built all-electric. The program will also be providing robust technical assistance to affordable housing developers to support their projects.

The support of the BUILD program, along with a clear signal from the Council to AHSC applicants, is the combination needed to transform the market for affordable housing. We urge the Strategic Growth Council to award more points for all-electric buildings in this funding cycle, and to make a public commitment to only consider all-electric buildings for funding in the next annual cycle.","Next week, the Strategic Growth Council will have the opportunity to end the practice of spending cap-and-trade funds to subsidize new fossil-fueled low-income housing and instead focus funding on all-electric affordable housing powered with renewable energy—but will it?

KEY TAKEAWAYS Low-cost de-carbonization technologies continue to improve, reducing the lower half of the cost curve by 20% from last year.

Clean hydrogen emerges as the breakthrough technology.

Financial innovation and a lower cost of capital for low-carbon activities have driven one-third of renewables’ cost deflation since 2011.

Thanks to advances in technology and financial innovation, as well as increased shareholder engagement, the goal of achieving net zero carbon is becoming increasingly more affordable, according to research from Goldman Sachs.

Climate change is altering the energy industry through technological innovation and capital markets pressure, and Goldman Sachs has constructed a “carbon abatement cost curve” for conservation technologies that are currently available in industries such as power generation, industry, transport, buildings, and agriculture. In its annual “Carbonomics” report, the firm said this cost curve shows the reduction potential for manmade greenhouse gas emissions through more than 100 different applications of conservation technologies.

Since last year alone, when it put out its inaugural “Carbonomics” report, Goldman Sachs estimates that the annual cost of 50% de-carbonization has been reduced by approximately 20% from $1.2 trillion per year to $1 trillion per year based on the latest updated 2020 cost curve. The report said that two-thirds of the cost deflation was driven by improved manufacturing efficiency through global scale, and one-third was driven by lower cost of capital.

“As we move higher on the abatement cost curve towards 70% de-carbonization, we encounter the harder-to-abate emissions in need of material technological innovation, and the cost curve takes on an exponential shape,” the report said. “This part of the cost curve has seen the greatest improvement year on year, mainly thanks to renewed policy support for clean hydrogen.”

This has resulted in an approximate 30% global annual cost reduction to $2 trillion from $2.9 trillion, according to the report, which estimates that some 35% of the de-carbonization of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions relies on access to clean power generation, with clean hydrogen being the second most scalable technology.

“Clean hydrogen addresses the tougher to de-carbonize emissions (industry, heating, heavy transport) that make up 20% of global GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,” according to the report.

Goldman Sachs said the 2020 cost curve results in a maximum 85% de-carbonization through conservation compared with 75% de-carbonization achieved at the same cost based on the 2019 cost curve, which contributes an additional 10% of de-carbonization potential.

“The ongoing downward trajectory of the cost of capital has been a key driver of the overall affordability and competitiveness of clean energy,” said the report. “In contrast, financial conditions keep tightening for long-term hydrocarbon developments, creating higher barriers to entry, lower activity, and ultimately lower oil and gas supply in our view.”

Goldman Sachs’ research also found that shareholder engagement has been a major contributor to the declining cost of capital for low-carbon projects.

“With global GHG emissions on a persistent upward trajectory over the past decade, investors have emerged with a leading role in driving the climate change debate,” said the report, “pushing corporate managements towards incorporating climate change into their business plans and strategies.”

According to Goldman Sachs, the number of climate-related shareholder proposals has nearly doubled in nine years, while the percentage of investors voting in favor of those proposals has tripled over the same period.

“So far, 2020 has been, despite the outbreak of COVID-19, another year of strong shareholder engagement on climate change,” said the report.

However, it added that investor pressure is not uniformly distributed across sectors and shows a clear bias toward energy producers over energy consumers. The report said that data since 2014 shows 50% of proposals target energy producers such as oil and gas companies, utilities, and coal companies, while only 30% of the proposals target the sectors that account for most of the final energy consumption.

Solar and wind are already the most affordable form of electricity in most places around the world.

The analysis builds upon other research showing how renewables are quickly spreading in power markets worldwide. Just last month, the International Energy Agency announced that solar is on the verge of taking over coal as the cheapest form of electricity for good.

However, BNEF’s Chief Economist Seb Henbest said there is an economic limit to renewables’ spread. At some moment, every country will reach a saturation point when technology no longer reduces generation costs. Every country varies due to local conditions, but the constraints suggest clean energy will gain up to a maximum of 70% to 80% of the market for electricity generation. This holds even in Europe, where they have the strictest policies encouraging renewables.

Henbest said in a presentation outlining the BNEF’s New Energy Outlook findings:

That level of penetration is far off in pretty much every market we look at. We’re not going to reach these limits anytime soon, and we can, of course, push past these limits.

Not only are renewables cheaper to generate, but they’re a lot more efficient too. For example, energy loss from generating electricity from wind is nearly 0%, whereas 65% of energy is lost in burning coal.

Furthermore, using electricity to power cars and heat homes uses less energy than burning gas. Driving an electric vehicle uses up to three times less energy than a gas-powered one. Similarly, heat pumps warm buildings several times more efficiently than traditional gas boilers. Meaning, the world would use less energy to generate the same electricity through electrification coupled with renewables.

Henbest said:

Overall, what this means is that we can get better end-use energy efficiency from using electrical processes and technology downstream. If we use renewables to generate electricity, we get gains mid-stream as well. Overall, this translates into maybe say two to three times less primary energy supply.

The green revolution does impact the shipping industry negatively, however. At the moment, moving fossil fuels around the globe accounts for a third of the cargo miles hauled by shippers – 70% of that being oil. But maybe if hydrogen fuel becomes widely used, it can save the shipping industry. The clean energy source would replace dirty oil, gas, and coal.","Solar and wind are already the most affordable form of electricity in most places around the world.
The analysis builds upon other research showing how renewables are quickly spreading in power markets worldwide.
Just last month, the International Energy Agency announced that solar is on the verge of taking over coal as the cheapest form of electricity for good.
For example, energy loss from generating electricity from wind is nearly 0%, whereas 65% of energy is lost in burning coal.
If we use renewables to generate electricity, we get gains mid-stream as well."

New Delhi: An overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels has served as a catalyst for global warming, pushing the Earth to its tipping point. Its impact is not only expected to put global food availability and biodiversity at risk, but also raise sea levels and increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods.

In his latest book ‘Fossil Free’, Sumant Sinha, founder of India’s leading clean energy company ReNew Power, seeks to explain how the world can make a practical transition to cleaner sources of energy.

The book, published by HarperCollins India, is due to be released on 12 November on ‘SoftCover’, ThePrint’s e-venue to launch select non-fiction books.

Over the last decade, there has been a major transition to sustainable energy, and Sinha’s book discusses the challenges, realities and complexities of the global and local energy industries. It also delves into the the trends and forces that drive energy transition.

The book explains how improved electricity infrastructure, decentralised smart grids, electric vehicles, energy storage, and market design are already providing clear pathways for the transition to greener energy.

With Fossil Free, Sinha shares his vision for energy that is not only clean, but also practical and affordable.

“Fossil Free chronicles the energy transition taking place around the world, and more importantly, in India. As we move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the structure of the energy sector will change irreversibly,” said Sinha.

“India is at the vanguard of this change and the book outlines a ‘carbon-light playbook’ for the country, showing how this energy revolution will create new opportunities for millions of Indians while also addressing the pressing issue of climate change,” he added.

Batteries can account for half of an electric vehicle’s costs. As such, the dream of affordable electric cars, with a driving range equivalent to their gas-powered brethren, will not be achieved until the cost per kilowatt equation is dramatically reduced.

Fortunately, several innovative companies are developing fundamental technologies which will enable batteries that are cheaper, more powerful, longer lasting and safer than anything currently on the market. Along with companies such as Sila Nanotechnologies and Ionic Materials an emerging star in this rapidly evolving segment of the clean energy revolution is Coreshell Technologies.

Founded in 2017 by technologists with experience commercializing frontier technologies, Coreshell’s unique solution integrates seamlessly with battery manufactures’ complex and exacting production lines. This frictionless introduction into battery facilities has accelerated Coreshell’s market adoption, enabling it to partner with some of the world’s largest players.

John Greathouse: Jonathan and Roger, thanks for making the time to chat. I realize the science underlying Coreshell is deep and complex, but in layperson terms, what is “electrode surface instability” and how does Coreshell address this issue? (Note: I’m an Advisory Partner at Entrada Ventures, one of Coreshell’s early investors. Jonathan and Roger’s remarks have been lightly edited for brevity and readability.)

Roger Basu: Great to connect. Essentially, every time you use your battery, you’re creating a layer of degradation inside the battery. That’s what causes your battery to start dying much faster over time. This layer forms on the surface of the anode and cathode (electrodes). We always use the analogy of a rust-like layer. The problem is that this “rust” continues to grow every time you charge or discharge your battery. With our technology, we can prevent this layer from forming. The analogy we use is that we’re “painting” the inside of your battery with our unique nanolayer coating.

Greathouse: OK – running with your rust analogy, your technology is akin to spraying the inside of a battery with a microlayer of rustoleum.

What was the genesis of the science behind Coreshell? Was the technology developed in a research setting that you later applied to battery degradation or did you set out to solve the problem at the outset?

Jonathan Tan: We started Coreshell because we realized that the cost and capacity of batteries are becoming the bottleneck in clean energy and transportation. As Roger talked about, to tackle this problem, we’re solving the fundamental degradation problem in both state-of-the art and next-gen lithium-ion batteries with our unique nanolayer coating technology. Our mission has been to use this innovation to lower the cost and increase the energy for battery manufacturers and sustainability-minded auto makers. It was the combination of both the science and the mission that drove us to start the company.

Basu: What makes us unique is our ability to dramatically improve energy density, safety, and cost per kilowatt-hour by up to fifty percent, while replacing one of the biggest bottlenecks in Gigafactory battery plants with a single, low-cost coating tool. No one else has shown the ability to create a nanometer-precise coating using a liquid-deposition process that allows for scalability - that’s not been possible before.

Through our previous experience, we happened to have a significant background in both thin-film deposition from solution-phase and electrochemistry / lithium-ion devices, so the core technical concept came from the combination of these past experiences.

Greathouse: You’ve both mentioned the term “bottleneck.” What does this mean in the context of EV (electric vehicle) battery production?

Tan: A major part of the puzzle is the cost of electric vehicles, which are way too expensive for average households. Batteries are thirty-five to fifty percent of the total cost of an EV - by far the most expensive item in the bill of materials. So, by enabling a lower-cost and higher energy dense battery, we can transform the electric vehicle market from a luxury item to something that’s democratized for everyone to afford.

As an example, Tesla has remained a leader in EVs in large part because of their leadership in battery technology and manufacturing. However, to reach the next levels of electric vehicle and battery production, major innovations in materials and manufacturing are still needed and that’s where Coreshell will be a key, enabling technology.

Greathouse: So, Coreshell’s technology will drive down the cost of EVs, while increasing battery capacity. What’s not to like?

Given the power of your value prop, what deals have you cut so far and to what extent is your technology in the market?

Tan: Our goal is to deliver a drop-in solution for battery producers. To do this, we’ve been working with major stakeholders along the entire battery production value chain. With BASF, we’ve demonstrated that our coatings can significantly improve their state-of-the-art cathode materials. We’re also working with tier-one battery manufacturers and automakers who are trying to overcome their battery cost and capacity limitations.

Basu: The exciting thing is we’ve been able to demonstrate dramatic improvements, such as a thirty percent improvement in energy density by raising voltage limits, as well as the ability to debottleneck some major manufacturing steps. We’re doing this while improving the safety of lithium-ion batteries, which is a combination that not many can claim.

Greathouse: In what ways are you impacting battery safety? Are treated batteries less likely to catch fire?

Basu: Exactly, by coating the inside of the battery, we can mitigate the initial degradation reactions that start the thermal runaway process and can lead to catastrophic fires.

Greathouse: Through its Gigafactory, Tesla has invested heavily in improving battery performance. Yet, the company was heavily criticized coming out of Battery Day – were the haters justified?

Basu: After watching Tesla’s Battery Day, we felt like what they announced was potentially really powerful. The thing that surprised us was the negative response from the public and general media afterwards. The fact that Tesla’s stock fell five points after telling the world that they are going to scale to three terawatt-hours of battery production while halving the cost per kilowatt-hour of batteries in the next five years was pretty remarkable.

Tan: Reading many of the responses that were published, it seemed that a lot of folks were expecting revolutionary advanced chemistries - like a single crystal cathode, which was the big rumor. I think it goes to show something that’s been trending for a while in the battery landscape: the hype surrounding novel battery chemistries which have only been demonstrated in tightly controlled lab environments often overshadows the truly meaningful innovations that can reduce battery costs at scale and accelerate clean energy adoption in the next five-to-ten years.

This is something that Coreshell has believed since we first started the company in 2017, way before Battery Day. For an innovation to make a fundamental difference in the battery market, it must be easily integrated into the rapidly scaling manufacturing landscape. We’re at a tipping point for battery production and the industry is not going to pause its scaling to reinvent the wheel for a completely disruptive chemistry.

Basu: It reminds me a lot of the industry I used to work for - Solar. In the early 2000’s lots of disruptive technologies were trying to overtake traditional silicon solar, but then everyone quickly realized that the solar market was already taking off faster than people predicted due to a combination of design and manufacturing innovations.

Greathouse: Ironic for Tesla to be punished for not hyping an emerging technology…

What battery innovations are on the horizon - do you think single crystal cathode technology will be imminently commercialized? I assume your technology is agnostic as to which advances eventually win in the market, or are there some advancements that would cause you to revise your approach?

Tan: The two major innovations we see are first, energy density improvements on the anode and cathode. Here, Coreshell’s coatings can be the key enabler for novel electrode chemistries that often sacrifice cycle lifetime for initial capacity. Also, we’re chemistry agnostic so we have the ability to solve critical issues regardless of the market direction. Second, on the manufacturing scale, it’s about being able to produce as many cells in as small amount of space as capital efficient as possible. These developments should get the world to a place where electric vehicles are at cost parody with combustion engines.

Greathouse: What innovations can we expect from Coreshell over the next five years… do you foresee remaining on the licensing path or do you envision a time when you produce your own batteries?

Basu: The next five years for us is all about scaling our technology and using our roll-to-roll processing tool to demonstrate to battery manufacturers and end-users how effective our coatings can be in enabling fast production of high-energy, low-cost batteries.

Tan: We’re excited to be launching our initial partnerships now and are in conversation with many of the leading stakeholders in the battery and auto industries. Getting our technology into the hands of major producers is our main goal. However, in the meantime, we also have an opportunity to produce our own batteries and introduce them in some lower spec applications like electric scooters, which is also a growing market that we’re excited about.

This next five years aren’t only critical for us, but we’re entering into the “era of the battery” across the industry. It’s an exciting step towards sustainable zero-emission transportation and energy storage that’s no longer just a luxury item and can be affordable for everyone. That’s the world we dreamt of when we first began Coreshell.

The country's premier research institute, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and the Research and Development Centre of Indian Oil Corporation Limited have entered into an agreement to develop biomass gasification-based hydrogen generation technology so as to produce affordably-priced fuel cell-grade hydrogen.

Under this MOU, IISc and IndianOil will work jointly on the optimisation of both biomass gasification and hydrogen purification processes. The developed technology will be scaled up and demonstrated at Indian Oil's R&D Centre at Faridabad.

Hydrogen generated from this demonstration plant will be used to power fuel cell buses as part of a bigger project being conceived by Indian Oil towards ushering in the country's hydrogen economy.

""The current initiative of producing fuel cell grade hydrogen from biomass is another step by Indian Oil together with the IISc, to bring hydrogen fuel into India's mainstream energy matrix while utilising the agrarian strengths of the country,"" Indian Oil Corporation's Director (R&D) Ramakumar said after signing the MoU.

He added that the technology envisaged under this programme would not only provide a cleaner energy option for India but will also be a step towards addressing the challenge of biomass waste.

Ramkumar claimed that hydrogen is a promising clean and green alternative to conventional fossil fuels.

""Hydrogen-based fuel cell technology is a sustainable green mobility solution for India. Fuel cell electric vehicles are powered by hydrogen and emit only pure water as tailpipe emissions. Fuel cell technology for an automotive application requires ultrapure hydrogen with impurities less than ppb level,"" he explained.

The new investments total $65 million, which Microsoft says will create more than 1,000 new affordable housing units in the Seattle region.

To reduce rents in existing market-rate housing in Bellevue and Kirkland, Wash., Microsoft will put $40 million into a fund operated by Urban Housing Ventures, a privately funded company focused on creating affordable apartments. UHV will use the funds to reduce the rent for 40% of units in three apartment buildings to middle-income levels.

UHV says the novel model allows investors such as itself to purchase apartment buildings and then lower the rents on some of the units without losing financial viability. The reduced rent allows buildings to operate at lower vacancy and turnover rates, offsetting some of the costs of converting the units, according to UHV. Other participants in the fund include Stream Real Estate, Freddie Mac, Washington Federal, Washington Trust, and Berkadia.

“We need fresh, creative approaches like this one to quickly bring new private sector financing and funding to address the affordable housing crisis – in our home state of Washington and nationwide,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement.

Microsoft will contribute another $25 million to the Washington State Housing Finance Commission to help acquire land for affordable housing. The Expanded Land Acquisition Program will offer loans to help affordable housing developers compete with commercial real estate buyers in the Seattle area’s hot market.

Microsoft launched its landmark affordable housing fund in early 2019 with an initial commitment of $500 million. The company added an additional $250 million to the pledge in January.

Several other tech giants in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area announced similar affordable housing programs in the wake of Microsoft’s commitment. The tech boom of the past decade has coincided with surging real estate costs in the two regions and many have called on companies like Microsoft to help mitigate the affordable housing crisis.

The RadMission offered all the familiarity of a traditional mountain bike form factor with the benefits of an electric motor and batteries for just $1,099. The question we had was whether the compromises necessary to achieve the lower price point impacted the functionality or quality of the bike. Thankfully, Rad Power Bikes sent a RadMission our way for us to run around town, up and down hills, to the beach out back to see what it was really made of.

Disclaimer: Rad Power Bikes sent us a RadMission free of charge for the purposes of this review.

The RadMission

The RadMission was born out of a desire to amp up the mountain bikes founders Mike Radenbaugh and Ty Collins grew up riding. Electrification was the future, but these cheap, lightweight bikes were what called them to bikes in the first place. There is a beauty to it. In their early years, bikes meant freedom. Freedom to explore. Freedom from the house. Freedom to live life on their own terms.

Life was simple back then and that simplicity found its way into the RadMission with a simple fixed gear that swaps out the flexibility provided by complex front and rear gears with a rear hub motor. Instead of leaning on gears to take the edge off of inclines, the RadMission leans on the 500-watt rear motor. This 500-watt motor is the smallest in Rad Power Bikes’ stable and is one of the ways they were able to bring the cost down.

Powering the motor is a 48V, 10.5 Ah, 504 Wh battery pack stocked with Samsung 18650 lithium cells. That’s smaller than the standard 672 Watt-hour pack common on Rad Power Bikes other offerings, but lines up nicely with the smaller motor. The result is an impressive 45 mile range per charge. As with ever ebike, this figure will vary depending on rider weight, assist level, terrain, and weather. In our experience, we were able to get close to the stated range even with a slightly over average rider weight.

Rad Power Bikes sent us the mid-step RadMission. Low-step ebikes are my personal preference as they make it easier to get on and off the bike. That is doubly true when the bike is equipped with front and rear racks, baskets, and cargo. Our RadMission came with the optional kickstand, and a range of purpose built accessories are available from Rad Power Bikes, though many are regularly out of stock.

The Experience

Heading out on our first ride of the RadMission, that simplicity was on fully display. The single 16-50 gearing is well suited to riding around town without assist and we found it to be a breeze to ride around town with. The 30mph speed achieved on a few of the downhill sections in the sprint exceeded the capacity of the gearing, but not by a significant amount.

The result is simplicity. It’s a throwback to simpler times. To beach cruisers and 5 cent candy. Not more clicking gears. Just pedal and go. If you need help on a short hill, just twist the throttle for full power and instant torque from the motor. Or tap the small controller on the left side of the handlebar to increase the amount of pedal assist the motor provides. It’s that easy.

Of course, there are those who will miss the gears, but the vast majority of casual riders putting less than 20 miles on the bike per ride won’t notice much of a difference at all. Smaller riders also won’t be as impacted as they can get farther on a single charge. Blasting around town, the bike delivered on the promise of fun mountain biking around town.

The battery and motor not only boost the riding experience, they also offset my out of shape legs. I ride tens of miles most weeks, but that’s hardly enough to correct for far too many hours sitting in front of my laptop trying to change the world with words. It’s like I have the strength I used to have when my bike was my only link to the outside world of school, soccer, friends, and family.

The weight of the RadMission, at just 48 pounds, is noticeable when blasting around town as it shaves off nearly 20 pounds from the weight most ebikes on the market. In case you didn’t catch it, we had a lot of fun on the RadMission. It far exceeded our expectations in just about every circumstance. The smaller motor and lack of gears were noticeable on some of the larger hills, but Rad Power Bikes has a range of fully built out ebikes to suit more aggressive riding.

Most ebikes eschew standard tire sizes in favor of more plush balloon tires as a way of adding a bit of extra cushion in the ride without have to add any suspension to the frame. The RadMission keeps it simple with a set of 27.5 x 1.95″ Kenda Kontact puncture-resistant tires that are a breeze to motor around on.

Overall

The RadMission does carry forward many of the fundamental design tenets of the classic mountain bike in a simpler, streamlined ebike package that won’t break the budget. In my time reviewing it, I found it to be a great fit for my wife, where the 500-watt motor had no issues carrying her lighter weight up even the steepest hills. She actually preferred the lack of gears on the RadMission, quickly propelling it to the top of her list of favorite ebikes.

After spending some time on the RadMission, it is a clear leader for smaller riders and riders living in areas without significant elevation changes. The straightforward design of the RadMission ensures it will find a place as a no-nonsense commuter to work, to class, or just around town. The lower price point also makes it a great first ebike for anyone looking for a more affordable entry point into one of the most reputable companies in the space.

POAH is developing the Loop at Mattapan Station on an underutilized MBTA parking lot adjacent to the Mattapan trolley line station. The 135 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of first-floor retail space will be contained in a six-story building and constructed using the latest passive house energy efficiency standards. All 135 apartment homes will be deed-restricted and affordable to households across a broad range of incomes, from very low income residents to moderate-income families, and will include 30 new workforce housing units.

“The Loop at Mattapan Station is a showcase for MassHousing’s mission-driven work of creating affordable housing for working families and building stronger communities,” said MassHousing Executive Director Chrystal Kornegay. “We are pleased to join POAH, the Commonwealth, and the City of Boston in transforming this underutilized parking lot into 135 new rental homes that will connect residents to economic opportunity for many years to come.”

“The Loop at Mattapan Station builds on the City of Boston’s goals to create new housing in our neighborhoods that serve families and residents at a range of different incomes,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “Today’s announcement is an important step forward for this project and I thank our partners at the state for sharing our mission to invest in affordable housing opportunities that will help Mattapan and neighborhoods across Boston prosper and thrive.”

“POAH is excited to be collaborating with Nuestra Comunidad, the MBTA, and our other development partners on this important and innovative project and we are grateful for the financial commitments from the City of Boston, the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development, and MassHousing. The Loop at Mattapan Station will provide much-needed affordable and workforce housing for this dynamic community while offering neighborhood-scale commercial space. It will also serve as a welcoming gateway to the Neponset River Greenway, connecting the neighborhood with a unique recreational resource,” said POAH President and CEO Aaron Gornstein.

POAH is developing The Loop at Mattapan Station as part of a joint venture with the non-profit Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation, which has had a focus on the community engagement for the project.

MassHousing provided a total of $36.5 million in affordable housing financing to POAH affiliates in a pair of related transactions. The Agency provided POAH with a total of $17.4 million in permanent financing, $16.1 million in tax-exempt bridge financing, and $3 million from the Agency’s Workforce Housing Initiative.

Other financing sources include a total of $39.3 million in tax credit equity from an allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), allocated by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). DHCD also provided $5.35 million in direct support for the project. The City of Boston contributed $2.9 million in affordable housing funding. The project also benefits from $1.8 million in public infrastructure funding from the Commonwealth, and $540,000 in passive house funding from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center. Bank of America will provide construction financing and is the tax credit investor.

Overall, the Loop at Mattapan Station will contain six studio apartments, 38 one-bedroom apartments, 81 two-bedroom apartments and 10 three-bedroom apartments.

Eighteen apartments will be restricted to very low-income households earning at or below 30 percent of the area median income (AMI) and those units will be supported by project-based vouchers through the federal Section 8 and the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Programs (MRVP). There will be 47 apartments restricted to households earning at or below 50 percent of AMI, 28 apartments restricted to households earning at or below 60 percent of AMI and 42 apartments restricted to households earning at or below 80 percent of AMI, of which 30 will be designated as workforce housing units. The AMI for Boston is $119,000 for a household of four.

The Loop at Mattapan Station advances the Baker-Polito Administration’s goal of creating up to 1,000 new workforce housing units affordable to middle-income households through MassHousing’s Workforce Housing Initiative. Since the inception of the initiative in 2016, MassHousing has committed or closed workforce housing financing totaling $97.1 million, to 49 projects, located in 20 cities and towns. To date, the Workforce Housing Initiative has advanced the development of 4,418 housing units across a range of incomes, including 1,237 workforce housing units.

The general contractor for the building will be Dellbrook | JKS. MacKay Construction will complete the MassWorks-funded infrastructure work. The architect is The Architectural Team, and the management agent will be POAH Communities.

MassHousing has financed nine rental housing communities in Mattapan involving 612 housing units and $96.3 million in total financing. The Agency has provided $1.1 billion in mortgage financing to 8,535 Boston homebuyers and homeowners who refinanced their homes.","BOSTON – MassHousing, the non-profit Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH), and the City of Boston announced the closing of $36.5 million in MassHousing affordable housing financing for the development of the 135-unit The Loop Mattapan Station, a new affordable and workforce housing community in Mattapan Square.

But contrary to what some people think, plant-based doesn’t necessarily mean you must forego all animal products. Rather, you might just eat meat or dairy products less frequently, or in smaller portions. To replace those lost calories, you should eat more beans and legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. These mostly low-fat, nutrient-rich foods have been linked to improvements in many health-related issues, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.

Better for your budget and the planet

A plant-forward diet also can help reduce your food budget. And there’s yet another reason to feel good about this eating pattern: it helps preserve our planet’s health. A diet that contains only small amounts of animal foods requires a fraction of resources such as water, energy, and land to cultivate, and it generates fewer greenhouse gases. What’s more, by eating unprocessed or minimally processed foods, you avoid the additional energy and packaging that go into the production of processed foods.

“Following a plant-based diet may be an important way to reduce your carbon footprint,“ says Teresa Fung, adjunct professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Research suggests that diets high in red meat account for five times the emissions of plant-based diets.

How much plant food should you aim for if you want a truly sustainable diet? In early 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, and Health — a multidisciplinary group consisting of 37 leading scientists from 16 countries — described the type of diet needed to support a world population of 10 billion by the year 2050 in a healthful, sustainable way. Its report urged people to double the amount of fruits, vegetables, and nuts they eat, and reduce consumption of red meat and added sugars by at least 50%. The recommendations are quite a departure from what most Americans eat — allowing for only a single 3.5-ounce serving of red meat per week. The commission included a graphic representation of its “planetary health plate” that shows just how much of a person’s overall diet should come from plant-based sources.

Easy plant-based dinner recipes

If you need some inspiration for moving toward a plant-based diet, try these easy recipes from Monique Tello, MD, MPH. Both contain a variety of veggies and are very adaptable — simply swap in your favorite vegetables or those you happen to have on hand. Frozen or low-sodium canned veggies are a convenient and still nutritious alternative to fresh produce.

Print Easy Frying Pan Frittata This recipe works very well with frozen veggies. For dinner, this can serve two to three people. Add a side salad, if possible. Ingredients 1/2

eggs Instructions Use a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat and heat oil until shiny. Add the onion, stirring until just soft Add the peppers. Stir until the onions and peppers are very soft and just browning. Add the spinach/greens to the pan and stir until wilted and hot. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them up with a fork until they’re uniformly yellow and a little foamy. Pour the eggs over all the veggies, turn the heat to low, and cover the pan. Shake the pan a few times during cooking, which more evenly distributes the eggs and prevents sticking. Check frittata after three to four minutes. If the eggs look done, loosen it with a spatula to make sure there is no runniness. If there is, cook thirty seconds to a minute longer, covered. Using a spatula, slide frittata gently onto a large plate and serve. We slice this up like a pizza.","Rather, you might just eat meat or dairy products less frequently, or in smaller portions.

City Commissioner Sean Logan cast the lone dissenting vote. Logan said he feels the resolution has been rushed and such a program should include more community input than the two public meetings at which the resolution was discussed.

Logan also question the financial feasibility of such a fund.

""I think it's clear that our budget still needs a significant amount of work,"" he said. ""I think committing to this while there exists a significant imbalance in our general fund is not a good direction to set.""

He cautioned the commission against making ""another unfunded commitment of public money when there are really a lot of financial unknowns outstanding.""

""In this year alone, we've made commitments to clean energy, sidewalks, significant development on Cruse Avenue -- just to name a few -- without really defining the financial impacts that those initiatives will have on the public..."" he said.

Haladay called Logan's comments ""off-base"" and ""false.""

""I didn't hear a single specific concern articulated by Commissioner Logan with regard to the actual language of this resolution,"" Haladay said. ""We apparently had such a good budget this year that the five of us decided to give nearly a quarter of a million dollars to the golf course, and we're concerned about putting pennies into a fund for affordable housing.""

356,https://www.kold.com/2020/11/12/solution-affordable-housing-crunch/,"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",KOLD,A solution to affordable housing crunch,"TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - Affordable housing is an issue in Tucson. Reports show only about 70 percent of the housing in Tucson is affordable. Nearly half the renters spend 30 to 50 percent of their income on housing.

In order to address these issues, the Tucson City Council will explore the idea of Accessory Dwelling Units.

These are not the tiny homes that many people might have seen in recent years. ADU’s take it a step further.

“Usually there’s a bedroom, a living area, a full kitchen, that really part of the idea,” said Koren Manning, a planning administrator for the city of Tucson. “So they can be 600 to 800 square feet is very typical.”

What sets them apart is the full kitchen. Zoning regulations prohibit guest houses or casitas from having a full kitchen. It will take a vote of the council to change zoning to allow for a kitchen to be part of the unit.

“It’s about how you can create a living unit that really works for the resident,” she said. “Whether it’s a tenant, whether its an elderly family member, a small family, a couple.”

It’s not a new concept, it’s been floating around the country in places like Portland where housing prices have skyrocketed.

It makes better use of available space, adds to the affordability housing stock and battles gentrification which has become an issue here.

And it will help the population as it ages by allowing them to avoid nursing homes and congregant living spaces.

“I see that it will be a very valuable tool for helping seniors age in place,” Manning said. “And helping people with elder care issues that we know are becoming a huge issue in our community.”

If the council approves moving forward there will be public hearings and community engagement before moving forward.

The process could take six to nine months.

357,https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/11/30/Rethinking-Affordable-Homes-Climate-Fight/,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",TheTyee.ca,How Rethinking Affordable Homes Connects with the Climate Fight,"Earlier this year, Vancouver city council approved a new downtown condo tower pitched as one of the greenest skyscrapers on the planet. It “will quickly become a blueprint for future towers in cities around the world,” said the architecture firm behind 1075 Nelson, a 60-storey development in the West End that will be built to Passive House standards.

“The planet is on fire,” Rick Gregory, vice-president at Henson Developments, said of using ultra-efficient windows, insulation and ventilation systems resulting in much less energy requirements than a typical tower. “You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.”

Because 25 per cent of the building’s floorspace will be set aside for social housing, Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart also portrayed 1075 Nelson as a step towards addressing the city’s dire affordability needs.

“We’re in a housing crisis, and this is a building on private land with private financing, and we’re still getting 102 social housing units,” Stewart said.

Just down the road from 1075 Nelson is another skyscraper competing for eco-bragging rights in what aims to be the world’s “Greenest City.” The “Butterfly” tower being built by Westbank boasts of “sustainability goals exceeding LEED Gold.”

But when Samuel Stein looks at luxury towers with the latest green technology, he doesn’t necessarily see progress on climate change. “It makes the problem worse as it claims to make it better,” the New York-based housing policy analyst and author of Capital City told The Tyee.

That’s because when such developments market homes to the wealthy for millions of dollars, they drive up already high land prices, he argues. Even those that include some social housing don’t really reverse that trend. “They produce more units in general, but it makes the immediate area much more expensive,” he said.

And those high land prices also drive up greenhouse gas emissions.

Research from Californian cities shows that when lower-income people are forced further from the downtown core into areas with sparser public transit, they become more reliant on private vehicles — and there is reason to think this is also happening in Vancouver. That is a worrying trend, because emissions from private vehicles are currently one of the biggest barriers to the city and region achieving climate targets.

There’s another paradox to building high-priced condos that meet top environmental standards and command sweeping panoramas of nature. They often are purchased as second homes by rich globe-trotters. Though many luxury housing developments in Vancouver meet stringent green building codes, additional research suggests that the climate gains could be eroded by the larger-than-average carbon footprints of their high-income residents.

“That kind of dense living can be climate friendly but there’s no guarantee the people don’t own cars and fly planes all over the place and sit on yachts half the year and all the other stuff the rich do that is incredibly bad for the environment,” Stein said.

To Stein this requires a rethink of what “sustainable” actually means in an urban context. It can’t just be green technology, narrowly-focused emissions targets and well-wishes of developers and private business. “On every ground that’s not solving the problem,” he said.

The two ‘defining’ crises of our era

If you stopped a random Canadian on a city street and asked them to name the issues that worry them most, housing affordability and climate change would likely be near the top. Polls ranked these as top-three issues during the lead-up to the 2019 federal election. Even with coronavirus upending normal life, the climate emergency is a still a number-one source of concern for 31 per cent of Canadians, according to a September Abacus survey.

And so are out-of-reach home prices. About 84 per cent of people across the country think the federal government’s coronavirus recovery efforts should include investments in affordable housing, an August survey conducted by Nanos Research suggests.

Typically, a warming climate and scarce affordable housing are seen as discrete issues with separate causes, consequences and political coalitions. “Housing fits awkwardly into left climate debates,” explains University of Pennsylvania assistant professor of sociology Daniel Aldana Cohen, who helped research housing legislation for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.

Even environmentally forward cities like Vancouver and Berkeley have struggled to implement zoning changes that would make single-family neighbourhoods denser and more walkable.

Large build-outs of new affordable homes could, if not done to stringent climate standards, strain our planet’s already tiny carbon budget due to the construction industry’s huge environmental footprint.

Researchers at McGill University have meanwhile linked investments in bike lanes to increasing home prices and gentrification in cities like Chicago and Portland.

But some affordability experts argue that the housing and climate crises share more in common than they appear. “I see them as not competing crises,” Leilani Farha, a former United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing who now, from Ottawa, helps lead a global affordable housing movement called The Shift, told The Tyee. “They are defining of our moment in history.”

Both of these crises are major sources of anxiety for Canadians. Both of them are exacerbated by business decisions that put private profits above public goods — whether developers building luxury condos that drive up land prices, or oil companies that construct emissions-spiking pipelines. And, an increasing number of experts are realizing, a failure to solve one crisis can make it difficult, if not impossible, to solve the other.

Shoved to the sprawling suburbs

After Andrea Reimer was elected to Vancouver city council in 2008, the Vision majority she belonged to under former mayor Gregor Robertson set two huge goals — to end homelessness and make Vancouver the greenest city in the world. By the time she left city politics in 2018, however, the number of people without homes was at record highs. And though the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell roughly 12 per cent, that reduction was still short of the 33 per cent decrease by 2020 called for by the Greenest City Action Plan.

“I’ve had time to see how difficult it is to make change from a low position of power,” she told The Tyee of trying to solve systemic crises with scant support from the federal Conservative government of then-prime minister Stephen Harper or successive provincial BC Liberal governments. But the experience of using her council seat to push developers to include affordable units in luxury developments built to high standards of sustainability also taught her another lesson.

“You can’t solve the worst problems of capitalism with more capitalism,” Reimer said. “It doesn’t work that way on climate or housing.” Still, she adds, “I also don't regret trying given that it was the only option on the table at that time.”

As the price of an average detached home rose to stratospheric heights, lower-income people have been pushed to the edges of Vancouver, or further out into communities like Burnaby, Richmond and Surrey, according to research from the University of Toronto’s David Hulchanski. Here, they are significantly less likely to bike to work (four per cent) than high-earning people (11 per cent). Though both groups drive at around the same rate (60 per cent or so), lower-income residents of Metro Vancouver are more likely to have commute times of an hour or more (13 per cent) versus wealthier residents (eight per cent).

“Because the majority of low-income neighbourhoods are car-oriented sprawl, this is likely due to design rather than preference,” Christopher Cheung wrote in The Tyee.

Policymakers seem to be aware of this disparity. “The design of policies and programs should consider how low carbon options for transportation and buildings can be accessible to all Metro Vancouver residents,” reads a regional report called Climate 2050. Vancouver’s recently approved Climate Emergency Action Plan promises that “climate justice” — meaning solutions that account for income, racial and other disparities — “will be a key part of our work, aiming to overcome historic discriminatory City legacies.”

Yet the plan contains no mention of making housing more affordable. And in the meantime, lower-earners’ reliance on cars is increasing. From 2017 to 2018, “there was a higher proportion of auto trips among lower-income households (40 per cent compared to 36 per cent in 2017),” reads a city report.

This is a major climate problem for the city and region. Though transit use increased slightly across Metro Vancouver from 2008 to 2017, more than 70 per cent of trips across the region are done in private cars, recent TransLink data shows. Regional emissions are so far only one per cent below 2010 levels, far from the 45 per cent reduction targeted for 2030. The top source of emissions — more than one-third — is on-road transportation. As CBC reports: “Cars are still king of the road throughout the region.”

This appears to be a national phenomenon. From 1996 to 2016, the number of commuters who worked over 25 kilometres from a city centre increased in seven major Canadian cities including Vancouver. “This is related to the preference for single-family homes on larger and more affordable lots, located further away from the city core,” Stats Canada concluded.

And it’s a challenge many American cities are also facing. Researchers in California have found that despite the state’s aggressive climate policies, greenhouse gas emissions are increasing because unaffordable home prices are forcing people to make long commutes in their cars. “Put more directly, in order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the housing crisis,” two experts argued last year in the New York Times.

Tale of two carbon footprints

The idea of fixing climate change by creating denser neighborhoods reliant on public transit or other non-vehicle forms of travel dates in Vancouver back to before 2006, when then-mayor Sam Sullivan introduced the term EcoDensity. But though the concept is now widely regarded as one of our most potentially effective means of lowering urban emissions, it comes with an important caveat: the homes can’t only be for millionaires.

Otherwise, as researchers have documented in cities like Helsinki and New York, the carbon savings you get from denser communities are offset by the higher-than-average consumption patterns of their wealthy inhabitants. University of Pennsylvania sociologist Cohen has calculated that per-capita carbon footprints in New York’s West Village are up to three times higher than similarly dense parts of the Bronx, where incomes are much lower. “For low-carbon densification to work, you need to ensure affordability,” he told The Tyee.

That also applies to someone who can afford to pay $4 million or up to live in a LEED-certified tower in downtown Vancouver. Members of B.C.’s top income quintile produce 27 per cent more emissions than the average person, according to a 2010 report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

Did the NDP Do Enough to Fix BC’s Affordable Housing Crisis? read more

Oxfam Canada calculates that the richest 10 per cent of Canadians were responsible for as many emissions through their frequent plane trips, secondary homes and comparatively lavish purchases as the poorest 50 per cent of people in the country.

What this means to Seth Klein, the former B.C. director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and author of the book A Good War, is that cities like Vancouver can’t make meaningful progress on the climate emergency without also addressing the market-driven inequality that exacerbates it. “There’s a remarkable parallel between housing and climate change,” he explained. “You have to tackle them together.”

358,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/supreme-court-appears-willing-to-leave-obamacare-in-place-.html,"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",CNBC,Supreme Court appears willing to leave Obamacare in place,"""I think it's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate was struck down,"" Roberts told Hawkins, noting that the same Congress ""did not even try to repeal the rest of the act."" Roberts was appointed by President George W. Bush.

But Roberts and Kavanaugh suggested that would not doom the rest of the law.

The court's six conservatives seemed sympathetic to arguments made by Kyle Hawkins, the Texas solicitor general, and acting Justice Department Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall that the individual mandate became unconstitutional when it was stripped of an accompanying penalty.

The Trump administration, via the Department of Justice, argued in favor of the red states' challenge.

The Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012 under Congress's taxing power, but Texas and other Republican-led states argued that the reduction of the penalty made that justification no longer workable, and as a result the whole Affordable Care Act must be struck down.

The individual mandate provision, as enacted in 2010, requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. The GOP-controlled Congress reduced the penalty to $0 in 2017.

""Today, I think the winner in this case was the Affordable Care Act and Congress,"" Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said in an interview after arguments concluded.

Such a decision would leave in place the central aspects of the 900-plus page legislation, which collectively have transformed American health-care over the past decade, from the expansion of Medicaid in dozens of states to the requirement that insurers cover those with preexisting conditions.

Chief Justice John Roberts, who cast the key vote in 2012 upholding Obamacare, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of President Donald Trump, suggested that the court may cast aside a challenged provision of the law, known as the individual mandate, while leaving the rest of it standing.

During arguments in a case seeking to eliminate Obamacare, two of the court's conservatives on Tuesday signaled they would not strike down the landmark legislation.

The Affordable Care Act seems likely to withstand its third challenge at the Supreme Court.

Roberts acknowledged that some Republican lawmakers may have wanted the Supreme Court to strike down the law, ""but that's not our job.""

Kavanaugh told Donald Verrilli, who was solicitor general under former President Barack Obama, that ""I tend to agree with you that this is a very straightforward case"" and that under the court's precedents ""we would excise the mandate and leave the rest of the act in place.""

Verrilli was arguing on behalf of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which along with a coalition of Democratic states led by California was defending Obamacare. Michael Mongan, the solicitor general of California, argued on behalf of the blue states.

Later, Kavanaugh told Hawkins that it ""sure seems"" like Congress in 2017 wanted to lower the individual mandate penalty without getting rid of the Affordable Care Act's other provisions, such as its protections for those with preexisting conditions.

While Republicans in Congress repeatedly threatened to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act, the party was never able to muster a majority in the House and Senate willing to do so. An effort at the ""skinny repeal"" of certain provisions, including the individual mandate, failed in 2017 after the late GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona cast a vote against the effort.

Michael Kimberly, a partner at the law firm McDermott Will & Emery who co-chairs the firm's Supreme Court and appellate practice group, said that Kavanaugh's comments were ""strikingly direct.""

Kimberly said that Kavanaugh's comments were out of character, suggesting the judge was trying to signal how he would rule in the case.

""I think the defenders have reason for cautious optimism,"" Kimberly said.

The court's three liberals, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan appeared ready to side with the blue states and the House of Representatives. It takes five votes to gain a majority on the nine-judge panel.

The Democratic-appointees seemed skeptical of the red states' argument that the mandate was unconstitutional, and sympathetic to California's claim that those states lacked even the ability to sue, given their failure to prove that they had been harmed by the law.

""The only thing that changed is something that made the law less coercive,"" Kagan said.

Breyer suggested that allowing the red states to bring their claim could open up challenges to all sorts of laws that would be unlawful if they included penalties, such as hypothetical statutes calling for citizens to plant trees, clean up yards or buy war bonds.

The court's conservatives seemed more amenable to the claim from red states and the Justice Department that the law's challengers had been harmed.

Roberts noted that if Congress passed a law requiring everyone to mow their lawn once a week, even if there was no penalty, there ""will certainly be injury"" to those who didn't comply. Justice Clarence Thomas said that such a law could still have a ""chilling effect.""

A ruling siding with the red states by invalidating the individual mandate, but with the blue states by allowing the bulk of the Affordable Care Act to remain standing, would represent a win for Democrats.

Health-care activists said that if the Supreme Court struck down the Affordable Care Act, more than 20 million people could lose their insurance.

The dispute, which was argued in the shadow of last week's presidential election, was a central focus of Democrats during the confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett last month.

After the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal, died in September, Democrats sought to turn the fight for her replacement, Barrett, into a referendum on the law.

In that regard, Barrett's questioning on Tuesday was anticlimactic, as it didn't provide much insight into her thinking about the legal issues.

The case had also become a political flash point in the race between Trump and President-elect Joe Biden, who have sketched out vastly different visions for the future of American health care.

Trump pushed to gut the Affordable Care Act, while Biden's agenda calls for building on the law, which the former vice president played a role in shepherding through Congress in the first place.

The political stakes were amplified by the pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 in the U.S. and made health care a more salient issue. Efforts to contain the pandemic also caused a devastating recession, which has resulted in millions losing their health-care coverage.

""The elephant in the room happens to be the political tenor behind all of these issues,"" Goodwin said. She noted that given Trump's attacks on the federal judiciary, the chief justice has had to project an air of neutrality more than previous leaders of the court.

""The chief justice is having to call balls and strikes, and in such a way that it is clear the court does abide by the rule of law, and the court under his jurisdiction will not be partisan,"" Goodwin said.

""How much of that he controls is limited,"" she added. ""The reality is this is a court that has been affected by the political tenor of these times.""

Ahead of the case coming to the Supreme Court, two lower courts sided with Texas, including the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals court, and agreed that the individual mandate was unlawful. The appeals court, though, did not say whether the rest of the Affordable Care Act would also have to be struck down.

Arguments, which were scheduled to last for 80 minutes, began at 10 a.m. ET and concluded around noon. They were conducted by phone as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and streamed live to the public.

A decision in the case, known as California v. Texas, No. 19-840, is expected toward the end of June.","The individual mandate provision, as enacted in 2010, requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.
The Affordable Care Act seems likely to withstand its third challenge at the Supreme Court.

More supportive housing opportunities and property management that is willing to lower barriers on screening. While the city/county focus on expanding emergency shelter for homeless, those sites should be just a stop gap, an emergency situation, until permanent housing can be obtained. Many people grew up with different social circumstances around us and some households may need help navigating systems in different ways than others. We also have households who have had some bad luck in their lives. Maybe they made a few poor choices in the past. We need to give people the opportunity to secure housing and not always look at past mistakes.

What are the major shortcomings of our system?

Besides adequate shelter and housing opportunities, we need to create better coordination with mental health and crisis response systems. I think the county and city are trying to take those steps in the 2021 budgets.

In June, amid a broader and long-running debate over whether to encourage high-density development in the growing suburb, the city council narrowly rejected a previous $900,000 offer on the land from the housing authority, which has proposed building a 254-unit apartment complex in a neighborhood the city hopes to revitalize.

The city subsequently put the property on the open market, and received its highest offer from the Plano Housing Authority, according to city documents.

Mayor Harry LaRosiliere and council members Maria Tu, Anthony Ricciardelli, Rick Grady and Kayci Prince voted in favor of the sale last week.

Council member Shelby Williams voted against it, along with council members Lily Bao and Rick Smith. Williams questioned whether the housing authority’s planned development would generate more property tax revenue for the city than other proposals, and argued that the $2 million would be a fraction of the total value of the land over time.

As part of the sale agreement, the Plano Housing Authority will partner with MVAH Partners and Auxano Development to build a multi-family development oriented toward the Parker Road DART rail station. The complex will have affordable and market-rate units, according to city documents.

Plans also call for the housing authority to lease adjoining property at 2501 K Avenue to re-develop the tire shop there into “an open space that will enhance its planned development,” according to city documents.","About four-and-a-half acres of land at the northwest corner of K Avenue and Park Boulevard will be developed into mixed-income housing after the Plano City Council voted 5-3 last week to sell the city-owned property to the Plano Housing Authority for $2 million.

In the U.S., it’s estimated that some 30 million adults ages 18 and older are living with diabetes and 84 million with pre-diabetes. While these dire statistics aren’t going to change overnight, the power to change our health is in our hands, a new study says. One of the simplest things we can do to change our risk? Go plant-based.

Back in August, we reported on a study out of the University of Bergen in Norway, that found that plant-based diets help you metabolize glucose, lose weight (particularly for people who are overweight), and prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Now, we’re back with more encouraging news for implementing a plant-based diet as an affordable, effective way to ward off type 2 diabetes.

A plant-based diet is recommended for those with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes

In a recent review published in Practical Diabetology titled “The Affordability of a Plant-Based Eating Pattern for Diabetes”, the paper’s author, nutritionist Meghan Jardine, MS, MBA, RDN, LD, CDCES, Associate Director of Diabetes Nutrition Education, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, recommends that anyone at high-risk go plant-based and that doctors and nutritionists should make it clear that there are affordable options when ditching meat and dairy.

“Plant-based eating has become more popular as a healthy eating pattern for the prevention and treatment of diabetes,” Jardine writes. “Both observational and interventional studies have reported that plant-based diets reduce diabetes risk as well as improve diabetes outcomes,” she later states, referencing this 2016 comprehensive review on the use of a plant-based diet for management of type 2 diabetes.

Worth mentioning: When it comes to eating a plant-based for diabetes management or prevention, it’s important to consider carbohydrates. It’s heavily processed, refined carbohydrates—like white bread and chips—you want to avoid. As Jardine points out, “A healthy, affordable, plant-based diet is high in [carbohydrates]. Patients with diabetes are often told to avoid foods high in carbohydrate, as these foods have the greatest effect on postprandial glucose levels.” She also notes that studies, such as this 2017 study from the Journal of Geriatric Cardiology, show “that a high intake of carbohydrates, such as whole grains and cereal fibers, are associated with a reduction in diabetes risk, whereas refined carbohydrates increase risk.” (For more on healthy carb options, check out our guide to whole grains here.)

A plant-based diet is actually cost-effective, contrary to what people think

While vegan eating may have the rap as a costly lifestyle, as Jardine argues and research supports, eating a healthy, plant-based diet can actually be quite wallet-friendly, and even save you money compared to other dietary regimes with animal products. Some healthy, affordable plant-based options the piece suggests include apples, bananas, oranges, broccoli, spinach, carrots, whole wheat bread, rolled or steel-cut oats, quinoa, black beans, pinto beans, and peanut butter, to name a few.

Buying foods when they’re in season and purchasing items like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains in bulk can also go a long way in reducing spending. Ditto for shopping the frozen aisle for fruits and vegetables—just make sure there is no added salt, sugar, or other icky ingredients—and loading up on vegan pantry items when they are on sale.

""Wanda SD gives our customers peace of mind that their facilities are clean and safe by killing more than 99 percent of harmful pathogens.""

Wanda SD features a 42-inch tall light tower with dual UVC lamps that sanitize the air and surfaces such as desks and tables. UVC spotlights underneath the vehicle scour the floor, destroying pathogens in its path. At 253.7 nm, UVC radiation breaks down the genetic material of bacteria and viruses. The robot cleans approximately 200 square feet in just 15 minutes. Even more impressive, it can cover up to 7,200 square feet over a 12-hour period before requiring charging thanks to its lithium ion phosphate battery that provides three times the power at half the weight.

When disinfection of a room is complete, a text message is sent by the vehicle's advanced software system. The software also keeps a running log of where and when all tasks were finished, as well as how long the UVC lights were on, for current and future verification.

The Wanda SD model is easily guided from a separate location using nearly any smart device, including smartphones or tablets. Exposure to UVC light can be dangerous to eyes and skin. To protect workers, the vehicle is equipped with two levels of perimeter monitoring via a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) and ultrasound that detect when someone enters an area being sanitized. When this occurs, the UVC lamps automatically turn off.

At just 42"" tall with a 17""x17"" base, Wanda SD is versatile enough to navigate through tight spaces. The base is 3D printed from environmentally friendly, biodegradable polymer material. In addition to disinfection, Wanda SD can transport more than 200 pounds of packages and mail.

""Our experienced team of engineers, designers and manufacturing experts have built the most robust, reliable and cost-effective robot for protecting the public against dangerous germs,"" said Patel. ""Wanda SD is designed and manufactured in the U.S.A. from U.S.-made components to reduce costs for our customers and make delivery of replacement parts quicker and easier.""

365,https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/pixel-4a-review-this-affordable-google-phone-is-a-winner-despite-limitations-120111600240_1.html,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Business Standard,Pixel 4a: This affordable Google phone is a winner despite limitations,"From the Apple iPhone SE to the OnePlus Nord, this year has seen the return of some big names in the smartphone space to the business of making affordable The next in line is global software giant Google, which recently launched the Pixel 4a in India. The Pixel 4a claims to bring some of the best features from at a reasonable price of Rs 31,999. But is it worth your money? Let’s find out:

Design

It is hard to find an Android smartphone, especially a midrange one, with good ergonomics and a compact form factor. Thankfully, the Pixel 4a has both. You will love the Pixel 4a’s in-hand feel, and it is surprisingly sturdy despite its polycarbonate build. Moreover, its lightweight design (143g) makes it comfortable to hold and operate, and it feels like air while resting inside the pocket.

Display

The Pixel 4a’s design is accentuated by the 5.8-inch OLED screen (fullHD resolution) with a punch-hole on the top-left corner to accommodate the front camera. The display stretches across the borders, leaving minimal bezels – something that previous Pixel could not pull off. The screen is bright, vivid and responsive. It has a good contrast and seems suitable for most content you consume on a smartphone screen.

The phone supports the always-on display mode to show relevant information even when the phone is locked. Also, there is the ‘Now Playing’ feature that recognises a song playing in the background and shows its details on the locked screen. Interestingly, the ‘Now Playing’ feature works without internet connectivity and is right on the spot in recognising songs, including those from Bollywood. The Pixel 4a also has a stereo speaker set-up which is something few phones in this segment boast.

The speakers are loud and clear, and work well for almost every utility. There is a 3.5mm audio out port for wired headset connectivity. Though a small feature, it adds a major value here, considering are quickly ditching this feature in the interest of bigger batteries or to reduce the overall thickness.

Camera

Imaging has always been Pixel’s strong point and the experience in the Pixel 4a is similar. Though it lacks the multi-optics set-up which limits its usage to regular point-and-click, the 12.2-megapixel rear camera is a capable one – it works seamlessly across light conditions. Its natural output might not impress everyone but shutterbugs who prefer natural colours to saturated or overly processed images would love it.

There is also an option to save images as RAW files, so you can tinker with image settings for the desired result. However, it is a pro feature, so every user may not be able to benefit from it. In the auto mode, the photos come out with plenty of details and clear distinctions of contour. For low-light imaging, there is a dedicated night mode, which is one of the best you get in any smartphone. There is also the astrophotography mode, which gets automatically activated through the night mode when the phone is mounted on a tripod or any other stable object. Despite featuring a mono lens, the Pixel 4a does portraits better than most other smartphones. The portrait mode also extends to phone’s 8MP front camera, and results come out clean.

Performance

The Pixel 4a is powered by Qualcomm’s midrange system-on-chip (Snapdragon 730G), which is slightly underpowered if you compare it with the Snapdragon 765G that powers the OnePlus Nord. Yet, it does not show any weakness or stutters while performing its duties. The phone works well for regular operations and handles processor- and graphic-intensive jobs with ease. The phone’s 3,140 mAh battery keeps the show going for around a day on normal usage. The charging time is good, but not exceptional. The phone comes with an 18W USB type-C charger, which replenishes a completely drained battery in around two hours.

Verdict

The 4a justifies its pricing by offering almost everything that you expect in a midrange smartphone. From a captivating design to a dazzling OLED screen, loud stereo speakers, and a no-frills performance, there is nothing to complain about in this phone. It is a go-to smartphone which would have been a perfect fit if it also had some sort of ingress rating for water and dust resistance. But the Pixel 4a is still a perfect smartphone in this segment. Pick this one if you need a smartphone with good in-hand feel without having to compromise on other important factors.","The Pixel 4a claims to bring some of the best features from at a reasonable price of Rs 31,999.

Ahead of a presentation to be delivered with CEO Mary Barra Thursday at Barclays Global Automotive Conference, Doug Parks, GM's executive VP for product development, purchasing, and the supply chain, explained why the company is upping its intended 2020-2025 investment in all aspects of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion, from $20 billion announced last March.

General Motors' BEV3 platform and Ultium batteries

According to Parks, the company has pulled a number of EV programs ahead versus even earlier in the year—like the Cadillac Lyriq, as well as some models not yet shown—and it’s made continued investments in further development of its battery chemistry.

“Building your own cell is priceless,” he said, underscoring that without its own battery development and the joint venture with LG Chem, called Ultium Cells LLC, it wouldn’t be able to plan profitable, more affordable vehicles in the near future.

A company release accompanying the stepped-up plan stated that it now plans “EVs at all price points for work, adventure, performance, and family use.”

That includes models priced right in the heart of the market, in the $35,000 range, and perhaps below, Parks hinted, responding to questions about how low that means. “We'll certainly be in the high-volume segments,” he said. “And then as that cost comes down we’ll continue to drive that even farther.”

GM Ultium battery

Parks again emphasized that a single-cell strategy—and realizing economies of scale with it—makes that possible. GM can configure the same large-format pouch cells used in all of its future Ultium-powered electric vehicles horizontally or vertically into modules, with single- or double-layer packs and the potential—as in the Hummer EV—for 800-volt charging.

GM is now anticipating to get to cost parity with internal combustion vehicles soon after the launch of the Ultium vehicles, which is set to start next fall with the release of the Hummer EV. Ultium packs, by the kilowatt-hour, will cost 60% less than today’s packs, with twice the energy density, by the middle of the decade. A 40% drop in cost will be realized right off the starting line, according to Parks, with the launch of the Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq.

Because of incremental propulsion developments, GM can now claim a range of 450 miles for that top battery of more than 200 kwh, although not necessarily in the bulky Hummer EV.

Counting on those economies of scale for batteries, GM now says that it plans to launch 30 different new global EV models, with 20 of those available in North America. Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet, and Buick will be represented in the product rollouts.

That consists of three other GMC variants, including another EV pickup; four Chevrolet EVs, including a pickup (above, and styled somewhat like the Avalanche, as we've noted before) and compact crossover; and four new Cadillacs. A slide notes an especially shortened timeline for a second GMC electric pickup and a Chevrolet compact crossover.

GM EVs pulled ahead - November 2020

GM is already running durability testing on its “nex-gen Ultium” cells that would be phased in around the middle of the decade in a wide range of vehicles already in production. The cells will help GM meet affordability targets with fewer cells needed for the range people expect.

Parks pointed particularly to an affordably priced C-segment crossover, somewhat like the Chevrolet Equinox, but with a different mission. ""As we get volume on that C segment SUV, and we get volume on ourselves, and we get the new chemistry, by mid decade that continues to create our ability to offer vehicles at lower and lower prices.”

GM still plans on a million EVs by mid-decade. “There will be additional battery volume cell volume required, so we’re already planning for that,” Parks said, confirming that will eventually require expanded capacity at the Ohio battery plant.","A 40% drop in cost will be realized right off the starting line, according to Parks, with the launch of the Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq.

All member states and the Saarc Secretary General Esala Ruwan Weerakoon participated in the meeting which was chaired by Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar.

The meeting was preceded by the Saarc Planning Secretaries’ Meeting on November 23, 2020, which was also hosted by Pakistan virtually to lay the groundwork for the ministerial meeting. The meetings discussed national SDGs approaches, impact of COVID-19 on economic growth in the South Asian region and a strategy for collective action for development financing in the wake of the pandemic.

In his opening remarks, Asad Umar briefed the member states about Pakistan’s national SDGs policy. He noted that political ownership for SDGs is manifested at the highest level as Pakistan was one of the first countries to adopt SDGs as national development agenda through a unanimous parliamentary resolution. He also highlighted Pakistan’s success in devising a coordinated approach taken by government of Pakistan towards its social protection and environment conservation initiatives such as the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami.

He expressed hope that the meeting would shape Saarc countries’ response for mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable groups of Saarc societies and efforts to accelerate the successful implementation of SDGs targets within the region. In this regard, he emphasised affordable and effective provision of COVID-19 vaccine for Saarc countries, which seems vital keeping in view the fact that the region is home to one-fourth of global population and further 96 million people in the region live in extreme poverty. He further deliberated the importance of debt relief and availability of concessional financing for the Saarc region in order to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic proficiently. He indicated that Prime Minister Imran Khan has already extended the concept of ‘Global Initiative for Debt Relief’ to provide much-needed fiscal space to the developing countries currently faced with worsening financial meltdown due to the pandemic and Saarc countries can join their voices for this common initiative. He noted that Pakistan continues to extend its unconditional support to strengthening coordination and cooperation to all the Saarc member states for the greater benefits of vulnerable groups within the region. He expressed hope that this initiative by Pakistan, and the meeting report adopted by all member states with consensus, will go a long way in devising a coordinated strategy towards achieving SDGs in the region, especially in the post-COVID environment.

The Saarc planning ministers and secretaries virtual meetings were a reaffirmation of Pakistan’s commitment to the Saarc process and its efforts to forge closer cooperation among member states. All member states and the Saarc secretary general appreciated Pakistan’s timely initiative of organising the meetings on such an important subject.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan hosted the inaugural meeting of Saarc Planning Ministers Wednesday on the theme: ‘Shaping the Saarc Vision 2030’ in virtual mode.

Available in Europe and North America at a later date, the N10 5G costs £329 (US and Australia pricing weren't released yet, but that converts to roughly $430 and AU$600). This is cheaper than the £379, UK-only OnePlus Nord, and much lower than the company's cheapest flagship model, the OnePlus 8, which is currently discounted at $599 and £549 (AU$837 converted).

The Nord N10 5G does cut a few corners. For instance, it has an LCD display instead of OLED, it doesn't have an in-screen fingerprint sensor, it's powered by a slower processor than any 2020 OnePlus phone, it isn't IP rated for water resistance and it runs the older Android 10 OS. But it still has some premium features, such as 5G, a 90Hz display and a robust 4,300-mAh battery, as well as a few retro surprises that no new OnePlus phones have, like expandable memory and a headphone jack.

Affordable price Don't Like Macro and low-light photography is unimpressive

If US pricing stays consistent with the UK, it'll be one of the more affordable 5G phones available, landing between the $360 LG K92 and the $445 Motorola One 5G. Though I do think the Pixel 4A 5G and One 5G are worth the extra bit of money (the $500 Pixel phone, for instance, will get the latest software support from Google, has an excellent camera and a long-lasting battery life), the N10 5G is a top choice if you're a fan of OnePlus and want 5G at an affordable price.

N10 5G's familiar design touches

The N10 5G has a dark blue, glossy design that looks polished and slick. From afar it doesn't look like a ""budget"" phone. But when I first picked it up, I could tell it wasn't as high-end. It's heavier and thicker, and its bezels, especially the bottom chin bezel, is wider than all of the phones OnePlus released this year. It also doesn't have the convenient toggle switch for silence/vibrate that OnePlus phones are known for. Nonetheless, it's still a relatively attractive device, and its rounded edges on the side are comfortable to hold.

The N10 5G also has an LCD display, whereas OnePlus phones usually have AMOLED screens. When viewed side-by-side with the Nord, the AMOLED screen is a bit brighter and vibrant, with more contrast. I also noticed that when viewing the N10 5G from various angles, the color shifting was more noticeable. But these details are only discernible next to another phone. By itself, there is no real issue with the N10 5G's screen, and watching videos and photos looked sharp and clear. Its 90Hz refresh rate makes scrolling through feeds and apps feel zippy and smooth.

Lastly, unlike many of OnePlus' new phones, the N10 5G has two things that are familiar but have been missing from many premium devices: a headphone jack for wired headphones and a visible fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone that works quickly.

N10 5G's has four rear cameras, but it only needs two

Similar to many OnePlus phones, the N10 5G has four rear cameras, and similar to those phones, it really only needs two. The standard and ultra-wide cameras are great and are the ones I used the most, but the monochrome camera is only useful when you want to take black and white photos, which I hardly do. And the 2-megapixel macro camera for closeup shots takes photos that look like, well, they were taken with a 2-megapixel camera. While it did allow me to focus in on an object and get super close to it, pictures ultimately looked washed out and muddy.

But again, the standard and ultra-wide cameras are quite excellent. Photos were sharp with rich contrast, and the camera's HDR effect is vibrant. The standard camera defaults to 16-megapixel, but you can shoot at the full 64-megapixel resolution. The camera's 10x digital zoom is also decent, and was able to capture details of faraway objects despite being a tad blurrier.

The N10 5G's low-light mode, called Nightscape, wasn't very impressive however. While taking a photo of a black bookshelf in near darkness, I was able to see a few more details and book titles. But the picture remained relatively dark still and when I compared the same scene on the OnePlus Nord, the One Plus 8T and the Pixel 5's Night Mode, all three phones brightened up the scene a lot better.

N10 5G's battery and performance

The phone is equipped with a Snapdragon 690 processor. Though on paper that's not as fast or as powerful as the OnePlus Nord, Motorola One 5G and the Pixel 4A 5G's Snapdragon 765 chipset, the N10 5G tracked closely with the phones when it came to benchmark tests. I also didn't notice any speed issues or laggy behavior during my time with the phone.

Geekbench v.5.0 single-core OnePlus Nord N10 5G 604 Google Pixel 4A 5G 573 Motorola One 5G 587 OnePlus Nord 618 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance

The N10 5G has a beefy 4,300-mAh battery, which is the same capacity as the more expensive OnePlus 8. Anecdotally, the phone can easily last a day or two without a charge with mild usage. At the end of one particular night, the battery was only at 70% after I took the phone out during the day to take a bunch of photos and browse the internet. Battery tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode averaged 16 hours, 27 minutes. For comparison, the OnePlus 8 lasted longer, at nearly 19 hours.

N10 5G's software and interface

When OnePlus launched its 8T in October, it also updated the company's OxygenOS interface, refreshing menus and notifications so that they looked more streamlined, modern and clean. I was a fan of it, so it was disappointing not to see it on the N10 5G. This is likely because the phone runs the previous version of Android, Android 10, but even if the N10 5G doesn't run Android 11 out of the box, it's still possible for OnePlus to tweak some parts of the N10 5G's interface with the most recent OxygenOS look. But the N10 5G is expected to receive one OS update (from Android 10 to Android 11) and a total of two years of security updates according to OnePlus.

The N10 5G does still have useful software features, including a native screen recorder, Dark Mode and ZenMode, which is OnePlus' digital wellbeing app that limits phone functionality when you want to focus.","With the Nord N10 5G and N100, OnePlus is expanding its more affordable ""Nord"" family of phones after launching its first OnePlus Nord in July.

The launch comes as there is a gradual attempt by the Government towards the restoration of normalcy in India while it still grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hand hygiene would be a key factor in keeping the virus in check and successfully returning to the new normal. Handwashing is a simple yet primary preventive measure to stop the spread of COVID-19. Through the handwashing stations, VisionSpring endeavors to make handwashing accessible to all and promote the necessary behavioral change. This was another milestone by VisionSpring in its fight against COVID-19 in India after touching close to a million people so far this year through its COVID-19 response and relief activities and provision of PPE kits and essential commodities.



The launch was made at a webinar organized on 3rd November by VisionSpring to stress on the importance of hand hygiene and handwashing and how this simple practice can save millions of people from COVID-19 and help halt its rapid spread. Eminent speakers such as Ms. Shipra Saxena, Water and Sanitation Specialist, UNICEF, Mr. O. P. Singh, Head, Program Implementation (Health and Nutrition), Save the Children, Ms. Aparajita Singh, CEO, Gautam Gambhir Foundation, and Ms. Chandra Ganapathy, Head, Knowledge Management, WaterAid India, participated in the webinar. They shared their views on the challenges and the solutions and emphasized the need to make hand hygiene accessible through handwashing stations. Two models of handwashing stations, 500 liters and 20 liters were launched in different color variants. More than 350 participants from across India and abroad attended the webinar and gained immensely from the proceedings.



Ms. Noopur Srivastava, Director, Partnerships, India, VisionSpring, said, “VisionSpring conducted a Rapid Assessment Survey in April 2020, and the results illustrated the gap between hand hygiene facilities and hand hygiene practices. 52% of participating facilities lacked handwashing stations at entry. Of these, 76% were eye hospitals, and another 6% were district/tertiary hospitals or medical colleges. Hand sanitizers may kill viruses and certain bacteria, but they do not clean your hands as soap and water do. These findings resulted in us deciding to design and make ergonomic and affordable handwashing stations from scratch to fill the gap that existed and make handwashing with soap and water accessible to all.”","Hand hygiene would be a key factor in keeping the virus in check and successfully returning to the new normal.

He added that the Ministry of Health wants 300-400 million doses by July 2021.

Poonawalla was speaking to reporters after PM Narendra Modi’s visit to SII.

He said: “We are talking about how and where to distribute doses with the government and also we indicated a price which is affordable to everybody and accessible to everybody. So, at the moment till we get emergency use license we probably won’t be able to comment on how many doses will go where.

""We have to wait for few weeks for that to happen, but I think everybody is aware that Ministry of Health wants 300-400 million doses by July 2021 so we are trying to get to that target.”

He added that SII has not yet signed any document with the government to provide doses.

“We are producing 50-60 million doses a month and after January- February that will be scaled up to 100 million doses per month. The vaccine will be distributed initially in India and COVAX countries mainly in Africa. The UK and European markets are being taken care of by AstraZeneca and Oxford. If they need help in scaling up their manufacturing we are away there to support them. But our priority is going to be India and COVAX countries” he added.

Poonawalla said that panic and negative messages about Covid-19 vaccine will create doubts in the minds of people and India will have a situation where vaccines are available but people avoid them.

Poonawalla said: “In the world today where everyone is questioning vaccines and vaccine hesitancy we should collaborate together, the media, manufacturers, government of India and everybody to send the right messaging out and not spread any panic and negative news unnecessarily without getting down to the facts.”

He added its only when the facts have been confirmed messages about the vaccine should be sent out.

“We don’t want to build doubt in the minds of people today, especially in the time of the pandemic and have a situation where vaccines are available but some people are hesitant to take them because they bit unsure or skeptical of safety.”

Poonawalla added, “I feel we should only put out messages that are properly confirmed in terms of fact-checking from the Ministry of Health and the manufacturers before we put anything and create any negative panic around vaccines because we need to project the power of vaccines and how they can save our lives and our children.”

When asked if Serum planning to conduct additional trials post the recent results which have been announced by AstraZeneca. “ No, because at the moment the trials are more than enough. There was a bit of confusion in communication which will be explained in the coming days. But that is not going affect the emergency use license in UK and India.”

The Serum Institute will apply within two weeks for the emergency use of the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and pharma giant AstraZeneca.","Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO and owner Adar Poonawalla said that the SII is discussing with the government on the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine and has indicated the price would be affordable to everyone.

5G would positively impact India’s telecom market, the second largest in the world and “still growing”, as increased data consumption and heightened adoption of technology due to the pandemic has prepared the market for the advent of next-generation technology, said Rajen Vagadia, VP and President, Qualcomm India and SAARC.

“The case for the immediate rollout of 5G networks in India is a compelling one. It is no longer a choice, but a pre-requisite for the country’s growth and development,” Vagadia told PTI.

Indian regulators will have a big role to play in ensuring that 5G in India is deployed to its “full potential”.

As the world’s second largest telecom market, India holds huge promise for growth, Vagadia said.

“The government and policy makers can trigger growth of the Indian telecom market by releasing spectrum, including 5G, in adequate quantity and at affordable prices,” he said in an email interview.

Since networks are congested, it is “prudent” to make the spectrum across all bands including mmW (millimetre wave) available for immediate deployment, starting with trials, he said.

5G will completely redefine mobile experiences and enable generations to benefit from it, the company said.

Tech titan, Qualcomm, is a wireless technology innovator and fuelling the development, launch and expansion of 5G.

“We are driving conversations at all levels of the ecosystem to catalyse the commercial reality of 5G in the country -- from telco, education, healthcare, automotive, medicine to manufacturing,” Vagadia said.

India has a big market that needs to upgrade and set up for 5G growth, he pointing out.

“We expect a longer-term trial followed by circle level rollout towards the end of next year before a national rollout of services,” he pointed out.

Unlike previous generation technologies, 5G is expected to embrace and support specialised use cases in sectors like manufacturing, energy, utilities, healthcare, pharmaceutical, transportation and logistics. To support the connectivity needs for the next decade, 5G will play a “much bigger role” than previous generations of technology, spanning multiple industries and verticals.

“That says it all, in terms of the opportunities that India has, from leveraging 5G,” Vagadia said.

Qualcomm is already working with several partners in India and around the world to enhance technology inventions in 5G.

Qualcomm and Reliance Jio, India’s largest telecom operator, said they have aligned efforts on 5G, in order to fast-track development and rollout of indigenous network infrastructure and services in India.

Earlier this year, Reliance Industries (RIL) announced that Qualcomm Ventures will pick up 0.15 per cent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 730 crore. The latest progress on the 5G product portfolio neatly dovetails into Jio’s overall plans to develop homegrown 5G telecom solutions, as was outlined by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani during the company’s annual general meeting in July this year.

On the whole, though, this is a pleasant enough place to be, if not quite as upmarket as some of the best rivals.

With the Puma, then, it probably won’t be love at first sight. But spend a little more time with it – and more importantly, get it out on the road – and the chances are it’ll end up finding its way into your affections.

The Telegraph verdict

As we’ve already mentioned, we really rather like the Puma. However, what we hadn’t yet discovered was the best news of all: the best version is also the most affordable.

True, if you upgrade to the ST-Line you get slightly smarter looks. But you also spend a chunk more cash, and lose that climate control along the way. Given how much you get as standard with the Titanium, we reckon that makes it much better value – and a smarter buy than the more expensive variants.

This least potent engine hasn’t dented our enthusiasm for the Puma, either. In fact, by contrast, it’s strengthened it. The little mild hybrid punches well above its weight, pulls out some deeply impressive economy figures, and manages to feel gentle and easy-going in town, gutsy on the motorway and eager on a country lane.

The rest of the Puma’s genius is still intact. This is still a practical, versatile and very clever little car with that’s blessed with a terrific chassis – even in this most wallet-pleasing form. Buy cheap, buy twice, runs the old adage – but in this case, that couldn’t be further from the truth.

The rivals

Volkswagen T-Cross 1.0 TSI 115 SE

113bhp, 47.1mpg, £20,690 on the road

Practical and pretty comfortable, the T-Cross is the kind of small SUV you buy with your head – but not your heart. Inside, the cheap plastics let it down, and the driving experience, while pleasant, is a big scoop of bland compared with the Puma’s. And while this SE version is cheaper to buy, it comes with fewer toys, less power and higher fuel consumption.

Nissan Juke 1.0 DIG-T 117 N-Connecta

115bhp, 47.9mpg, £21,460 on the road

The latest Juke boasts eye-catching looks, spacious rear seats and a decent-sized boot, though admittedly, not quite as spacious as the Puma’s. Its chassis isn’t quite as adept, either, though it’s still quite good fun to drive, and reasonably comfortable. And this reasonably high-end model matches the Puma for spec, yet costs a touch less.

Suzuki Vitara SZ-T Hybrid

With its mini-Range-Rover looks and willing engine, the Vitara’s a likeable little car, and comes with the benefit of lots of space given it’s slightly bigger than the Puma. It also comes with a mild hybrid engine, just like the Puma. But it lacks polish, the interior feels a bit cheap in places, and the Vitara therefore feels rather expensive for what it is.

New Delhi, Nov 29 (IANS) When smartphone makers like Motorola and Samsung are busy launching high-end foldable display smartphones, LG has joined the bandwagon with launching a dual display device at an affordable price.

The new LG Velvet is priced in India starting at Rs 36,990, whereas the LG Velvet Dual Screen combo is priced starting at Rs 49,990.

Currently, it is the only handset in the sub-Rs 50,000 price point that offers a foldable smartphone experience.

Let us find out how the Dual Screen combo device in black colour performs for its Indian fans.

The Velvet doesn't look like any other phone LG has launched to date.

It features a tall and slim look. The phone has a metal-glass sandwich design with both the front and rear sides being curved.

The right side of the phone houses the power button while on the left, you will find volume buttons and a Google Assistant key.

A SIM card tray with microSD card expansion is placed on top of the phone, and a USB-C port, speaker and headphone jack at the bottom.

The smartphone comes with a case for a secondary display with all the important buttons and ports.

The case ships with a magnetic connector for Type-C charging port so that a user doesn't have to take out the phone every time to plug it into charging.

The dual-screen accessory has cutouts for the audio jack and bottom-firing speaker.

Additionally, the Velvet also comes equipped with a hybrid SIM card tray, offering a microSD card to expand the phone's built-in memory.

The LG Velvet has a P-OLED 6.8-inch main screen with an aspect ratio of 20.5:9 and a resolution of 2460×1080, 60Hz refresh rate.

The sunlight legibility of the device is good. One won't be squinting his/her eyes to read text or view a photo on the phone.

We do wish LG added a screen refresh rate option faster than 60Hz. Refresh rates of 90Hz or higher are commonplace on other mid-range and flagship smartphones.

The sides of the display are curved, which certainly looks modern.

The smartphone incorporates a second 6.8-inch screen to the regular monitor of the Velvet. In the Dual Screen case, there is also a 2.1-inch display where alerts and other information can appear.

LG has a custom web browser called ""Whale for LG Dual Screen"" created especially for its Dual Screen.

With the help of a secondary display, one can read the news on one display and watch YouTube videos on the other one.

One can also use the primary display as a gaming console while gameplay runs on the secondary screen, for a console-like gaming experience.

The LG Velvet has a triple camera setup at the back that houses a 48MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 lens, PDAF, and 79-degree field of view. There is an additional 8MP secondary sensor with a wide-angle f/2.2 lens and 120-degree field of view.

Lastly, there is a 5MP depth sensor with an f/2.4 lens and an 81-degree field of view.

The phone also has a 16MP camera sensor at the front for selfies and video chat that is paired with an f/1.9 lens and offers an 81-degree field of view.

In daylight testing, nearly all of our shots looked crisp, with excellent depth of field. The smartphone offers solid performance in low-light conditions as well.

Selfies came out nice, even if a bit overexposed. However, the images were not as sharp as what you get on the front camera.

The device captures video in up to 4K at 30fps with its mainframe, 1080p at 30fps and 60fps are available as well. The ultra-large coverage is limited to 1080p at 30fps.

The LG Velvet India model is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC instead of the Snapdragon 765G found on the global version.

The phone packs 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. There is an option to expand storage further using a microSD card (up to 2TB).

The phone's performance is smooth for day-to-day tasks like multitasking between social media apps, watching a video and sending emails.

Facial recognition on the phone is decent and the in-display fingerprint sensor, we found, is a much better option.

LG Velvet has a battery power of a 4,300mAh with Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ support.

Fully charged, the phone easily lasted for more than a day on moderate usage.

If you want to use it for playing games and streaming movies, then you have to plug-in to the charger for twice a day.

The Velvet runs on Android 10 with no complex menus and the interface is clean.

Conclusion: No doubt LG Velvet is the finest phone in terms of design and performance in its category that we reviewed recently.

Still, it would be not an easy task for LG to compete against OnePlus as well as Samsung foldable devices in terms of consumer satisfaction and brand trust.

Affordability is one factor that works perfectly in the LG Velvet case as you will not find a Dual Screen device at this price.

Projectors have come a long way over the years in quality, performance, price, and value. While some are geared toward home theatre setups, there are others that go the super-affordable and portable route. Of course, there are plenty of these options on the market to choose from.

Our Vankyo Leisure 430 review takes a look at a portable projector that offers up a pretty decent picture given its size and cost. Read on for our full review.

Specifications

The Vankyo Leisure 430 portable projector has the following features and specifications: Model Vankyo Leisure 430 GC333 Display technology LCD Light source LED Resolution 800 x 480 (native) Contrast ratio 2000:1 contrast ratio Input signal 576i, 576P, 720i, 720P, 1080i, 1080P Installation type Front/Rear/Ceiling Aspect ratio 4:3/16:9/Auto Projection distance 3.9 to 23.6′ Projection size 40 to 236 inches Lamp life 50000 hrs Focus Manual Keystone +/- 15° Speaker 3W/4ohm Power supply 100V-240V, 50/60Hz Photo format supported BMP/JPG/PNG/GIF/JPEG Audio format supported ACC/MP2/MP3/PCM/FLAC/WMA Video format supported AVI/MP4/MKV/FLV/MOV/RMVB/3GP/MPEG1/MPEG2/H.264/XVID Ports HDMI in, USB 2.0, VGA, AV in, Audio out, SD Card slot Mounting screw 1/4-inch Dimensions 220 x 170 x 90mm (8.7 x 6.7 x 3.5in) Weight 1.22kg (2.68lb)

Design

Like most projectors, the Vankyo Leisure 430 is rectangular in shape with rounded edges and corners. The lens is located on the front of the projector on the left side. An IR sensor sits in the middle and the Vankyo logo is printed on the right. The entire front face is covered with a clear plastic cap as well, giving it an interesting finish.

The left side of the projector is where you’ll find the power input and air inlet for ventilation. The right side has the air outlet, audio out, AV in, SD card slot, USB port, HDMI port, and VGA port. Another air inlet and IR port are on the back of the projector.

The top of the projector is where you’ll find the focus and keystone correction rings behind the lens. Towards the back of the projector are your five buttons. The first says OK and has a silver d-pad ring around it. To the right of it (when looking at the back of the projector) is your back button, input source, menu button, and power button.

Save The right side of the Vankyo Leisure 430 projector.

Finally, the bottom of the projector has four padded feet, the speaker grille, and a ceiling mount screw hole that also accommodates the included front height adjustment foot.

The projector isn’t anything out of the ordinary when it comes to looks. It is also nice and compact in size, coming in at about 9-inches wide, 7-inches deep, and 3 1/4-inches in height.

The included remote is pretty small and compact as well. Black in colour, it is roughly 5 1/2-inches by 1 1/2-inches by 1/2-inch thick. There are nine buttons, a directional pad, and a volume toggle on the remote. The buttons from top to bottom allow you to power the unit, mute the volume, fast reverse, play/pause, and fast forward. Below those is the directional pad with an OK button nestled in the middle. Underneath the pad are three more buttons for back, menu, and changing the input source. Finally, the volume down and up button is below that.

Display

I’ve been spoiled by 4K projectors for a couple of years now, including the Samsung LSP9T, so I’m going to try and be as objective as I can with this lower resolution projector. While it accepts 1080p input, its native resolution is only 800×400.

Setup is pretty easy and the Vankyo Leisure 430 comes with both a focus and keystone correction ring. That being said, I found it really hard to focus the projector when it was tilted at most angles. While the keystone made the picture square, I could only get the middle of the picture to focus properly while the edges were blurry. The more keystone correction applied, the blurrier the edges of the projector. The easiest way to focus the projector is to have it sit on something at the appropriate height for a mostly rectangular picture by default.

Save The front of the Vankyo Leisure 430 projector.

The Vankyo Leisure 430 isn’t very bright, and works much better in darker rooms without a lot of ambient light. If you’re planning on using this in a living room, you’ll want to close the blinds. If you don’t, the picture quality will be light and looked washed out. Once you are in a darker setting, the picture actually looks pretty decent for a 1080p projector. Colours aren’t too bad, and once you get it focused properly, it is pretty clear, albeit 1080p resolution.

As for picture size, I was easily able to get over 100-inches and still being able to focus. At that size, you’re looking at setting the projector up at about twelve feet from your wall. While the projector can supposedly project up to a 236-inch picture from 28′ away, Vankyo recommends an 80-inch picture (from about 9.84′ away) for the best image quality.

There are a few limited picture options that you can change on the projector as well. These include:

Picture mode: Vivid, Standard, Soft, User (Contrast, Brightness, Color, Sharpness, Tint)

Color temperature: Cool, Medium, Warm, User (Red, Green, Blue)

Aspect Ratio: Auto, 4:3, 16:9, Zoom1, Zoom2, Just Scan, Panorama, Point-to-Point

Noise Reduction: Off, Low, Middle, High, Default

Projection Direction

Reduce Display Size

Overall, for the price point and the fact it’s not even a 1080p projector, the picture quality is pretty decent.

Ease of Use

The Vankyo Leisure 430 projector is pretty easy to use. Simply plug it in, connect the source, SD Card, or USB stick you want to use, and turn it on. Select the proper source and away you go.

Performance

As far as performance is concerned, the Vankyo Leisure 430 portable projector performed just fine. It started up fairly quickly and runs just fine, although the fan is a bit loud if you’re sitting close to it. The longest I ran it for was about four hours and it didn’t feel overly warm or anything. Switching between various inputs worked as one would expect. I was able to stream content from a laptop and console via HDMI, a smartphone via a USB-C HDMI adapter, and a Chromecast with Google TV via HDMI. Playing supported content from a USB drive and SD card worked without issue as well.

Sound Quality

The Vankyo Leisure 430 projector has a single down-firing 3W speaker on board. It does get pretty loud and the sound is crisp at full volume, but don’t expect any bass or surround type sound. For most rooms, 50% volume was plenty for listening to most shows and even music.

There are a few sound option settings you can adjust as well:

Sound Mode: Standard, Music, Movie, Sports, User (Treble, Bass)

Balance

Auto Volume

While the audio could be better, for a projector its not too bad.

Accessories

The Vankyo Leisure 430 also includes a nice little travel bag with a carry handle. Cloth on the outside, the case is mostly black in colour with a grey bottom. The Vankyo logo is printed in white on the front. A double zipper goes up each side and meets at the top. When unzipped, the front of the bag flips open and there are two compartments. The first is for the projector and has two straps to hold it in place while the second is for your cables and other accessories. In addition, the top flap has a pouch in it for storing the user manual and included cleaning supplies.

Save The Vankyo Leisure 430 projector in the included carrying case.

It’s simple but it works and is nicely padded. While it won’t prevent damage if you toss the bag around, it should protect the projector just fine from minor bumps and the like.

Price/Value

As far as projectors are concerned, the Vankyo Leisure 430 portable projector is very affordable. It is currently selling on Amazon for US$119.85. While I wouldn’t use it for my main projector, it’s great for a kids’ room or watching a movie in a non-typical location like the backyard or camping.

The Asokore-Mampong Housing Unit, now referred to as Osei Tutu II Housing Estates, is part of six (6) housing projects started by the Kufuor administration in 2005, with the others situated at Borteyman, Kpone, Koforidua, Tamale, and Wa.

It will be recalled that the Affordable Housing Project was started with the objective of providing accommodation for low to middle income workers, and also to build the capacity of local contractors among others.

However, upon the assumption of office of the Mills/Mahama administration in 2009, the project stalled. In 2017, the new Board of Trustees of SSNIT, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Kwame Addo Kufuor, took steps to fast-track the completion of the then abandoned project, in line with the President's commitment to provide affordable housing for Ghanaians.

The Board subsequently approved a total amount of GH¢256,972,988.04 for SSNIT to complete the project within two years.

The Asokore Mampong is made up of 1,053 units (91 blocks), comprising 26 shops, 336 one-bedrooms, 691 two-bedrooms, and all the blocks have been named using Adinkra symbols to reflect the culture and traditions of the Asante Kingdom.

Describing the day as ""a very good day for me"", President Akufo-Addo told the gathering that ""two important projects (Boankra Inland Port and the Asokore Mampong Affordable Housing Units) initiated by my boss, former President Kufuor, have been brought to completion for me.""

He lamented the fact that, after the exit of the NPP from office in 2009, the projects were abandoned by the Mahama government, however ""God being so good, he has made it possible for us to complete it.""

The President applauded the decision to name the Asokore-Mampong Hosuing Unit after Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, describing it as ""an excellent decision"".","The President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Thursday, 5th November 2020, commissioned three hundred and twelve (312) completed units under the Asokore-Mampong Affordable Housing Project.

Speaking during a brief stop at Kamuzu Road in Salima on Wednesday, on his way to Lilongwe from Mangochi where he spent three days of rest, Chakwera said government is aware of the network glitches facing the program and that it is working towards rectifying it.

He has since advised people in the country to remain calm as government officials work on the problem.

""I am aware that the program is being faced by network problems. As government, we are working tirelessly towards rectifying the problem to ensure that every deserving farmer who is yet to buy the inputs buys them.

""Let me ask everyone to remain calm as we continue working on the problem. Do not despair because everyone who is supposed to benefit from the program will have a chance to buy the inputs once the problem is rectified,"" said Chakwera.

He, however, warned vendors who are jeopardising the system by dubiously buying the farm inputs at the expense of poor Malawians to immediately stop or risk being jailed.

""The program targets subsistence farmers and not vendors who would like to take advantage of the program to advance their business desires.

""Let me warn you that government will not tolerate that and will make sure that once you are found you face the law,"" said Chakwera.

The President also took advantage of the stop-over to issue a strong warning to rape and defilement perpetrators of stiffer punishments if they continue to victimise young girls and women.

Speaking amid escalating reports of rape and defilement cases in the country, Chakwera said his government is concerned, hence instituted a task force to look into such cases so that girls and women who are mostly victims are protected.

""It is disturbing to learn that children and women are being defiled and raped every day. I would like to warn you that government will not tolerate this malpractice.

""Everyone found perpetrating these offences will face the law,"" he further warned.

Recently, there have been reports of increased rape and defilement cases across the country, a development that forced some quarters of the society, including the Association of Women in Media (AWOME) to march and present a petition to Parliament to demand stiffer punishments for perpetrators.","President Lazarus Chakwera on Wednesday assured Malawians of improved network for Affordable Inputs Program (AIP) currently being faced by farmers when purchasing the inputs.

After the $9 billion V.C. Summer nuclear project failure, this seemed like a welcome relief.

But in a series of missed opportunities, Dominion has appeared regularly before the S.C. Public Service Commission, resisting progress toward low-cost clean energy initiatives while asking for a rate increase during a pandemic, instead of working to fulfill its promises of lower bills and carbon emissions. Fortunately, a recent decision by the PSC has indicated the heightened level of scrutiny that utility proposals will now be subject to in South Carolina — and it’s time for Dominion to step up.

The PSC is where the rubber meets the road. It regulates rate increases, renewable investments and resource planning for utility monopolies. Energy regulators play an especially important role in our state because monopoly companies are granted the exclusive right to serve electric customers. That’s why the PSC exists — to protect against the would-be consequences of an unregulated monopoly-based market, like declines in quality, a loss of innovation and higher costs to customers.

The recent PSC ruling to reject Dominion’s long-term plan for energy generation reveals these dynamics at play. Dominion’s proposal didn’t include any new clean energy additions and didn’t consider shutting down any old, expensive coal plants. When asked by regulators about how the lack of coal retirement in the plan fits with the company’s 2050 net-zero carbon pollution commitment, Dominion stated that’s “thirty years from now” and that the company could wait until at least 2040 to start retiring coal and still meet the goal.

This is exactly why state lawmakers were smart to include PSC authority over integrated resource plans in the 2019 Energy Freedom Act. Not only did Dominion get the thumbs down from regulators, the ruling requires submission of a modified plan with a coal plant retirement analysis, stakeholder input and updated modeling. The Legislature did its job by putting teeth in the law, and the commission did its job by seeking the most prudent path forward. Perhaps Dominion also will now rise to the occasion and meet the energy planning standards that its customers deserve and the law requires.

In a separate case, Dominion has proposed to ignore the part of the Energy Freedom Act that requires consideration of the economic benefits from solar investments when deciding how to compensate customers who install rooftop solar. When regulators asked about this, Dominion stated it could not calculate those benefits because “they are extremely difficult to specifically measure.” And yet, the other billion-dollar utility in the state, Duke Energy, was able to reach an innovative agreement with solar companies and environmental organizations on this same issue, showing that “extremely difficult” doesn’t mean impossible.

In addition to standing in the way of coal plant retirements and rooftop solar customers, Dominion’s trifecta of regressive proposals includes a mid-pandemic rate increase request of over 7%, which would guarantee a 10% profit for its shareholders. This was such a tone-deaf move that Gov. Henry McMaster asked Dominion to withdraw its request for a rate increase because it would impose “unexpected and untenable burdens on many South Carolinians.”

South Carolinians deserve better, and companies such as Dominion should see this changing landscape as an opportunity, rather than an obstacle. Communities across the state are overly burdened by high electricity bills and polluting power plants. In fact, those impacted the most — communities of color and low-income communities — are also the same communities hit hardest by the pandemic and the economic crisis.

Until reforms to our energy marketplace can introduce more competition and more choice, we must rely on lawmakers and the PSC to provide checks and balances on the utilities and ensure ratepayers actually receive the affordable, reliable, clean energy that is expected and deserved.

Thankfully, it looks like this PSC is up to the task.

Natalie Olson is the campaigns director for Conservation Voters of South Carolina.","When Dominion Energy entered the scene in South Carolina a few years ago, it brought the promise of lower bills and a cleaner future for SCE&G customers.
Energy regulators play an especially important role in our state because monopoly companies are granted the exclusive right to serve electric customers.
Dominion’s proposal didn’t include any new clean energy additions and didn’t consider shutting down any old, expensive coal plants.
This is exactly why state lawmakers were smart to include PSC authority over integrated resource plans in the 2019 Energy Freedom Act.
Perhaps Dominion also will now rise to the occasion and meet the energy planning standards that its customers deserve and the law requires."

The new “Net-Zero America” research outlines five distinct technological pathways for the United States to decarbonize its entire economy. The research is the first study to quantify and map with this degree of specificity, the infrastructure that needs to be built and the investment required to run the country without emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than are removed from it each year. It’s also the first to pinpoint how jobs and health will be affected in each state at a highly granular level, sometimes down to the county.

The study’s five scenarios describe at a highly detailed, state-by-state level the scale and pace of technology and capital mobilization needed across the country, and highlight the implications for land use, incumbent energy industries, employment, and health. Initial results were released December 15, in recognition of the urgency to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the need for immediate federal, state, and local policy making efforts. Journal publications will follow in early 2021.

Over the last decade, there has been an outpouring of research from universities and pledges from cities, companies and states investigating and promulgating efforts to decarbonize energy and industrial systems. The task is to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The goal of a “net-zero emissions” economy means emitting into the atmosphere no more greenhouse gases than are permanently removed from it through technology-driven or enhanced natural processes. If successful, the strategy would stop the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is essential to limiting global warming.

Past research has probed whether net-zero is technologically possible and what it might cost to get there. But a missing piece has been detail that could inform local officials and authorities responsible for making decisions about important areas for the transition, such as siting and land use, along with information for the communities and stakeholders that shape and are affected by these decisions.

“Most studies do not provide this high geographic resolution for every state in the country, making it hard to tangibly appreciate what it will take to get to net-zero. Our research helps make a net-zero future vivid and real for people,” said Eric Larson, a lead researcher of the study and a senior research engineer at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “Unless we roll up our sleeves and really understand what we have to do by when, we won’t be able to meet our goals,” said Larson, who also leads the center’s Energy Systems Analysis Group.

The Princeton University study was led by faculty and researchers at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment and the High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI). The project leads include Larson, Jesse Jenkins, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, and Chris Greig, the Theodora D. '78 & William H. Walton III '74 Senior Research Scientist at the Andlinger Center. The research is an ongoing project of HMEI’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, a research program focused on studying and addressing climate change, and is aligned with the Andlinger Center’s Rapid Switch, a broad research initiative investigating how to accelerate decarbonization efforts globally.

The new research, which involved ten Princeton researchers and eight external collaborators, lays out five pathways by which the United States could decarbonize the entire economy in the next 30 years.

John Holdren, former science advisor to President Obama and former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, called the study remarkable and said it called attention to the areas where policy measures are most needed.

“Everybody seriously interested in the crucial question of this country’s energy-climate future—not least the new Biden-Harris administration—needs to understand the findings of this extraordinary study,” said Holdren, who is a professor in Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Because all five scenarios take the country to net-zero emissions, the researchers are neutral as to which is the “best” or most likely to be implemented. All of the pathways were found to involve annual spending on energy within the historic range of what the country spends on energy each year, about 4-6% of gross domestic product, or GDP.

“Net-zero pathways require spending a similar fraction of GDP that we spend on energy today, but we have to immediately shift investments toward new clean infrastructure instead of existing systems,” said Jenkins.

According to the research, following a “business-as-usual” pathway without concerted decarbonization efforts, the country would spend about $9.4 trillion on energy over the next decade. In all five net-zero scenarios, energy system costs are estimated to be only about 3% (or $300 billion) more for the decade, and this percentage shrinks further if oil and gas prices are higher than modeled.

The graph depicts annual U.S. spending on energy, as a percentage of GDP, historically and for each of the five net-zero scenarios going forward to 2050. The chart shows that annual energy-system costs for the net-zero trajectories are comparable to spending in recent history, but higher than for the reference scenario. The modeling assumed the same low oil and gas prices for the net-zero and reference scenarios. Because demand for oil and gas is higher in the reference case, it is plausible that oil and gas prices would also be higher. If that were the case, achieving a net-zero future may be less expensive than not pursuing decarbonization efforts.

“We now have a good body of evidence that shows, ‘yes, it’s affordable.’ We can do it,” said Larson. ""And, of course, there are significant costs of not doing anything. Climate science has shown that unchecked warming will harm communities here in America and all over the world from changes in disease pattern to the displacement of millions of people from sea level rise and flooding from more intense storms.”

The scenarios that the new research details include a “high electrification” or E+ scenario, which involves aggressively electrifying buildings and transportation, so that 100% of cars are electric by 2050. The “less high electrification” or E- scenario, electrifies at a slower rate and uses more liquid and gaseous fuels for longer. Another scenario, noted as E- B+, allows much more biomass to be used in the energy system, which, unlike the other four scenarios, would require converting some land currently used for food agriculture to grow energy crops. The E+ RE+ pathway is an ""all-renewables"" scenario and also is the most technologically restrictive. It assumes no new nuclear plants would be built, disallows below-ground storage of carbon dioxide, and eliminates all fossil fuel use by 2050. It relies instead on massive and rapid deployment of wind and solar and greater production of hydrogen to meet carbon goals. The E+ RE- scenario, by comparison, relies on “limited renewables,” constraining the annual construction of wind turbines and solar power plants to be no faster than the fastest rates achieved by the country in the past, but removes other restrictions. This scenario depends more heavily on the expansion of power plants with carbon capture and nuclear power.

The chart summarizes the key characteristics of each of the net-zero trajectories that the new research presents, compared against the reference case, a business-as-usual scenario with no concerted decarbonization effort. Each of the new pathways provides a way to decarbonize the entire U.S. economy by midcentury, but use different technologies to get there.

“Since getting to net-zero looks affordable, the next key question is if we are going to do this, how do we want to do it? Everyone will benefit from limiting climate change, but the different scenarios do have uneven effects as they play out. Who benefits more, and who pays more? Can we do it equitably, and so that enough people see clear benefits that there is an enduring coalition of support?” said Jenkins.

He said those questions are very different from the ones that energy and climate researchers typically address, which is why Net-Zero America research required a large team with diverse disciplinary backgrounds and skills to carry out the investigation. In all five scenarios, the researchers found major health and economic benefits across the country. On each pathway, by 2030 coal is no longer used for power generation, and there is an associated reduction in emissions of nitrogen-oxides, sulfur-oxides and fine particulate matter from power plants. Reducing exposure to fine particulate matter avoids 100,000 premature deaths, which is equivalent to nearly $1 trillion in air pollution benefits, by midcentury compared to a “business-as-usual” pathway.

The actions to achieve net-zero emissions create approximately 500,000 to 1 million new energy jobs across the country in the 2020s alone, with net job increases in nearly every state. The scenarios that more heavily rely on wind and solar see more energy jobs created. In nearly all states, job losses in extractive fossil industries are more than offset by an increase in construction and manufacturing in the clean energy sector. Significant job dislocations and transitions will occur in some states where the economy relies heavily on coal and oil, such as West Virginia and Louisiana. The researchers said the granular findings are useful in identifying where and when dislocation will occur and can inform public policy strategies to effectively manage these transitions.

The map depicts the city of St. Louis, Missouri, and surroundings in 2050 under the E+ or high electrification scenario. It shows where and how much renewable energy could be deployed at least cost, subject to siting restrictions assumed in the modeling, in order to meet net-zero goals. The map is one example of the specificity that the new research provides. View the full report for maps of other cities across the United States.

“These findings can inform critical policies that can help manage the effects of the transition and create a more just clean energy economy and society,” said Erin Mayfield, a postdoctoral researcher at HMEI who led the employment and air pollution analysis in the study.

In all net-zero scenarios, the required scale of investments and the pace of building new infrastructure demand that rapid change starts immediately, the researchers said.

“We have all the technologies we need to get started. We need to be deploying them much more rapidly than we are today, and we also need to be investing to create real options for those less mature technologies that will be needed for the longer term,” said Greig.

Wind and solar power, along with the electrification of buildings and cars, must grow rapidly this decade for the nation to be on a net-zero trajectory. The researchers said the 2020s must also be used to continue to develop technologies, such as those that capture carbon at natural gas or cement plants or those that split water to produce hydrogen, so that they are affordable to deploy at scale in the 2030s. But for the next several years, the researchers said most of the big investment revolves around clean electricity and electrification and is similar across all of the scenarios.

According to the research, the United States will need to expand its electricity transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and may need to triple it by 2050. Electrifying buildings, primarily by adding heat pumps for water and space heating, and electrifying transportation is another step that must be accelerated in the 2020s to set the stage for any of the pathways.

“The current power grid took 150 years to build. Now, to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, we have to build that amount of transmission again in the next 15 years and then build that much more again in the 15 years after that. It's a huge amount of change,” said Jenkins.

A critical issue for driving this clean-energy agenda is where new solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing facilities are built, and where the solar and wind farms themselves are sited, along with biofuel production plants. The research provides city and regional maps that show where it is least costly to build these facilities and where they integrate into the energy system most efficiently. But this does not account for the social and human aspects of where to construct new infrastructure.

“Individuals and communities across the country are going be affected by net-zero transitions in different ways. All Americans will be crucial partners in this transition, and we must be sensitive to the needs and values of communities when planning and implementing the very significant infrastructure and other developments needed to get to net-zero,” said Greig.

The researchers said they hope that the report will, by providing a variety of futures, provide confidence that the United States has several genuine pathways for getting to net-zero emissions, and help guide investment and policy priorities over the next few years. They said the research offers insights on how to make decisions over the near term that are consistent with eliminating net-carbon emissions 30 years from now.

“None of the Princeton scenarios will prove to be ‘right,’ but together they provide a compelling picture of possible paths forward,” said Holdren.

""The motivation is to provide granular guidance for decision-makers as to what it would take to make those net-zero pledges a reality, with a focus on the actions we need to take today that will have lasting impacts long after the CEO is retired or the policymaker is out of office,” said Jenkins.

This brief timeline would rely on fast-paced technological development, widespread infrastructure transformations, and pervasive societal change in order to stave off the impending threats of climate change.

The teams behind the study — led by the co-principal investigators Chris Greig, Eric Larson, and Jesse Jenkins of the Andlinger Center — determined that all five proposed net-zero emissions pathways involve expenditures that remain within the standard bounds of historical annual energy GDP costs, or about 4–6 percent of the nation’s GDP.

The “Net-Zero America Project” was conducted over the span of two years and focuses on the granular elements of five proposed decarbonization plans and their implications on employment, land use, existing energy industries, and human health, among other factors.

It envisions achievable solutions to the existential threats posed by climate change by ensuring that the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere does not surpass the amount permanently removed using different technologies and other atmospheric removal processes, otherwise known as “net-zero emissions.”

The study’s findings arrive at a time when the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral economy and 100 percent clean energy infrastructure by 2050 has been endorsed by President-elect Joe Biden as part of his envisioned “Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.”

Previous studies exclusively focused on the feasibility of net-zero emissions goals as well as the potential expenditures of pursuing such plans; the University study expands beyond this scope to examine the economic ramifications that implementing any one of the five outlined net-zero emissions reductions plans could yield on a state-by-state basis and even down to certain county levels.

In a video describing the premise of the Net-Zero America Project, Jenkins, professor in the Department of of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Andlinger Center, acknowledged the challenges involved in committing to any of the plans examined in the study.

“Getting to net-zero requires rebuilding and retooling our entire national energy infrastructure. That’s going to be a major national undertaking. It’s a substantial change across multiple sectors of the economy requiring unprecedented rates of deployment of significant scale and complexity,” he said.

The study used many calculations and rigorous computer modeling techniques in an unparalleled effort to closely examine the smaller-scale human impacts of advancing toward a net-zero emissions economy. The 345-page report features intensive data analyses and granular examinations of the economic and industry-wide implications if the federal government were to pursue any of the several technological pathways explored.

According to the study’s findings, adherence to a “business-as-usual” plan in which fossil fuel usage is not phased out and the goal of net-zero emissions is not pursued will cost around $9.4 trillion over the next decade. In contrast, the study projected that each of the five drafted emissions-phasing proposals would require only a 3 percent increase in annual energy expenditures — about $300 billion — throughout the decade, minuscule increases relative to historical energy spending trends.

Of the five proposed plans, the “100 percent renewable” scenario, also known as the E+ RE+ pathway, demands the highest rate of technological advancement in order to fulfill the net-zero emissions goal by 2050. This pathway would require the rampant electrification of infrastructure and transportation, such that 100 percent of vehicles would run electrically by 2050.

Furthermore, it would be necessary to ramp up the production of wind turbines, solar plants, and currently primitive hydrogen-powered technology. This plan would prohibit carbon dioxide storage and the construction of new nuclear plants and would require phasing out fossil fuels within the next three decades.

The E+ RE- plan, or “renewable constrained” scenario, would similarly necessitate intensive electrification action, but would impose limits on the development of new solar and wind plants while incentivizing the capture of greater quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This plan, along with the other three plans, would not require that fossil fuels use be eradicated within three decades, as the E+ RE+ scenario does.

The E- B+ (“high biomass”) scenario would require slightly less electrification of infrastructure and transportation but would permit the construction of new nuclear, wind, and solar power plants. This plan would additionally permit significantly more biomass to be used such that land masses normally reserved for agricultural purposes would be converted to accommodate the cultivation of energy crops.

The E+ (“high electrification”) and E- (“less high electrification”) pathways are virtually indistinguishable aside from one key difference: The former would necessitate considerable electrification of infrastructure, whereas the latter would not mandate as much electrification.

Regardless of the different mechanisms by which each plan would alter current elements of the contemporary economic and energy landscape, they all serve as viable candidates for ensuring that the United States moves toward a net-zero emissions future.

One of the study’s most striking findings includes the ability of each plan to preclude approximately 100,000 premature particulate matter-related deaths by mitigating exposure to fine particulate matter, which would not only grant substantial health benefits but would also translate to immense economic benefits.

The study also closely examined the economic impacts of the proposed plans on a state level and determined that every state would experience net job increases in the energy industry under each plan, with nearly 500,000 to 1 million new jobs materializing within the span of this decade alone.

Projected job losses due to phasing out of coal and oil plants under some of the plans would be more than compensated for by the predicted surge in clean energy jobs that would arise; however, states with economies that currently revolve around heavy production of fossil fuels, such as coal-laden Wyoming and West Virginia, could initially suffer economic losses if one of the five plans is advanced.

“These findings can inform critical policies that can help manage the effects of the transition and create a more just clean energy economy and society,” said Erin Mayfield, a postdoctoral researcher at HMEI who contributed to the research, in the University press release.

The Net-Zero America Project finds that supporting the use of renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar plants leads to significant progress in approaching the net-zero emissions goal. The study additionally emphasizes the importance of encouraging the further development and refinement of carbon-capturing technologies and hydrogen power plants.

The study’s researchers believe that investment and policy-motivated efforts can expedite the development of crucial innovations such as carbon capture, biofuel energy cultivation, and hydrogen power plants in the coming decades in order to bring the nation closer to satisfying the net-zero emissions goal.

“We now have a good body of evidence that shows, ‘Yes, it’s affordable.’ We can do it,” said Larson in the University press release. “And, of course, there are significant costs of not doing anything. Climate science has shown that unchecked warming will harm communities here in America and all over the world from changes in disease pattern to the displacement of millions of people from sea level rise and flooding from more intense storms.”

Joshua Drossman ’22, an undergraduate student concentrating in operations research and financial engineering, assisted with certain elements of the “Net-Zero America Project.” He agreed with Larson, noting that all of the proposed pathways present extensively studied, viable opportunities to reach a net-zero emissions economy in the United States as soon as possible.

“[The study] really sets the stage for policy planning and emphasizes where we need to focus our time and money to meet that goal. Most importantly, we have shown that it is not only feasible, but affordable,” Drossman wrote.

“That being said, I do believe some pathways will be more challenging than others to implement and closely follow in practice. The high electrification E+ scenario, for instance, requires renewable technology build-out that is pretty ambitious compared to historical rates. Whatever the case, I agree with the team: There is no ‘best’ pathway. Net-zero is net-zero,” he continued.

WEST WARWICK — The new corporate owner of the Echo Valley Apartments could have taken the easier road when it decided to invest in solar power at the affordable-housing complex by limiting the output to only what the tenants would use.

It would have probably meant a simpler regulatory process before state and local authorities, and a shorter project timeline.

But then the company wouldn’t have maximized all the rooftop space at the low-slung apartment buildings situated near the Pawtuxet River, or have been able to generate as much renewable energy as possible there.

“It would have been a waste of a beautiful roof,” quipped Michael Gilbert, director of energy and sustainability for Fairstead, a New York company that owns and rehabs affordable housing nationwide.

So the firm designed a 497-kilowatt system that could supply power to any of the 100 or so families at Echo Valley that wanted it and could send out the remainder to residents of the surrounding community who signed on.

In doing so, Fairstead says, the array at Echo Valley, which was completed earlier this fall, became the first “community solar” project located at an affordable-housing complex in Rhode Island. (The company says it checked the claim with the Public Utilities Commission. The commission says it’s possible, even likely, that the claim is true, while the state Office of Energy Resources also says it’s possible.)

It would be a notable achievement in several respects. For one, there are only a handful of solar projects that serve low- and mixed-income housing developments in the state. Despite changes in state law in recent years to encourage more of the projects, there are still impediments, including an older statute that restricts how electricity is metered.

Community solar is also a relatively new thing in Rhode Island. The first such project went into operation last year, and 17 more have either been built or are in development, according to the state energy office. Community projects fall into a specific class of solar in which power is shared by many smaller users, usually individual homes, rather than being hogged by one large user, like a hospital, university or municipality.

The projects are aimed at democratizing solar by offering clean energy to homeowners who don’t have suitable roofs for photovoltaic panels, or renters who can’t install them. They’re also more cost-effective than rooftop systems on single homes because of economies of scale.

And due to tax credits and other incentives, customers who sign on are able to buy power at a price lower than what they would pay through their utility and generally see savings of 8% to 12% on their electric bills.

The Echo Valley solar array also stands out because of its location in a densely developed town with a large share of low- and moderate-income households. Environmental-justice advocates have long complained that urban and minority communities are underserved by renewable energy. It’s a national problem that’s also true in Rhode Island, where the bulk of solar and wind projects are located in rural areas, where development costs are lower.

Will Blodgett, a founding partner of Fairstead, is well aware of the energy inequities that exist in low-income communities. He says it’s a primary reason his company works to make its units as energy efficient as possible through weatherization and by investing in Energy Star-rated appliances and new heating and air conditioning systems. The company has reduced the carbon footprint of each of its newly acquired apartments by 30% on average, he says.

Over the last six years, the company has rehabbed some 16,000 apartments in 14 states, but the Echo Valley project is its first foray into community solar.

“It’s all about creating positive social and environmental change in the lives of our residents,” Blodgett said.

Gilbert also frames the company’s project within a larger debate taking place in Rhode Island and other states about building solar in woodlands, farm fields and other undeveloped areas that have value as open space versus commercial and industrial areas that are already disturbed.

There’s a growing movement to direct solar away from green spaces through grants and other incentives — even as the Raimondo administration works toward a goal of meeting all of Rhode Island’s electric needs through solar, wind and other renewable sources by 2030.

The Echo Valley project isn’t so big when compared to the rural “solar farms” in places like Hopkinton or Cranston that can be 20 or 40 times as large, but it’s a size that’s much more achievable in urban areas.

“Those are systems you’re probably going to see more of,” said Chris Kearns, policy and legislative liaison for the state energy office.

What was done at the Echo Valley complex can serve as an example for other affordable housing developments.

""What I think is helpful to remember is that the technology and law are always evolving and now that the first one has been done in [Rhode Island] there is an opportunity to understand what barriers exist and how those barriers should be addressed,"" said Christine Hunsinger, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island Housing.

It's something Blodgett and his firm are hoping for.

“We did this to maximize impact,” he said.","'Community' solar project built on affordable housing complex in West WarwickWEST WARWICK — The new corporate owner of the Echo Valley Apartments could have taken the easier road when it decided to invest in solar power at the affordable-housing complex by limiting the output to only what the tenants would use.

A regional planning agency in the Twin Cities is offering to help suburban rental property owners add solar panels to their buildings in exchange for setting aside additional apartments for low-income renters.

The Metropolitan Council’s Solar-for-Vouchers pilot program is recruiting building owners who are interested in solar and willing to increase the number of units eligible for Section 8 vouchers.

“We’re looking to be able to find that sweet spot of someone who’s interested in solar and open to having more vouchers,” Peter Lindstrom, a former suburban mayor who represents several northern suburbs on the Metropolitan Council.

Those that meet the requirements will gain access to group purchasing and a streamlined permitting process estimated to shave 5% to 15% from the cost of a solar installation.

It’s an innovative and potentially first-of-its-kind approach aimed at using the growing financial appeal of solar to entice property owners to invest in desperately needed affordable housing.

The Twin Cities is one of the nation’s tightest housing markets for low-income renters. Despite enormous growth in multifamily housing in the region, few of the thousands of apartments recently built are affordable for low- and moderate-income residents. Many of the region’s Section 8 programs, which use money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help residents pay their rent, remain closed to new applicants as COVID-19 and the lack of affordable housing spiked demand.

Under the federally funded Section 8 program, applicants often wait years for vouchers that reduce the cost of rent to about 30% of their monthly household income. Even after winning that lottery, though, many still struggle to find an apartment where the property owner will accept the vouchers. In 2019, only 56% of Section 8 participants could find an apartment to rent after waiting on average 22 months just to get a voucher.

The Solar-for-Vouchers Program brings together the Met Council’s expertise in housing and solar. As the Twin Cities’ regional government and metropolitan planning agency, the organization operates Minnesota’s largest Section 8 housing program and assists with communities with affordable housing grants. As the operator of wastewater facilities and Metro Transit, the regional rail and bus system, the council has added solar projects at several sites, including plants and parking garages. The council also led a collaboration of government agencies in an initiative to buy community solar garden subscriptions in a cooperative arrangement similar to Solar-for-Vouchers.

Regional planner and solar advisor Cameran Bailey and Met Council senior researcher Baris Gumus-Dawes developed the program. Bailey said Solar-for-Vouchers remains unique in its approach toward promoting solar on multifamily housing, though other cities and regions have initiatives to help low-income residents reduce utility bills through clean energy.

Over the past couple of months, Bailey has held several online educational workshops that attracted more than 100 attendees. “There’s been a good amount of interest in the program so far, from building owners to officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul who want to be part of this,” he said.

However, he concedes that the program faces a challenging market and a series of restrictions limiting participation. Building owners who want to participate must add Section 8 units, not rely on those they already rent. Buildings can be no taller than five stories and have no fewer than five apartments. Apartment owners also need to rent roughly 10% of their units as Section 8.

Multifamily building owners with five to 20 units, for example, must add two Section 8 units; if they have 21 to 40 apartments, they need to lease at least four. Buildings with more apartments have to add more Section 8 units. Bailey said that many residents will not directly benefit from having solar projects on their buildings because they pay for electricity separately from rent.

The carrot of helping install solar goes to property owners who will return the favor by leasing to Section 8 voucher holders. If everything goes according to plan, building owners will use the money earned by solar to maintain affordable units for Section 8 renters and other tenants.

For the program to work, property owners will need to recognize the advantage of reducing electricity consumption costs in exterior lighting and in common areas, such as hallways, entries, and community rooms. “We want to reduce the landlords’ operating costs while stabilizing tenant costs over time,” Bailey said. “When operating costs are lower, more Section 8 voucher holders can get placed and more low-income people can afford to rent over a longer period — five years or more.”

Building owners should see other reasons to install solar to serve Section 8 residents. Solar tax credits have declined but still bring down the cost by more than 20%. Because the program requires property owners to be Xcel Energy customers, property owners can participate in the utility’s Solar Rewards program and receive additional financial incentives, he said.

Clean Energy Resource Teams will help the Met Council and building owners pre-qualify installers, negotiate contracts, navigate financing, and ensure the viability of solar on rooftops. CERTS works with government organizations on efficiency and clean energy investments.

Lindstrom, of the Met Council, also serves as manager of public sector and community engagement for CERTS. He remains optimistic that the Solar-for-Vouchers program will work for both property owners and installers, the latter benefitting by having a pre-qualified pool of customers ready for projects, though it may take some time to find the right matches.

“I think we have our work cut out for us,” Lindstrom said.

Michelle Ferreira owns a seven-unit apartment building constructed in 1958 in a Minneapolis suburb and attended the recent workshop. Ferrara declined to enroll in the program because she had no apartments available for Section 8. She also decided to install solar on her own after discovering a company with affordable solar financing.

“I really like [the Solar-for-Vouchers] program and I think landlords should definitely look at it,” Ferreira said. “What I learned on my own is that the solar will basically pay for itself and then some.”

Michael Rollert, senior real estate director for Bethesda Lutheran Communities, studied the idea of adding solar to a recently opened 52-unit senior development in suburban Victoria that included apartments for people with disabilities. But he concluded that Solar-for-Vouchers didn’t make sense for its current project.

Bailey understands that the program may have limited appeal until it becomes more established in the local housing market. The Met Council hopes the program can attract 10 to 15 apartment buildings to benefit 75 to 150 voucher holders. A successful Solar-for-Vouchers Program will show people that the government can improve lives: “I want people to know that government works and can be for the public good,” Bailey said.

Building owners have until Jan. 17 to apply.","It’s an innovative and potentially first-of-its-kind approach aimed at using the growing financial appeal of solar to entice property owners to invest in desperately needed affordable housing.
The Solar-for-Vouchers Program brings together the Met Council’s expertise in housing and solar.
As the Twin Cities’ regional government and metropolitan planning agency, the organization operates Minnesota’s largest Section 8 housing program and assists with communities with affordable housing grants.
Because the program requires property owners to be Xcel Energy customers, property owners can participate in the utility’s Solar Rewards program and receive additional financial incentives, he said.
“I really like [the Solar-for-Vouchers] program and I think landlords should definitely look at it,” Ferreira said."
383,https://www.intelligentliving.co/floating-nuclear-power-plants,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Intelligent Living,Floating Nuclear Power Plants Are An Affordable And Clean Alternative To Fossil Fuels,"Danish startup Seaborg Technologies says it can make affordable nuclear electricity a viable alternative to fossil fuels. It says its floating barges fitted with advanced nuclear reactors could provide electricity across the developing world as soon as 2025.

This news follows the success of the world’s first floating nuclear power plant (the Akademik Lomonosov) to go online in 40 years. It was built in a St Petersburg shipyard in Russia, then towed to and docked at Pevek, Chukotka, in the country’s remote Far East in December 2019.

Rosatom, the project’s developer, and Russia’s state nuclear corporation said:

These small nuclear reactors can operate non-stop without the need for refueling for three to five years, thereby considerably reducing the cost of electricity generation. While variable renewable energy installations such as wind and solar for such areas require expensive and polluting diesel back-up or costly energy storage, small nuclear power plants ensure uninterrupted electricity supply even for energy-intensive users. The reactors have the potential to work particularly well in regions with extended coastlines, power supply shortages, and limited access to electrical grids, and the plant can be delivered to any point along a coast and connected to existing electrical grids.

Seaborg Technologies’ seaborne “mini-nukes” are designed for regions that lack the energy grid infrastructure to develop utility-scale renewable energy projects. The ships are fitted with at least one small nuclear reactor that generates electricity to be transmitted to the mainland, providing an alternative to using gas, coal, or diesel plants.

Kirsty Gogan, head of the London-based NGO Energy for Humanity, said:

For hard-to-reach regions, with a climate that is simultaneously too harsh to support the use of renewable energies and too fragile to continue its heavy dependence on fossil fuels, small nuclear, including floating plants, is the only answer.

Seaborg’s 100-megawatt compact molten salt reactor takes two years to build. The electricity it would generate is cheaper than coal-fired power. The barges would be built in South Korean shipyards and towed to coastlines where they could remain anchored for up to 24 years.

The company hopes to be taking orders by 2022. It has raised around €20m (£18.3m) from private investors so far and received the first of four necessary regulatory approvals from the American Bureau of Shipping.

Troels Schönfeldt, Seaborg’s chief executive, said:

The scale of the developing world’s energy demand growth is mind-boggling. If we can’t find an energy solution for these countries, they will turn to fossil fuels, and we surely won’t meet our climate targets.

According to the International Energy Agency, the growing global population and rising levels of affluence are accelerating the demand for electricity to the point that it’s on course to outpace the rise of renewable energy and increase dependence on fossil fuels. Floating nuclear power plants could be the “turn-key solution” necessary for fast-growing developing economies to power their industries, produce clean-burning hydrogen, and purify drinking water.

For decades nuclear energy has been used onboard seaborne vessels to power “icebreaker” tankers and submarines, but some remain skeptical. Chris Gadomski, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance nuclear analyst, said:

“The concept of a floating nuclear power plant has been around for a long time and makes a lot of sense. But there are concerns. There was inherent risk involved with nuclear reactor technologies and floating power plants, so combining the two could raise serious questions for investors and governments. In places like the Philippines and Indonesia, it makes a lot of sense. But it wasn’t so long ago that the Philippines was the site of a major tsunami, and I don’t know how you would hedge against a risk like that.

Others are entirely against the idea. Greenpeace activist Jan Haverkamp said:

Floating reactors are a recipe for disaster, including all of the flaws and risks of larger land-based nuclear power stations. On top of that, they face additional risks from the unpredictability of operation in coastal areas and transport – particularly in a loaded state – over the high seas. Think storms, think tsunamis.

However, Schönfeldt says Seaborg’s advanced reactor is designed to be safe in a worst-case scenario accident. It has a built-in system that causes radioactive material to turn solid outside of the reactor core so it can’t disperse into the sea or air as a gas or liquid.","Danish startup Seaborg Technologies says it can make affordable nuclear electricity a viable alternative to fossil fuels.

Jaideep Mukherji and Bharath Jairaj

India’s energy access challenges have come down significantly in the last two decades, due to the concerted efforts by national and state governments. Though significant progress has been seen on the electrification of willing households, gaps still exist. Access to energy runs along the fault lines of poverty and inequality: those who are unable to pay for electricity rely on less optimum fuels such as traditional biomass or kerosene lamps. A recent study by Smart Power India (SPI) titled ‘Electricity Access in India: Benchmarking Distribution Utilities’ points out that lack of adequate electricity infrastructure is a major reason why a larger number of electricity customers have not been able to connect to the national grid. As a result, institutional customers such as hospitals, farms, schools, and skilling centres are forced to invest in expensive and polluting diesel generators to enjoy uninterrupted power supply, because when available, the grid is also unreliable.

Progress on electrification rates masks the energy poverty that continues to constrain the delivery of basic services as well as farm and non-farm productivity. Recent work by World Resources Institute India (WRI India) reiterates that without a reliable source of electricity, health care facilities struggle to deliver vital services to communities, and those providing agricultural and non-farm enterprise support services are held back all along the value chain. More than 30,000 health centres across rural India, and scores of schools, community centres, and anganwadis are not yet connected to the grid. A vast majority of them are in a few states of India. Without basic access, outcomes in the health, education and livelihoods sectors will remain difficult.

While there have been isolated successes in linking energy with development goals, a systemic approach has proved elusive. As COVID-19 threatens the well-being of people and economies across the world, the 2030 goals on health, hunger, and poverty alleviation have never been more urgent. Building the resilience of communities, particularly in Indian states with lower socio-economic development, is paramount so that they can stay healthy and economically secure. Access to reliable electricity will be critical in spurring economic activities in rural India.

A key success story in recent times is that of the Customer Voucher Scheme (CVS) that SPI, a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Foundation, launched during the lockdown to provide financial relief to mini-grid customers and, in turn, bolster the liquidity of mini-grid companies. The scheme provided three months of subsidy to 5,000 customers in 92 villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. As a result, electricity revenue for mini-grid developers recovered to pre-Covid levels, and tariff collection efficiency bounced back to 100%. The scheme also ensured that mini-grids have access to the uninterrupted electricity supply. Initiatives such as this can be adopted on a larger scale to address economic barriers and provide reliable electricity to customers in underserved communities in India and around the globe.

How can India provide reliable and affordable electricity to all?

It is important to place access to reliable and affordable electricity in the front and centre of policy and regulatory efforts. Placing consumers at the centre of the next stage of reforms in the sector will require a more nuanced understanding of consumer priorities including capacity, sustainability, quality, and customer service. And energy policy, sector regulation, operations, infrastructure, and governance will need to be revamped to align with this approach. Done right, India will be able to achieve SDG7 of providing affordable and clean energy to all, with no one left behind. As the SPI study reveals, a customer-centric approach wherein the focus is on customer satisfaction will help DISCOMs improve their financial health and overall energy delivery performance.

While the effort of connecting millions of people to the grid is impressive, we need to refocus efforts to ensure the provision of electricity that matches with the electricity demand. And as discussed, this must go beyond households, to meet the needs of the health, education and livelihoods sectors that operate across rural and remote parts of the country.

This will need revamping new electricity connection processes to enable a quick, transparent, and easy connection. Equally important is the ability to harness the wide variety of Decentralized Renewable Energy (DRE) solutions that can help utilities in meeting unmet and under-met demand. One way to bring the DRE solutions in is by exploring a franchisee relationship between utilities and DRE entities. Service delivery should be grid-agnostic, to overcome the limitations of high grid extension costs, and challenges with extending the grid to remote areas. In addition to ensuring last mile connectivity, and better reliability, this effort will enable more socio-economic and rural development outcomes, while also helping build local capacity and create jobs.

A simple, yet effective way to implement this would be the establishment of a ready fund that can be used to fast-track connections by providing last-mile connectivity, standardizing service connection costs, reviewing pending or previously rejected applications, and compensating DRE companies for any gap in revenue. Equally important is the need to review that the right consumer tariffs are being charged to the right customers, and the subsidies are being rightly targeted.

Increased customer awareness will require public outreach campaigns about subsidies for electricity, direct benefit transfer, and other benefits to consumers. Awareness needs to be backed by the guarantee of consumer rights – for e.g., on supply quality standards, efficiency benchmarks, ease of payment of bills, compensation for failure to adhere to the standards, and other issues that are part of the draft Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020.

Focusing on consumers and their demand will also help improve India’s per capita electricity consumption. Currently, some parts of the country consume in excess, and other parts barely consume electricity. We need to look at more energy efficiency, including building efficiency, to reduce the wasteful consumption of energy, while at the same time, increasing household and institutional energy consumption in rural and remote parts of the country. The added benefit of including DRE in the service delivery is that grid inefficiency and losses can be avoided since many DRE technologies allow for energy to be consumed close to the point of generation.

Interview Transcript

Ryan Warner: In a state that went big for Joe Biden, Republican and Trump fan Lauren Boebert scored a comfortable victory — to represent Grand Junction and Pueblo and Alamosa in Congress. Soon, she'll be sworn in. The restaurateur, gun rights activist, and avid Twitter user, was in Washington for freshman orientation. She's back home in the 3rd district now, which is where we reached her to talk energy, healthcare, vaccines and unity.

Well, Congresswoman-elect, thank you for being with us.

Representative-elect Lauren Boebert: Thank you so much for having me today, Ryan.

RW: I'd love to just jump into some policy. You campaigned on a pro-energy platform. You described it as an all-of-the-above strategy, that includes everything from drilling to nuclear energy. What kind of activity would you like to see in Colorado to produce nuclear energy?

LB: There certainly is uranium that we could work to extract, and I would love to be a part of that. In fact, I have been having conversations with Alex Epstein, and if you don't know who he is, he wrote the book, “The Moral Case For Fossil Fuels,” and nuclear is something that he discusses a lot.

This is something that's always frustrated me when we hear about reducing CO2 emissions or being carbonless by 2050. It's just very disingenuous to me, because there's no opportunity to explore using uranium to create nuclear energy, which we know is the cleanest form of energy. It's even hard to get something as simple as hydro electricity classified as a renewable.

RW: You see nuclear then as a way to reduce carbon and fight climate change. Do I hear you right?

LB: Absolutely, a way to reduce carbon emissions. Yes.

RW: You call it the safest form of energy. I think some would push back and say, that's maybe solar or wind. What do you base that on?

LB: Well, it's certainly the cleanest form of energy, uranium is. We've come a long way in the production and just learning how to work with uranium and make sure that it is safe. The problem with wind and solar is this is intermittent energy, and so it's really an unreliable energy source, because you have to have the wind blowing. You have to have the sun shining.

We have rare earth minerals right here in America. But because of the regulations that are put on, when it comes to mining these rare earth minerals, it's very difficult to get the permits approved and move forward with that here in the United States. Then our energy is often outsourced to China and Africa, and my biggest problem with that, other than being subject to China for our energy needs, is that child and slave labor is often used there.

That alone should make us reconsider where we are outsourcing our energy needs to. President Trump and his administration have made America energy independent, and I want to continue that and I want to pursue energy dominance. We have natural gas here. We have our coal industry, but our natural gas is really something that I like to focus on.

RW: Speaking of, you support a proposed project called Jordan Cove to build a port in —

LB: Yes, I do.

RW: ... in Oregon,and an associated pipeline, which would get liquified natural gas to overseas markets. What benefit do you see that bringing your district?

LB: So many. First of all, it's an instant economic boost here in my district, exporting our LNG globally, selling our liquified natural gas to these countries who are currently dependent on Communist dictators. It not only creates international markets, but it does the right thing of liberating these countries. Here in the district, it creates these high paying jobs, and my favorite part about a good paying job here in the district is that it keeps families together.

My husband works in the natural gas industry. He drills for natural gas. He has for 17 years, and I know that when our industry's bad here, he usually goes somewhere else to work. That is a very hard strain on the family, and there are many families that haven't recovered from that. Dad had to go to another state. Dad had to go to another country to drill and provide for his family to meet those needs that they had set their standards of living to.

It's really hard to hear the families that don't come back together after that. Not only do we have just those high-paying jobs for families, but the small businesses that are impacted from that, that is very important to me. I know in my restaurant, things are going really well when there are chunks of mud that I have to clean up off of my floor, because that means the guys are coming in after a long, hard day's work in the field and spending their money in my establishment.

If you don't mind, I'd like to just touch on Pueblo really quick. I spent a lot of time in Pueblo.

RW: This is a city, I'll say, that it has committed itself to renewable energy. It's the seat of Vestas, a huge wind power firm.

LB: Yes, absolutely, and we certainly want to support them in all of the above energy needs. We just don't want government choosing the winners and losers with their subsidies and creating a false market. We want free markets. We want the markets to be able to decide.

RW: Would you eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels then, because they too are subsidized?

LB: Yes, I am not for subsidies at all. We are a country of capitalism, and we need to have free markets deciding. When you have government getting involved and creating false markets, that's when you pervert the research and development process. I am not for subsidies whatsoever for our energy industry.

RW: Republican Congressman-elect Lauren Boebert is our guest who, come January, will represent the Third Congressional District in Colorado.

RW: I do want to move on to some healthcare issues. Last month, the U.S.Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a lawsuit that would effectively kill the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. You've said you support keeping coverage for preexisting conditions. What about the rest of the ACA? Do you support doing away with that?

LB: I've never really made a stance, taken a stance, on keeping or eliminating ACA. I think that we need to have a more free-market based solution and create competition in the marketplace. Maybe there's something that comes up that has an option where American citizens get to choose a more free healthcare solution, where patient and doctor relationships are brought together, where there's transparency in prices, and there's a competition in the pricing. That they just kind of step away from the ACA and it dissolves on its own because it's not popular or needed and people have another option.

RW: In other words, moving beyond the ACA is not something you object to.

LB: We need better for the American people. Right now when you talk to Democrats, they want to expand it and ultimately move towards universal healthcare. I think that Republicans need to start presenting ideas that are more free market based and give ability to people to be in control of their own healthcare decisions rather than having more government intervention. I don't think that we need to look to government to be our savior here.

RW: This is a theme for you. I want to read from a recent tweet that you sent, ""Stop waiting"" —

LB: Uh-oh.

RW: Uh-oh?

LB: I say a lot.

RW: You are active on Twitter and you said in the past few days, ""Stop waiting for the government to save you. In America, we save ourselves."" I wonder if you would put that philosophy into the context of COVID-19. A lot of struggling businesses right now that need government help, a lot of people who need rental assistance, etc. What does it mean to say to someone during a global pandemic, ""Stop waiting for the government to save you. In America, we save ourselves.""?

LB: Well, why do they need saving right now? Because government stepped in and thought that they knew best on how to run our lives. It's these blue states, where governors have pushed forward their executive orders and have shut down their economies, and now they're expecting handouts from the federal government.

I think the best stimulus package is to reopen America. We need to get back open for business. You cannot keep shutting people down. People are desperate. I get dozens of emails every single day of people wanting to get to work. They want to open their businesses. They are losing everything because government said we know best, shut down your restaurant, shut down your business.

RW: Give me an example of a recent email. Can you think of an example that stands out?

LB: There's a lot of emails that just say, ""I'm getting ready to lose everything."" I had a woman stop me in the Grand Junction airport,and she just started crying. She said, ""We cannot go on living like this."" She talked about friends that she knows that they're losing their businesses. People have invested their lives into their business and now government is saying,”you can't operate.”

Now, we have certain unalienable rights here in America and these rights don't come from government. They didn't come from some politician. These are endowed by our creator. These are our God-given rights. These are our natural rights, if you will. We, the governed, give consent to be governed, and there's some things that we aren't consenting to anymore.

That's why you see so many business owners taking a stand and refusing to shut down their doors, because they want to make payroll. That's why I opened my restaurant back in May. I needed to make payroll.

RW: We're talking about a Shooters Grill in Rifle. Now there are rights, and then I think you'd hear from some that there are responsibilities that we have to one another. Congresswoman- elect, I speak to a lot of healthcare professionals, frontline nurses and doctors, who are exhausted, who can't imagine opening the economy even more and seeing the virus spread to an even greater degree.

We know that hospital capacity is stressed, so it's one thing to call for businesses to be open. But what would that mean for the healthcare system on the Western Slope, for instance, or in Pueblo, if the virus has its way with us?

LB: First of all, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who is on the front lines, taking care of this. These —

RW: I don't know if they're going to believe the gratitude when they hear that you want to reopen the economy.

LB: Okay, well, I am grateful for them, and they've definitely signed up for an industry where this is a possibility. They have signed up to be on the front lines, and that's why we call them heroes, but our suicide rates are high. Our depression rates are high. Our children are home. We cannot go on living like this under these shutdowns. I think we'd follow CDC guidelines and we follow them safely and responsibly and we get opened.

RW: Will you take the vaccine?

LB: I have not decided on that. My husband and I, my children, we are all vaccinated and that's our personal choice. Government never mandated us to be vaccinated with anything. At this time, I don't see that we are in a class of people that need the vaccination. We are healthy. We're young. I am against any sort of government-mandated vaccination. That's not the proper role of government to force injections of any kind in anyone.

RW: You've said that President Donald Trump should continue to contest the results of the election. You were recently quoted in Epoch Times as saying, ""If it needs to go to the House, then I think we have that authority,"" that is to challenge electoral college votes. Congressional conservatives are indeed calling for a floor fight to do that, but the courts have repeatedly rejected President Trump's claims that the election was rigged. Why fight in the Congress if so many courts, I mean, we're talking dozens of decisions, are saying that Biden is the legitimate winner?

LB: This is a contested race and when I sat in the Oval Office with the president of the United States for more than an hour, just last week, I encouraged him to keep fighting, continue to fight for the American people, just like you've done every single day that you have been in office. He has put the American people first, and that's what he's going to continue to do.

RW: What is contested?

LB: I believe Trump has every legal right to continue to investigate this election and prove that every legal vote was counted. The Democrats ran the American people through a sham investigation over a witch hunt with a Russian hoax, and then even a quid pro quo in all of this from a second hand whistleblower.

We're going to say that we have hundreds of affidavits from American citizens who are putting their name to it, who are swearing under oath, that this is true. That we have video footage that we know that we have ballots where signatures were not verified. There is all sorts of things that need to be investigated, and there is nothing unreasonable about investigating it until the very last day.

RW: To guns, before we wrap up, you carry one, the employees of your restaurant in Rifle wear them at work, and you've said that you'll carry in the U.S. Capitol. The AP reports there's a rule against carrying on the floor, I think, of the U.S. House. Is that something you'll try to change?

LB: Absolutely. I'm always pushing boundaries. First of all, I did go through the concealed carry permit process in Washington, D.C., and will be receiving my concealed carry permit. I will be walking to and from my home every day that I'm there to go to work and to come home from work. I don't have Capitol Hill Police escorting me everywhere. I am my security.

I need to make sure that I have a way to defend myself. Washington, D.C., like most Democrat-run cities, has a violent crime problem. I definitely would like to have a way to protect myself, and I will have a way to.

Then, there are some fun ways to get around carrying in the Capitol, and there's transportation rules on how you can carry and transporting in various areas. In my office, I can open carry and have my firearm however I want, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's some sort of push for an amendment to the rules to allow members to carry on the House floor.

RW: One more question, just to pick up on something you've said, you talk about, like, Democrat-run states and Democrat-run cities. Is it good for America to talk about this kind of state, this kind of city versus that kind of city in that kind of state? Is that a unifying message? Is that a helpful message to say, ""DC's Democrat, they're other. They're not us.""?

LB: No, that's what they are. I would be a liar if I said D.C. was a Republican city. If I said that Colorado was Republican ran, I'm saying what it is. This is factual and elections have consequences, and these are the policies that are being put forward in these types of governments.

You don't see Republican-ran states being shut down and the rights of their people taken to the extent that you do in Democrat states, so it's not about unifying. Maybe it's about enlightening somebody that says, ""Hey, you have these problems."" Look at the Californians who are fleeing. We have Californian refugees fleeing and coming to states like Texas and Colorado.

Unfortunately here in Colorado, those Californians who are fleeing those terrible policies from that blue state, that Democrat state, they're fleeing that state and coming to Colorado and bringing their policies with them. But they're coming to places like Aspen. They're coming to Steamboat Springs, these high mountain ski resort towns, because they can actually afford to live there, but they're bringing these same terrible policies with them and implementing them here. Then they're going to be running from them once again.

RW: I want to thank you for your time, and I hope to check back in with you as you begin to serve, come January.

LB: Absolutely. Thank you so much.","On whether the Affordable Care Act should be eliminated:""I've never really made a stance, taken a stance, on keeping or eliminating ACA.

UK-based Mobile Power was set up in 2013 to serve the needs of end-users that are underserved by existing rural electrification models in the region. Currently, the company has operations in Sierra Leone and Liberia, two of the poorest countries in the world where most of the population live on less than US$1.25 a day.

Following this week’s completion of a £2 million Series A funding round led by REPP’s equity investment, Mobile Power is now set for rapid expansion, with plans to enter the Nigerian market next year whilst supporting various existing partnership projects in Uganda, Zambia and Gambia.

Through Mobile Power’s innovative rental model, customers are able to rent smart 50Wh lithium-ion batteries at a low cost and in 24-hour increments. Customers can make payments either in cash or using mobile money, making the service inclusive to those without mobile money or areas with weak phone signal. And unlike many other electrification solutions, the product requires no consumer debt or long-term commitment.

The batteries are suitable for lighting, phone charging, fans, TVs and radios and are charged at solar-powered “MOPO Hubs”, providing a lower carbon option to other local alternatives, which include diesel generator-powered charging stations and battery-powered torches.

Geoff Sinclair, Managing Director of REPP’s investment manager, Camco Clean Energy, said: “Providing affordable energy access to some of the world’s poorest communities is a huge challenge for developers, but one that must be overcome if we are to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

“Mobile Power’s novel business model provides a scalable solution that, with the support of REPP and the other Series A investors, has great potential for rapid growth and delivering far-reaching impact.”

Prior to the funding round, Mobile Power had raised approximately £1.1m in equity from early-stage investors, and a further £1.7m during 2019 in the form of innovation grants and loans.

Chris Longbottom, CEO of Mobile Power, said: “The completion of this Series A fundraise represents a vote of confidence for Mobile Power’s unique approach to energy access, particularly in those markets where traditional approaches are less viable. We look forward to scaling up and reaching many more off-grid customers.”","London, 11 December 2020: The Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP), funded by the UK Government’s International Climate Finance, has invested £1 million into a renewables-powered battery rental company that provides affordable energy access to off-grid communities in West Africa.

The fact is, it’s nearly impossible to build dense housing of any sort without sewers.

You might recall, the proposed Hope Partnership development on Neck Road in Old Lyme would have provided just 37 units of affordable housing on septic and still required a loophole and a subdivide to get around Connecticut’s stringent environmental laws.

But here’s the rub. Old Lyme has sewers, or will soon enough. And the tie-in is just a stone’s throw away from the site on Hatchetts Hill. But the developer has been so far stymied by state and federal rules that discourage the use of Clean Water Funds to subsidize additional development. The idea of the state-federal program is to help ‘to fix what’s broken,’ not fund new environmental problems.

And because Clean Water Funds are expected to pay about 25 percent of the cost of installing sewers in Old Lyme, the local developer then might be out of luck if he can’t get East Lyme, Waterford and New London to approve some sort of workaround.

It’s a problem we haven’t heard about much in Connecticut, in part because Old Lyme may be the only town in Connecticut currently installing – rather than extending – sewers. That’s also part of the reason for the tug of war between the neighborhood of Sound View and the Town of Old Lyme, because there is no recent precedent for divvying the costs.

But that’s going to change, along the shoreline at least, with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection beginning studies that micro-target pollution in the near-shore waters of the Long Island Sound. Old Lyme kind of jumped to the head of the line, even before there was a line.

But as the number of sewer projects grows – and the number of projects qualifying for Clean Water Funds likely increases – you have to wonder whether it makes sense for the state, on the one hand, to fund sewer infrastructure, and on the other, force affordable housing to be built someplace else and on septic.



To be clear, it’s unlikely that many sewers projects will be built in Connecticut over the next decades without Clean Water Funds.

A revision to the rules for Clean Water Funds wouldn’t encourage any development the state doesn’t already want built, and it’s exactly the kind of small-bore solution that might help get things accomplished in Connecticut, instead of crafting the perfect epithet for our collective failures, a better carrot or a bigger stick.

And perhaps it’s time for The Day, for Rev. Steven Jungkeit and other housing advocates in the area, who went to the mattresses for a 37-unit development, to show at least a modicum of support for 67 units of affordable housing on Hatchetts Hill or explain why not.

So far, after three attempts over the last weeks, Jungkeit has not yet returned our calls for comment on the project.","Old Lyme has sewers, or will soon enough.

The number of affordable-housing units in the United States that are at risk of regular flooding is expected to triple by 2050 as sea levels rise, according to a new analysis from Climate Central. Half of coastal states had some amount of affordable housing at risk of yearly flooding in the year 2000, according to the analysis. By 2050, affordable housing in every coastal state will be at risk, it says. New York, Atlantic City, and Boston each have thousands of units that will be at risk of “chronic coastal flooding” by 2050, according to the analysis. By 2050, the entire affordable-housing stock of Foster City, California, is expected to be at risk as well, the report says. The researchers also produced an online mapping tool showing the risk to affordable housing stock in different areas.

Sea-level rise will affect cities that aren’t traditionally thought of as coastal as well. Philadelphia is 60 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, for example, but situated on two tidal rivers. Some neighborhoods there with affordable housing already flood regularly. In 2030, according to the Climate Central analysis, 85 affordable housing units in the city will be at regular risk of flooding. By 2100, the number is expected to grow to 253. Across the U.S., an estimated 24,518 units will be at risk of flooding by 2050, up from 7,669 in 2000, according to the analysis.

“Understanding current and future exposure of affordable housing to flood-risk events, including the number of units that could be affected and how often, can support strategic resilience planning,” the researchers conclude. “In the cities and states with the greatest threats, flood-threat reduction measures, such as building retrofits or flood-proofing, and land-use regulatory policies are tools for stakeholders to protect affordable housing stock, and the lives and livelihoods of those who live there.”

Tacoma Homeless Residents Briefly Occupy Vacant School

“Roughly ten” people experiencing homelessness in Tacoma, Washington, briefly took over a vacant public school before being removed by police last month, echoing other protest occupations this year in Oakland, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia, according to a report in The Stranger.

The group, Tacoma Housing Now, was responding to the recent deaths of two unhoused Tacomans, according to the report. They had a list of six demands, including that the school be placed into a community land trust along with enough additional housing to serve every person experiencing homelessness, the report says. The residents who occupied the school, who had been living in an encampment under a bridge, told The Stranger that the city’s shelter system was insufficient. The school building had been vacant for more than a decade and has dangerous mold, asbestos, and structural conditions, according to the report.

Police told the occupiers that they could either leave the building or face felony charges, and the residents decided to leave voluntarily after a few hours of negotiations, according to the report.

They have launched a fundraiser to pay for new camping supplies and to “replace items that the cops wouldn’t let residents retrieve.”

Even though the occupation was short-lived, Tacoma Housing Now organizer Rebecca Parson told The Stranger, residents “finally feel like someone’s talking about what they’re going through, and it’s getting some attention.”

Tampa Offers Forgivable Loans to Landlords of Affordable Housing

The City of Tampa launched a program last month to loan money from the federal CARES Act to landlords of affordable housing who have lost significant rental income during the pandemic, according to a report in the Tampa Bay Times.

In order to qualify, landlords have to show that they lost at least 25 percent of their rental income between February and July compared to the same period in 2019, according to the report. The program is meant to help landlords cover the cost of necessary maintenance and repairs and keep the city’s affordable-housing stock intact, the report says. The loans will be offered from $100,000 to $500,000 based on the amount that landlords put up themselves, with zero percent interest and forgivable after 10 years as long as landlords keep their units affordable. According to the city’s website, the goals of the program are “to stave off evictions due to uninhabitable units, to allow for monitoring of affordable units, to improve housing conditions, [and] to develop a relationship with affordable apartment owners to help house homeless and others seeking affordable rentals.”

According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, 90.3 percent of tenants had paid full or partial rent for last month by November 20, down 1.6 percent from the previous year. Many cities launched their own small rental-assistance programs during the pandemic. In addition to Tampa’s landlord-assistance program, Philadelphia runs a rental-assistance program that makes rent payments directly to landlords, as does Virginia. Washington, D.C., recently launched a $10 million grant program to help landlords cover lost rents as well, as DCist reported.","Half of coastal states had some amount of affordable housing at risk of yearly flooding in the year 2000, according to the analysis.

What Are Affordable CBD Oils?

With all the CBD brands that are out on the market today, it's guaranteed that the prices of oils will vary between them all. Most people are mistakenly under the assumption that affordable oils are inferior oils. This simply is not true. It is possible to purchase affordable CBD oils that are also of superior quality and that are clean, organic, potent, and effective. There are certain criteria that help to decide both the quality as well as the price of CBD oils. Those are potency, extraction method, hemp source, and independent third-party lab testing. Potency — How much CBD is in a tincture will determine how strong it is. The more CBD there is per milliliter in a product, the more potent the tincture will be. The strength and potency of the product you choose should be determined by what you are trying to accomplish with it. For example, if you have extreme pain from a chronic health condition, you will want a stronger, more potent CBD oil. Conversely, if you're only wanting to support your general health, then you will want to go with a lower strength. Extraction Method — There are a few methods in which CBD is extracted out of the hemp plant. Those methods include steam distillation, ethanol (solvent) extraction, Co2 extraction, and hydrocarbon extraction. Out of all of these methods, Co2 extraction is the cleanest and most effective because it pulls out higher levels of CBD from the hemp plant. Lastly, of all the methods mentioned, hydrocarbon extraction is the least preferred because it deposits dangerous toxins in the final product. Hemp Sources — CBD comes from the hemp and marijuana plants. The overall quality of the hemp will have a large role in determining how much a product costs. Organic hemp that is clean and pesticide-free, herbicide-free, and chemical-free produces the highest quality CBD oils. CBD brands that use organic hemp will have products that are slightly more expensive than brands that use hemp that is not carefully crafted to be of the best quality. Independent Third-Party Lab Testing — Before you purchase any type of CBD product, you should look on the brand's website to see if you can find independent third-party lab test reports. Even though you are purchasing affordable CBD, you should still know what you are putting into your body. The lab tests will confirm the safety and potency of the products you are purchasing.

Is It Safe To Purchase Affordable CBD Oils? Even though it's quite simple to shop online and purchase CBD oil, you should consider the safety, potency, and effectiveness of the oil before spending money on any products. One way to find out more about the products you wish to purchase is read through independent lab reports. These reports offer a host of valuable information about the product that will help you make an informed decision before buying. Only in taking the time to do the proper research will you know if it is safe to purchase an affordable oil from any particular brand. The extraction process that the brand uses is also key to oil safety. Full-spectrum CBD products contain beneficial cannabinoid compounds. Two of the main compounds are cannabidiol, or CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. While CBD will not cause any feelings of euphoria, THC will. All full-spectrum CBD oils must legally contain less than 0.3% THC. Therefore, full-spectrum oils do not have any euphoric side effects. There are many ways to extract CBD from hemp and marijuana plants. It's important to know how the oil was extracted in order to ensure that you do not purchase a CBD oil that is laden with toxins. So while it might be tempting to purchase cheap CBD oils, it's better to buy affordable oils from reputable brands instead of cheap oils from brands that potentially cut corners and use inferior ingredients as well as less preferred extraction methods that leave toxins in the extracts.

Guidelines For Buying Affordable CBD Oils Before you purchase affordable CBD oils, there are a few guidelines that you should follow in order to ensure that you are getting a clean, potent, top-notch product. Some of those guidelines are as follows: Only purchase CBD oils from a respected brand. If you find a brand that piques your interest, spend some time researching the brand. Learn how the brand started, who founded it, what the brand's mission is, how the products are made, whether an independent lab was used to test products, whether the lab reports are easy for customers to find, and if the brand has a solid customer service department, among other things.

Look to the internet as a resource to help you find a reputable brand with high-quality, affordable products. Any reputable brand will have a trustworthy e-commerce system and will also ship your purchase directly to you. A brand's website is a wonderful place to read about CBD, learn more about the company, read up on its oils, and possibly find out how much of the brand's oil you can take to start. Pour through independent third-party lab reports. In order to prove the safety, effectiveness, and purity of its products, many reputable brands use a third-party lab to test its products. Those results should be easy for customers to find on the brand's website. Before purchasing anything from any brand, locate the lab testing of a product that you are interested in. Take some time to pour over those results. It's important to know exactly what you will be putting inside of your body. Pour through independent third-party lab reports.

CBD, The Endocannabinoid System, And The Entourage Effect The Entourage Effect Full-spectrum CBD oils contain a host of beneficial compounds, phytonutrients, and terpenes. Two of the main cannabinoid compounds are cannabidiol, or CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When these compounds combine with each other, they produce an entourage effect. In the entourage effect, the compounds bring down each other's negative side effects while elevating each other's positive side effects. For example, sometimes too much THC causes nausea. Since it's legally required to have less than 0.3% THC in all full-spectrum products, the cannabidiol in the tincture is able to effectively work with the THC to decrease or eliminate that side effect. Therefore, you will be able to have effective pain relief without any worry about getting nauseous. The Endocannabinoid System Every human has an endocannabinoid system that works to regulate bodily functions and sensations. In that endocannabinoid system are two receptors, CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptors that are found throughout the body work to regulate pain, emotion, movement, thinking, appetite, memories, and other functions. The CB2 receptors that are located within the immune system work to regulate inflammation and pain. When a full-spectrum oil enters into the body, THC will latch onto the CB1 receptors while CBD will attach itself to both the CB1 and CB2 receptors to help the body create its own endocannabinoids.

Benefits, Dosing, And Safety Benefits Multiple research studies have effectively proven that CBD can help with issues such as: Anxiety

Depression

Sleep issues

Chronic pain

Nerve pain

Arthritis

Muscle aches

Epilepsy

Fibromyalgia

Parkinson's Disease

PTSD

Dosage When it comes to figuring out the best dose to take, it's important to understand that there is not one set dose that will work the best for everyone. Everybody is different, therefore everyone's body responds differently to CBD. Lower strength oils such as 300mg and 500mg work well for general health and minor issues. However, higher strengths such as 1200mg and 2400mg work best for more difficult health issues and more intense symptoms. When you're ready to take your first dose, always remember to start low and go slow. The best guidelines to follow are to begin with 5ml, or half a dropper full once a day for one week. After a week has elapsed, do a full-body check-in to see how you're feeling. If you aren't achieving your desired effect, then bump up the dosage to 5ml, or half a dropper full twice a day for one week. This comes to 10mg a day. After one week, increase again if needed. Remember, your body needs time to adjust to both the CBD as well as the dosage. Safety When compared to prescription medications, CBD comes with very few side effects. Moreover, those side effects are extremely mild. If you have concerns about how CBD will interact with your medications or other holistic supplements, then please call your doctor, specialist, or pharmacist. Some common side effects of CBD are: Drowsiness

Dizziness

Diarrhea

Changes in Appetite

Mild nausea If you're taking prescription medication, then you might be familiar with the Grapefruit Rule. Put simply, the rule states that some medications cannot be taken with grapefruit or other citrus fruits and juices. CBD functions in very much the same way. Some medications, when combined with grapefruit, other citrus fruits, or CBD will cause a dramatic change in the way that your body metabolizes medications. Medication will either be metabolized too slowly, where you will not receive enough of the medication into your system, or too quickly, where you will receive too much medication into your system. Too much medication in your system is dangerous and has the potential to cause extreme side effects or even an overdose. Not enough medication in your system will cause health conditions to not be treated effectively.

If you're not able to take CBD oil, there are other options. Keep in mind that CBD salves, lotions, and other topical creams are another great alternative. However, in thinking about all of the dangerous side effects that stem from long-term use of prescription medication, CBD is a wonderful alternative treatment overall. As stated before, numerous studies confirm CBD's effectiveness in helping to treat anxiety, depression, chronic pain, nerve issues, insomnia, and many other health/medical conditions.

Our Final Thoughts On Our Most Affordable CBD Oils List There is a huge difference between purchasing an affordable CBD oil and purchasing a cheap CBD oil. While cheap CBD oils may feel better to your wallet, there's no guarantee that they will be clean, safe, or effective. You can still purchase high-quality, affordable, top-shelf oils from reputable brands. Before you purchase any products, remember to take some time to do your research. If you find a brand that you're interested in, dig deeply on the brand's website for its backstory, independent third-party lab test results, and verified customer reviews. Only then will you know if you will be putting the best, purest, most effective oil into your body. Growing, harvesting, and extraction methods make a huge difference as well. If an oil is not extracted from hemp that's organic, pesticide free, chemical-free, and herbicide-free, then you run the risk of putting dangerous chemicals into your body. Likewise, if an oil is not made with the clean, industry-preferred Co2 extraction process, then chances are, there might be chemicals lingering around inside the final product. Always read through independent third-party lab tests for any and every product that you're interested in. Only then will you know how safe, potent, and clean the product is. Furthermore, the brand you are interested in should make it easy for customers to find those lab results on its website. A huge red flag should raise for you if you find a brand that does not use an independent laboratory to frequently test every product. Likewise, if you have a difficult time locating the lab results, that might be another issue to consider.","If you've been wanting to try CBD oil but have been concerned about the price, know that not only can you purchase affordable CBD oil, but you also can purchase high quality CBD oil at those affordable prices.

Affordable access to solar energy and battery storage to help all local homeowners, businesses and non-profits become more resilient, reduce energy expenses and save on the cost of renewable energy systems are the goals of the new coalition of community partner organizations.

The more St. Thomas property owners that participate, the greater the savings for all.

“For the first time in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a local coalition has formed to help make solar energy more affordable to all,” said Doug White, a St. Thomas resident and local green architect. “Through this campaign, we have an opportunity to both significantly raise awareness of the benefits of this renewable source of power and to lower the cost to access it by leveraging the power of group purchasing.”

Coalition organizations involved in partnering to ensure Solarize St. Thomas is a success include Rotary Club of St. Thomas East ECO, UVI’s Caribbean Green Technology Center, the Environmental Association of St. Thomas-St. John, the Virgin Islands Conservation Society, the VI Electric Vehicle Assoc.-North, Solar Crowdsource as well as the Virgin Islands Energy Office.

Solar energy design and installation companies have bid to become the sole provider of equipment and installation services for Solarize St. Thomas. The installation company will be announced before the campaign begins along with descriptions of tiered pricing and equipment options.

Starting with an official campaign launch on Jan. 14 and throughout the first half of 2021, Solarize St. Thomas will put on a series of clean energy education and community outreach events with a goal of increasing participation and encouraging all solar and battery installations to be complete by the end of next year.

“Valuable federal tax credits for homeowners will be available in 2021. WAPA is also offering a new ‘Net Billing’ program,” said Don Moreland, founder of Solar Crowdsource, the firm administering the program. “Our goal is to help educate local residents about these incentives and programs, demonstrate the benefits of solar energy and battery storage systems, and make it easy to get a free proposal from a trusted source. Then, with the power of bulk purchasing, we can achieve volume discounts on materials and installation services.”

Solarize St. Thomas is now accepting advance registrations for the upcoming program. Interested residents may go to www.solarizestt.com now to learn more about the program, get advance information on campaign details, register for the launch event and sign up for a free evaluation.","The Coalition for Solar Affordability is preparing to launch Solarize St. Thomas, a community-based group purchasing program, during January 2021.

393,https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/20/neocharge-smart-splitter-permits-dual-use-of-220-volt-outlets/,"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",CleanTechnica,"Easier, Affordable Home Electric Vehicle Charging Access with NeoCharge","By Steve Hanley

One thing that all electric cars have in common is they need to be charged. But many people who might be interested in buying one do not have a 220 volt outlet available to plug a charger into. That means they need to hire an electrician to add a new circuit. But electricians aren’t magicians. Charging an EV may require as many amps as an electric stove or clothes dryer. If the entry panel where the circuit breakers are located hasn’t been updated recently, it may not be able to handle the extra load. Upgrading the existing service can cost thousands of dollars.

NeoCharge* has a solution. Many residences have an existing 220 volt outlet in the garage or in a room nearby, but it is typically already in use by a core appliance (like a dryer). The NeoCharge Smart Splitter can plug right into that outlet and provide electricity access for both the appliance already using it and an electric car charger. Yes, the Smart Splitter will intelligently power an EV charger and an electric dryer, stove, or other appliance without any changes to the electrical panel and without adding a new circuit. The secret is that the Smart Splitter automatically switches between your appliance and your car depending on which needs power more urgently.

How It Works

When you run your appliance, the Smart Splitter will pause your car charger to ensure easy charging. When the dryer is done, the Smart Splitter will automatically resume charging your car. The Dual-Car Smart Splitter allows for easy charging of two electric cars. The device will charge one car at full power then switch over to charge a second car at full power. Or, if you would like to charge both of your cars at the same time, the Smart Splitter can also be set to charge both cars simultaneously at half the power.

No need to install another circuit or get an expensive panel upgrade by using NeoCharge’s Dual Car Smart Splitter.

Because the Smart Splitter is an internet-connected device and can be easily controlled through a smartphone app, a person who buys an electric car can purchase a less expensive home charger than commonly marketed “smart chargers” — because the Smart Splitter adds the “intelligence” that a customer typically wants from a smart charger. In areas where the local utility company offers lower rates at certain times of the day, the Smart Splitter will schedule charging to take place when demand is low, saving the homeowner or renter even more money.

The installation of home EV charging equipment can range from $750 to $1750 without the need for a panel upgrade. When an electrical panel upgrade is needed, the installation cost can be as high as $5,000. The Smart Splitter is the smarter way to install home EV charging, without the need for these expensive installation costs.

Now through January 3, there’s a special holiday price for a Smart Splitter that can control two EV chargers — just $474.00. Alternatively, the Smart Splitter that controls an EV charger and an appliance sells for just $424.00. Both can be ordered directly from NeoCharge on the company’s website.

Here are a few testimonials from customers who made the decision to buy a Smart Splitter:

“Your device allows us to more easily electrify our home and transportation, thus reducing our carbon footprint. Thank you!”

“This weekend I installed both your units without any problems. The first has the induction cooktop on the primary, and the heat pump water heater on the secondary. The second has one EV charger on the primary and another on the secondary.

“I tested the one for the EVs and it worked perfectly.”

“You’ve saved me from having to get a whole new panel. Thank you!”

Benefits Of The Smart Splitter

It’s not only electric car owners who can benefit from Smart Splitter technology. Manufacturers, car dealers, utility companies, EVSE retailers, and electricians can do so as well. Manufacturers and dealers can take advantage of the simplicity and low cost of the Smart Splitter to promote electric cars to their customers. Anything that makes a sales transaction go more smoothly is good for business. Prospective customers who may have concerns about charging an electric vehicle may feel reassured when they learn how easy it is to install a Smart Splitter.

Utility companies have only one product — electricity. They can promote the sale of electric cars by educating their customers about how easy it is to plug in using a Smart Splitter. Many homeowners would be delighted to learn they can power two appliances from one existing outlet and take advantage of lower “Time of Use” rates without expensive electrical upgrades.

Electricians can save their customers time and money by introducing them to the Smart Splitter, which may be especially helpful to people who rent rather than own — a whole new market for electricians to explore. Retailers who sell EV charging equipment could expand their customer base by offering the Smart Splitter together with their other products.

The Smart Splitter is a clever, cost effective way to get more people involved in the EV revolution. Electric cars are new to most people and that newness creates concerns. The Smart Splitter can help eliminate those concerns and make people comfortable with the idea of owning an electric car.

This brings forward the UK’s previous 80 per cent target by nearly 15 years.

The CCC’s chairman, Lord Deben, said: “As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, the sixth carbon budget is a chance to jump-start the UK’s economic recovery.”

Established under the Climate Change Act 2008 the CCC is an independent, statutory body that produces carbon budgets that the country is legally bound to follow to reduce its carbon emissions in line with the science.

Its sixth carbon budget describes how the UK could get to the net zero goal.

How to reach net zero

By the early 2030s, this CCC says that every new car and van, and every replacement boiler must be zero-carbon, and by 2035, all UK electricity production will be zero carbon.

Modern low-carbon industries will grow, producing hydrogen, capturing carbon, creating new woodlands, and by renovating and decarbonising the UK’s 28 million homes. These provide hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the UK.

The sixth carbon budget has four key steps:

By the early 2030s, all new cars and vans and all boiler replacements in homes and other buildings would be low-carbon – largely electric.

By 2040, all new trucks are low-carbon and industry will shift to using renewable electricity or hydrogen instead of fossil fuels, or captures its carbon emissions, storing them safely under the sea.

There will be huge reliance on offshore wind, which will grow from the Prime Minister’s promised 40GW in 2030 to 100GW or more by 2050.

It will support transport, heating and industry, pushing up electricity demand by a half over the next 15 years, and doubling or even trebling demand by 2050.

By this date, low-carbon hydrogen would scale up to be almost as large as electricity production is today, to power shipping, transport and industry, and potentially some buildings, replacing natural gas for heating.

Steel and cement production will have to reach “near zero” emissions by 2035 and 2040.

The country will become much more resource and energy efficient. The CCC advocates a nation-wide insulation drive.

By 2035, 460,000 hectares of new mixed woodland would be planted to remove CO2 and deliver wider environmental benefits.

Around 260,000 hectares of farmland would instead be producing energy crops. Wooded land will cover 15 per cent of the UK by 2035 and 18 per cent by 2050, from 13 per cent today, with two billion new trees planted.

Carbon-storing peatlands would be widely restored and managed sustainably.

Behaviour change will pay a key part. On dietary shift, the CCC says consumption of red meat and dairy should decline by a modest 20 per cent by 2030 and 35 per cent by 2050.

The CCC puts the cost under 1 per cent of GDP, but there will be huge benefits in terms of better health and an improved natural environment. It also advocates that there should be a just transition, with anyone employed in fossil fuel industries compensated and retrained.

Buildings

Retrofitting buildings would need over 200,000 extra jobs from 2030 to 2050.

On the proposal that after 2028 no home should be sold without an energy efficiency rating (EPC) of C or better, Julie Hirigoyen from the UK Green Building called this “radical but welcome”.

Graph: Breakdown of buildings sector greenhouse gas emissions (2019)

Buildings are presently responsible for 59 per cent of UK electricity consumption and for direct emissions of 85 MtCO? in 2019, split between homes (77 per cent), commercial buildings (14 per cent) and public buildings (9 per cent).

Graph: Direct CO? emissions from the buildings sector since 1990. So far, cutting emissions from commercial buildings has proved the most difficult of all sectors

The CCC advocates ultra-high standards of energy efficiency in new homes from 2025 at the latest, delivered through measures such as triple glazing and high levels of airtightness. The government has recently signalled it will bring forward the date of introduction of these requirements to 2023.

New evidence on the costs and performance of thin internal wall insulation, and deep whole house retrofits have been incorporated in the modelling.

Interestingly, the assumptions show that only air to air heat pumps would achieve the same low levelised cost as gas boilers. But heat pumps are only effective in highly insulated buildings. Therefore, they are not suitable for most existing homes at present.

Reactions

Commenting on the report, Greenpeace’s Dr Doug Parr said: “We’ll need much more legwork from the government over this parliament to reach [these aims]. While some progress has been made recently there remains a yawning gap between our targets over the next decade and action needed to meet them straight away.”

Trade unions welcomed the call for a “Just Transition Strategy” to reach net zero emissions. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said “to reach net zero, we need a shared sense of national purpose. Everyone must understand how they will benefit from a climate-safe economy, clean air, healthy land, restored wildlife and new green industries.

“For working people, a just transition means knowing that job security and quality is guaranteed, with training for the great new jobs in green industries. This must begin quickly, to prevent mass unemployment following the pandemic. By fast-tracking public investment in green infrastructure, the government can create over a million jobs in the next two years.”

The TUC has published its own research identifying 1.25 million jobs that can be created in green infrastructure over the next two years.

Martin Harper, at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “The CCC report highlights the vital role nature plays in locking up carbon. Now the UK government needs to pick up the gauntlet, stop burning our precious peatland and invest in restoring nature for wildlife, for people and for a safer climate.”

But Nick Phillips, at the Woodland Trust, said: “On current trends, we will get nowhere near this [tree cover] target. Policies like the upcoming England Tree Strategy and new farm payments system need to be visionary and bold.”

14Trees, a LafargeHolcim joint venture with CDC Group, a United Kingdom-based investor, is deploying 3D printing technology at scale to build affordable and low-carbon housing and schools in Africa, starting in Malawi.

With its high speed of construction and optimized material use, this technology reduces the carbon footprint for building new homes by up to 70%.

Pioneering this technology in schools for the first time, 14Trees aims to address the country’s chronic infrastructure shortage while creating skilled local jobs.

Using proprietary LafargeHolcim ink, the 3D printing process will significantly reduce the time and cost of building housing and schools in Malawi. UNICEF estimates a current shortage of 36,000 classrooms in Malawi, which would take 70 years to build using conventional methods.

According to 14Trees, this infrastructure gap could be bridged in just 10 years using 3D printing. Partnering with a range of non-governmental organizations, 14Trees is working to solve the chronic shortage at scale, starting with families and communities most in need.

The project in Malawi relied on local 14Trees teams trained by LafargeHolcim and COBOD, the 3D printing specialists. The teams included 3D machine operators, architects, civil and structural engineers and materials specialists. The project also involved nearly 40 people in the preparation of the 3D ink and in the construction with building trades such as carpenters, roofers and painters.

The walls of 14Trees’ first prototype house were built in Lilongwe in just 12 hours, compared to almost four days using conventional methods. The walls of its first school, built in Salima, were printed in just 18 hours, as opposed to several days.

“Starting in Malawi, we will deploy this technology across the broader region with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe,"" says Miljan Gutovic, region head Middle East Africa and LafargeHolcim executive committee member.","LafargeHolcim is working to produce 3D printed concrete for affordable housing in countries such as Malawi and Ecuador, pictured here.
14Trees, a LafargeHolcim joint venture with CDC Group, a United Kingdom-based investor, is deploying 3D printing technology at scale to build affordable and low-carbon housing and schools in Africa, starting in Malawi.
Using proprietary LafargeHolcim ink, the 3D printing process will significantly reduce the time and cost of building housing and schools in Malawi.
According to 14Trees, this infrastructure gap could be bridged in just 10 years using 3D printing.
The project in Malawi relied on local 14Trees teams trained by LafargeHolcim and COBOD, the 3D printing specialists."

Here are a few tips to start implementing and planning form the CEOs.

Vikas Chaturvedi, CEO of Xanadu Realty - Drive Innovation in every aspect of the business



- Absorb and accept technology in your organization to take your product to the customers



- Take initiative and bring smarter consumer propositions to take care of worries of a consumer while buying property



- Reskill your teams for the new scenarios



- Mitigate risk and judicious cash management. Most importantly stay positive during this time.

Roma Priya, Founder of Burgeon Law - In order to mitigate any risks, it is important for companies to adapt to a new set of rules while being careful with tracking expenses against the revenue status, checking the feasibility of the business model, and planning policies for the next quarter



- There needs to be a diligent revision of sales, revenue goals and product timelines along with a new operating plan in place. Companies should strategize and communicate transparently with the stakeholders and customers to understand their perception of the products/services being offered.



- Also, to avoid bitterness with the contracted parties, companies should give sufficient notice to the vendors, suppliers and landlords in case of any delay in the payments.



- When it comes to the capital, companies should stay patient with fundraising. Considering the criticality of the situation, investors may take longer than usual to make funding decisions after following stringent diligence procedures.

Himanshu Bindal, Founder of Biosup Cost Monitoring: Always monitor your cost and get as lean as possible even when you are not having liquidity challenges. Also, keep an eye on your balance sheet. The better you manage your cash the better your business plans will work out.



Contingency Planning: Planning always saves you from the worst case scenarios. Always have Plan B and if possible Plan C also so that if something goes sideways, your company will not be hit hard as it will be saved by your contingency plans.



Quick Decision Making: Never delay in making decisive decisions in times of trouble. And never be shy about seeking help from outside.



Communicate with Customers: Try to communicate with customers and let them know that they and their reviews on your products matter. Improve and do the changes accordingly, if needed.



Internet: Go online as much as possible because it always helps to reach customers who we cannot tap through offline or other forms of marketing.



Keep Striving: Keep striving to come on top of the industry of which your company is a part of.","Companies should strategize and communicate transparently with the stakeholders and customers to understand their perception of the products/services being offered.

Ltd has raised funding from a UK-based affordable housing impact investor and existing investors, a top executive told VCCircle.

Late last year, the Bengaluru-based developer had inked a financial partnership deal with impact investor Reall. “As part of the partnership, we have been able to raise debt capital of Rs 49.5 crore ($6.7 million) from Reall. The modus operandi of Reall is to strike a partnership with a firm and then invest on a project-to-project basis. This time they have backed us for a project in Ahmedabad and our precast factory,” said Shikha Parakh, general manager – business development and corporate affairs, Janaadhar.

“We are likely to take this partnership ahead and raise more capital in the future on an opportunity basis,” she added.

The latest round has also seen Janaadhar’s existing investor put in additional capital. “Our existing investors including Tree Line, Caspian, Vikram Gandhi and other individual investors have collectively put in around Rs 22.5 crore ($3.1 million). These investors have put capital in the form of equity,” she said.

The Economic Times had first reported the development.

Parakh also said that the company is in talks with a few development finance institutions and banks for raising a bigger round through a mix of debt and equity.VCCircle had reported last year that Janaadhar had brought precast building startup Ingenious Quality Buildings Pvt. Ltd under its fold through a merger.

Reall is funded by the UK’s Department for International Development and the Swedish International Development Agency.

The partnership with the Bengaluru developer marks Reall’s first step in India’s affordable housing segment.

As its core strategy, Janaadhar aims to fill the shortage of 10 million units in affordable housing.

The company says it has delivered 1,500 homes for the economically weaker section and low-income group (LIG) across Karnataka and Gujarat so far. It also claims to be one of the only firms that has successfully delivered LIG houses under Rs 20 lakh via a profitable and scalable model while securing government subsidies for clients.","Ltd has raised funding from a UK-based affordable housing impact investor and existing investors, a top executive told VCCircle.

They are demanding the municipality provide more housing opportunities for poor and working class people in the inner city.

They also want rent control measures to be implemented in the city.

Activist says some landlords had increased rent in some buildings by 200% during lockdown.

Johannesburg residents want dilapidated buildings in the inner city to be developed into housing for poor and working class people. They also want rent control measures and a moratorium on all evictions. These are some of the demands they made in a protest on Wednesday, supported by the Inner City Resource Centre (ICRC).

About 100 people marched from Pieter Roos Park in Parktown to the Gauteng Legislature in Newtown. Some of the other groups participating in the action included the Gauteng Housing Crisis Committee, Robertson Tenants Association, Rivoningo Women’s Forum, Booysens Informal Settlements, Robertsham Tenants Organisation, Turfontein tenants, Orange Grove tenants, SA Social Housing Movement and Southdale tenants.

Marchers held placards which read: “We want affordable housing”, “Water to wash our hands” and “Our voices are many but our purpose is one - #Housing”.

According to the ICRC’s memorandum, the Covid-19 pandemic had demonstrated how the Gauteng government was failing to provide basic services such as running water to people in informal settlements across the province. “We have forced our inclusion into various government schemes and Imbizos purported to provide solutions for the housing crisis in Johannesburg and the Gauteng province in general. Much of that energy and resources has led to no tangible results,” read the memorandum.

The group also demanded the City implement the Rapid Land Release programme and housing for all backyard and shack dwellers.

“How can the government talk about washing your hands when in Booysens informal settlement for example, there is no running water?” asked protest organiser, Ayesha Rajah.

She said that many communities decided to join ICRC’s march because they faced the same issues. Rajah said that in Turffontein the biggest problem was landlords who “think they are above the law.”

She said landlords had increased rent in some buildings by 200% “in the middle of a pandemic.” (GroundUp has not verified this.) She said those landlords also used illegal electricity connections “which means they are stealing from the City and the tenants”.

Doctor Mokwena, a resident of Orange Grove who joined the march, said the City must stop evictions immediately and halt the sale of land initially earmarked for housing.

“We want the government to give us houses and not empty promises. If they can’t do that, they must give us land and we will build our own houses,” he said.

The memorandum was handed to Mthuthuzeli Siboze from the Gauteng Rapid Response Team, who agreed to respond to the memorandum within seven working days.","They are demanding the municipality provide more housing opportunities for poor and working class people in the inner city.

For many Vancouverites, Marpole is out of sight and out of mind.

Tucked away on the southwest side of the city, it's never been a major ""destination neighbourhood"" for those coming from other parts of the city, unlike Main Street, West 4th Avenue, or Commercial Drive.

But over the years, I've discovered some delightful dining spots in Marpole at affordable prices. One of them is Talay Thai Restaurant (8369 Granville Street), which is exceptionally clean and comfy.

In fact, it was one of my go-to places for takeout when all the restaurants were closed after the pandemic was declared.

Long before masks were mandated in indoor public spaces—back in March—Talay Thai staff were wearing them and placing hand sanitizer at the front door. It was very comforting.

Talay Thai struck me as a place where the employees were truly concerned about not spreading COVID-19.

Last night, I returned to Talay Thai to enjoy the mixed seasonal vegetables (Pad Num Mun Hoi) and stir-fried chicken with roasted cashew nuts, onions, celery, bell peppers, and fried chilies (Pad Med Mamuang Himaphan).

What sets Talay Thai apart from other Thai restaurants is its gentle spicing. The only way you're going to set your mouth on fire is if you accidentally bite into one of the chili peppers.

The dishes aren't bland; they're just seasoned with less of those in-your-face spices. It's very nuanced.

Another appealing aspect of Talay Thai is the prices—they seem to be charging what I used to pay back in 2000 or 2005 at some restaurants. Perhaps the lower rents in Marpole make this possible.

The two dishes mentioned above, plus taxes, came in at less than $30. That's not a normal occurrence on the West Side of Vancouver.

Restaurants need the public's help

It's worth noting that there's no shortage of superb restaurants across Metro Vancouver. The owners, chefs, and other staff are coming to the end of an absolutely brutal year with no relief in sight.

Some of the hardest hit have been higher-end establishments, which didn't have a history of offering takeout before the pandemic.

They sometimes went to great lengths to make their dining rooms as safe as possible by improving the ventilation. But this second wave of COVID-19 has put many of these businesses in jeopardy.

One way to cheer them up would be to order in a big meal to ring in the New Year, if you can afford it.

For many years, Vancouver has been defined by its restaurants as a cosmopolitan, welcoming city. They're central to the city's culture.

Now is the time to let them know how much they're appreciated for doing this.","One of them is Talay Thai Restaurant (8369 Granville Street), which is exceptionally clean and comfy.

410,https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/12/18/at-10-years-old-the-affordable-care-act-is-aging-badly/,"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Daily Signal,"At 10 Years Old, the Affordable Care Act Is Aging Badly","Another open season has come and gone in which eligible Americans could choose from a narrow array of federally subsidized health care plans under the Affordable Care Act.

Despite the ACA’s manifest gaps and failures, a recent poll from the left-leaning Kaiser Family Foundation found that a solid majority—55%—of respondents have a favorable perception of the law. That result may be due in part to a feature of the law most have heard about and support: its ban on private insurers denying coverage for preexisting conditions.

The ACA is much more than that provision, however. By almost any measure, the law has fallen short of its objectives. It included features that proved unpopular or unsustainable, led to a decade-long court battle with—of all groups—an order of Catholic nuns devoted to the poor, and it subsidized elective abortion without subscribers’ knowledge in violation of what the law plainly requires.

The ACA was modeled in part on a Massachusetts health plan that created a statewide exchange, or marketplace, offering a menu of plans individuals and families could choose from, with gradations of coverage and cost. The ACA contained a mandate, since nullified by Congress, that each individual and family have a plan in force year-round.

But a withering report earlier this year from The Heritage Foundation underscores just how far short the law has fallen.

The promise of the ACA was better coverage at lower cost. Everyone remembers President Barack Obama’s sober pledge that American families would enjoy $2,500 in annual savings on their premiums and be able to keep their doctors. The Heritage report shows, instead, that in just five years, from 2013 to 2018, the average monthly premium paid by an individual rose from $244 to $550 a month, a more than 125% increase.

At the same time, the mid-tier quality plan on the federal exchange saw its annual deductible rise by more than $1,000. Provider networks, in turn, typically shrank.

Putative innovations under the ACA fared no better. The year 2020 saw the end of multi-state plans. These were private plans sold on the marketplace by insurance companies under contract with the federal government that were supposed to attract more subscribers while lowering costs.

In addition, the federal Multi-State Plan Program was required to guarantee individuals and families both a pro-life option and an elective abortion option in the states where they existed.

But multi-state plans proved unpopular with insurance companies, as became embarrassingly apparent when the number of multi-state plans was reduced from 203 to two between 2017 and 2019, and finally nonexistent this year. Co-op plans seem headed for the same fate.

Today, most U.S. counties have only one or two exchange plans. These are the plans for which federal premium tax credits are available.

The tax credits mean that abortion coverage is being subsidized with tax dollars in many instances. Just how often this occurs has been a regular focus of Charlotte Lozier Institute and Family Research Council—this year joined by The Heritage Foundation.

What we found for the 2021 plan year continues to be disturbing.

There are 24 states, plus the District of Columbia, that allow elective abortion coverage. In total, these states offer 1,296 plans, and a full 69% of them—892 plans—cover elective abortion. Eight states fail to offer a single pro-life alternative insurance plan on the ACA marketplace, several of them due to state legislative mandates.

Fortunately, 26 states have exercised their option under the ACA to bar from their exchanges any plans that cover abortion beyond the limited exceptions under the Hyde Amendment—that is, in cases where the life of the mother is at risk, rape, or incest.

Now 10 years old, the Affordable Care Act needs to be revisited. It covers fewer than half the estimated 24 million people its authors estimated would be helped.

Rather than chase the Little Sisters of the Poor with mandates to provide no-cost coverage of contraceptives and abortifacients for their employees, Congress should apply the Hyde Amendment permanently and pursue support for patient-centered, life-affirming plans. These plans should meet the needs of subscribers at all stages of life.

Congress should also ensure that every health care plan has full transparency, so purchasers are aware of any controversial practices the plan covers. The ACA’s requirement that abortion premiums be paid separately—now enjoined by a federal court—should be enforced.

Conscience is a key element of a free and robust society in every sector, but especially health care. A decade on from enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the need for patient- and family-centered alternatives in health care is more acute than ever.","Another open season has come and gone in which eligible Americans could choose from a narrow array of federally subsidized health care plans under the Affordable Care Act.

411,https://www.governmentnews.com.au/city-of-melbourne-commits-to-affordable-housing-plan/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Government News,City of Melbourne commits to affordable housing plan,"City of Melbourne has committed to increasing the supply of affordable housing as part of a ten year strategy.

Sally Capp

Under the proposed Affordable Housing Strategy 2030, which was endorsed by Council on Tuesday, up to 25 per cent of all future residential development on land owned by the City of Melbourne would be dedicated to affordable housing.

It also proposes leasing a council-owned site to a community housing provider and commiting another site for a supported housing project.

Lord Mayor Sally Capp says Melbourne had a shortfall of at least 5500 affordable rental homes in 2019 and that’s expected to hit 23,200 by 2036.

More than 1700 people are currently experiencing homelessness.

“We recognise that a vibrant and inclusive city relies on a diverse community and a range of housing options,” Cr Capp said.

“It’s expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to an even greater demand for affordable homes in the short term.”

Priorities to increase supply

The strategy contains a number of priorities for increasing the supply of affordable rental housing in the municipality, which can be developed and managed by registered community housing organisations.

It says up to 150 affordable rental homes could be built on City-owned land, while more than 1,600 could be built via mandatory inclusion zoning and value capture in urban renewal areas.

The strategy also proposes considering an affordable housing levy for all businesses and houses in Victoria, similar to the fire services levy, which it says could provide 1,350 homes.

The City of Melbourne is currently working in collaboration with property developer PDG Corporation to deliver 48 affordable housing units at the Munro development alongside the Queen Victoria Market, and on plans for 40 affordable housing units at the Boyd development in Southbank.

Cr Capp said the City of Melbourne welcomed the state government’s recent $5.3 billion commitment to construct more than 12,000 new social and affordable homes.

“We look forward to working closely with the Victorian Government and industry to deliver affordable housing in the municipality as part of Victoria’s Big Housing Build,” she said.

Building more affordable housing would bring benefits residents and the economy, Cr Capp said.

“For every $1 spent on affordable housing, more than $3 in benefits for our community would be created,” she said.

“Building more affordable housing gives people a safe and stable place to live and provides benefits for our business community.”

Council, community groups join forces

Meanwhile, Frankston City Council, in Melbourne’s southern suburbs, is also tackling homelessness via an alliance of 14 community groups representing housing and homelessness operations, health and legal services and emergency relief providers.

Dr Gillian Kay, Chair of the Frankstown City Strategic Housing and Homelessness Alliance, says homelessness in the City increased by more than 14 per cent between 2011-16 and Frankston was identified in 2017 as a Victorian ‘rough sleeper hot spot’ by a government taskforce.

Dr Kay said while the Big Housing Build was welcome, housing alone wasn’t the solution and the alliance is committed to understanding the causes of homelessness and identifying people at risk.

“Women over 55 are an increasingly vulnerable group,” she said.

Frankston is one of 13 councils from Melbourne’s East and South East who have signed the Regional Local Government Homelessness and Social Housing Charter 2020.

Prof Nyong'o was joined by the Nation Media Group CEO Stephen Gitagama at the unveiling of the ambitious housing plan.

The Governor and Kisumu City Manager Abala Wanga however accused the National Housing Corporation (NHC) of standing in the way of the rollout of affordable housing plans in Kisumu County.

Speaking at the launch event also attended by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary General Mukhisa Kituyi, Prof Nyong'o said such affordable houses are where essential services workers go to sleep when their day's work is done, hence his determination to see it materialise for Kisumu residents.

""It is a human rights issue,"" he said.

Anderson Ofafa affordable housing project will be developed by Laptrust under the county pension fund, in collaboration with the County Government of Kisumu.

The project, to be located along Ngumbi Road in Kisumu, is designed in line with both the national government's and Kisumu county government's affordable housing agenda.

County Pension Fund Group Managing Director Hosea Kili gave a breakdown of the project, which will have about 108 one-bedroom units, which will be sold at an introductory price of Sh1.5 million, exclusively to former residents of the estate, while those from outside will have to purchase at market rates.

The project will see the construction of 714 two-bedroom housing units, which will go for Sh2.5 million each.

There will also be 96 three-bedroom houses going for Sh3.5 million each while special premium two-bedroom and three-bedroom house units will go for Sh3.5 million and Sh4.5 million respectively.

Sixty per cent of the seven-acre parcel of land remains green and will be landscaped for a green experience for residents.

There will also be 92 shops which will be offered to small-scale traders who were living within the estate, and a commercial parking lot that can take up to 1,000 vehicles.

Governor Nyong'o took issue with NHC's opposition to the development of Makasembo affordable housing project over an ownership tussle, saying it is time the traditional housing agency gave way to pensioners to put up affordable houses.

Affordable housing

""The days of NHC are over. Time has come for pensioners to build our own houses,"" he said.

The Kisumu governor said his administration appreciates that housing is an urbanisation challenge.

""To buttress the presidential policy on affordable housing, we have put a number of measures in place. Generally, we have resolved to focus on creating an enabling environment to investors in affordable housing and we will put in place requisite structures to ensure this happens,"" he said.

Mr Gitagama, who was the chief guest at the launch, urged Kisumu residents to take advantage of the upcoming project, promising that NMG will keenly follow up on progress and keep the developers on their toes according to what was promised.

He lauded Governor Nyong'o's effort for low income earners, stating that it will go a long way in changing the landscape of the growing Kisumu economy, which is in line with the Kenya government's grand housing plans.

""The Constitution of Kenya 2010 and the National Development Plan, Vision 2030 Strategy, targeted the provision of 200,000 housing units annually for all income levels. However, the production of housing units is currently at less than 50,000 units annually, well below the target number, culminating in a housing deficit of over 2 million units, with nearly 61 per cent of urban households living in slums,"" he said.

The NMG CEO cited high interest rates on property acquisition and high cost of land, economic uncertainty and government policies that affect demand and prices of property as some bottlenecks in ensuring affordable housing in Kenya.

He also cited socio demographics where most projects undertaken by developers focus on upper middle class and high net worth individuals, locking out average income earners.

""There is a housing crisis and an overwhelming need for affordable housing and it's critical that people are able to live in a home that they can afford,"" he said.

The NMG CEO noted that financial institutions prefer the salaried formal sector, to the disadvantage of the informal sector individuals.

""Financing has also been made harder as institutions prefer to finance projects that they have been involved in throughout the project, ignoring upcoming developers who are embracing low cost methods of construction,"" he said.","Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's ambitious plan for affordable housing has taken off with the launch on Wednesday of 1,200 housing units under the Sh3.8 billion Anderson Ofafa housing project.

That perfect Christmas or New Year present might be waiting for you at the 'Affordable Art Fair' taking place at Eden Space Gallery, on Eden Island, Seychelles.

Organised by Arterial Network Seychelles, the seventh edition of the fair kicked off on Friday and will be open until January 15. Art lovers can purchase paintings, drawings and photography, either as originals or prints. Etching, sculptures and mixed media are also on sale.

Around 30 artists - ranging from established artists to amateur photographers and students from the Seychelles Institute of Art and Design (SIAD) - who live and work in Seychelles are showcasing and selling their work.

Members of the public can purchase the over 200 pieces of works currently in the gallery from 10.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. from Monday to Friday. On Saturday, the gallery is open between 11.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m.

The maximum sale price of artwork is capped at $377 (SCR8000) so as to keep the artwork affordable. Organisers of the fair say that most of the work is significantly below this price ceiling.

The annual event gives the gallery the opportunity to offer work at a lower price than what they might normally cost and hence artists were encouraged to produce smaller, affordable pieces for rapid sales.

The chairman of the Arterial Network, Martin Kennedy, told SNA that ""the beneficiary, of course, is the client as they are able to pick up some good bargains.

He added that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he and his team were unable to hold an opening or private viewing this year, which ""is a real shame.""

""Vernissage for this particular event is always really well attended. In past years, we have had a considerable percentage of our sales generated on the opening night, but because of the restrictions in place due to COVID, we were not able to do that. We are now relying on people dropping in over the next six weeks or so to see the work and buy some of it,"" said Kennedy.

For the first time this year, the gallery is also curating a craft exhibition. On two Saturdays - December 12 and December 19 - a mini craft fair, which will spill over into the plaza walkway, is going to take place.

""There will be some high-end crafts, which kind of crosses the boundary between fine art and craft that will be part of the affordable art fair show. It will be on display the whole time. People will be able to come and take a table from us and sell their own craft. This gives everybody the opportunity to bring something that they have been making and sell it,"" said Kennedy.

He added that there will be no commission on the sale of the craft as there will be an SCR500 rental for the tables.

Arterial Network Seychelles, launched in November 2011, aims at supporting and developing art in Seychelles, an archipelago in the western Indian Ocean. It is part of Arterial Network, a Pan-African civil-society network grouping artists, cultural activists, entrepreneurs, enterprises, non-profit organisations, institutions, and donors active in Africa's creative and cultural sectors.","That perfect Christmas or New Year present might be waiting for you at the 'Affordable Art Fair' taking place at Eden Space Gallery, on Eden Island, Seychelles.
