He also provided details on a system-wide strategy for gender equality.

The briefing for UN Member States took place on 16 January 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Opening the briefing, the Secretary-General noted that since he took office in January 2017, several global challenges have intensified: conflicts have deepened and new dangers have emerged; global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at their highest since the Cold War; climate change is moving faster than governments are moving to take action; inequalities are growing; horrific violations of human rights are happening; and nationalism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise.

Guterres highlighted 12 areas of concern where priority action is needed, alongside the empowerment of women everywhere, which he said is a cross-cutting imperative. The 12 areas are:

Promoting a real “new deal” for an equitable globalization, whose benefits are shared with everyone: the Secretary-General urged Member States to respect their financial commitments and to set in place stronger mechanisms that address fiscal evasion and illicit financial flows (IFFs);

Noting that in 2016, for the first time in the last three years, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased and the past five years have been the warmest in history, the Secretary-General called for stepping up climate action and announced that he will hold a climate summit in 2019 to increase momentum;

Taking advantage of global mobility through the adoption of the first Global Compact on Migration;

Taking advantage of advances in technology, while protecting societies from its risks: Guterres noted that the UN will serve as a platform for Member States to come together with the private sector, the scientific community and academia to discuss on how to use the potential and address the risks;

Achieving the peaceful de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;

Deescalating tensions in the Middle East;

Strengthening the UN’s partnership with the African Union (AU);

Pushing back the dangerous tide of nationalism in Europe, and revitalizing mediation initiatives – including the Normandy Format and Trilateral Contact Group on Eastern Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh, the Geneva International Discussions related to Georgia, and the “5+2” process on Transnistria;

Maintaining a strong focus on counter-terrorism: Guterres announced the convening in June 2017 of a Summit of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies to advance multilateral cooperation;

Strengthening UN peace operations: the Secretary-General noted that a detailed plan of action for that purpose is being prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and said that, in February 2018, he will present his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace;

Reversing the large-scale exodus of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, for which the full implementation of the Rakhine Advisory Commission recommendations is vital; and

Overcoming the “false contradiction” between human rights and national sovereignty: Guterres mentioned that the UN stands ready to support states in building their capacities to uphold the rule of law, promote respect for human rights, and eliminate all forms of discrimination.

The Secretary-General noted that his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace to be presented in February will contain “very strong” proposals on strengthening the Peacebuilding Fund. He observed that the AU needs strong support and clear mandates from the UN, and announced that the UN and the AU will sign a framework of agreement on development, aligning the 2030 Agenda and Africa 2063, during the AU Summit taking place at the end of January 2018.

On gender equality, Guterres said his approach rests on three pillars. The first pillar is empowering women and girls. To that end, he noted the September 2017 launch of his roadmap for achieving gender parity at all UN levels, and announced that in 2018 the UN reached full parity in the 44-member UN Senior Management Group. He added that he also mandated an internal task force to review the UN’s spending on gender equality.

The second pillar of his gender equality approach, Guterres said, is preventing sexual exploitation and abuse against women. With this aim, he appointed the UN’s first-ever Victims’ Rights Advocate, who will work closely with Member States and across the UN system. He noted that 82 Member States are part of a Voluntary Compact to prevent these crimes and respond swiftly to allegations.

The third pillar on which Secretary-General’s gender equality approach rests is preventing and addressing sexual harassment. He reiterated his personal commitment to eliminating sexual harassment at the UN, adding that his zero-tolerance approach was recently reaffirmed in a joint letter with staff unions to all UN personnel. He reported that he has set up a task force, led by Jan Beagle of the Department of Management, to review UN policies and capacities to investigate, to ensure accountability, and to look at the support and protection offered to those affected. Guterres said his team is currently working on more detailed measures to simplify the procedures for reporting harassment and raise awareness of the issue throughout the UN.

The Secretary-General added that 2018 will be “a decisive year for reform,” and noted that the repositioning of the UN development system will facilitate better support for Member States in achieving the SDGs.

Countries welcomed a more in-depth definition of “sustaining peace.”

In the ensuing discussion, many countries, including Cuba, Iran and Singapore, stressed the need for the UN to defend and promote multilateralism. Brazil and Cuba noted that reform of the UN peace and security pillar will not be complete without reform of the UN Security Council. Singapore expressed hope that the Secretary-General will act as advocate for an open and fair world trade system. China called for attention to the root causes of the refugee crisis. Guatemala and El Salvador welcomed a more in-depth definition of the “sustaining peace” concept, with El Salvador adding that the concept should include human rights and be addressed under the peace and security pillar.

2,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/fifth-committee-unga-approve-management-reforms/,"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Fifth Committee, UNGA Approve Management Reforms","23 December 2017: The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) concluded the main part of its 72nd session, recommending that the UNGA adopt a US$5.397 billion budget for the UN’s work in the 2018-2019 biennium. Overall, 17 draft texts, including with regard to the programme budget implications for the intergovernmental conference on global migration, were forwarded to the UNGA and adopted.

The concluding meeting of the Fifth Committee took place on 23 December 2017, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, followed by the Assembly’s final plenary on 24 December. The budget adopted is 5% less than the final budget approved for the 2016-2017 biennium. The change is due to, among other things, reduced funding for special political missions and a 10% reduction of resources for contractual services, furniture and equipment, consultants, supplies and material, and hospitality.

From the management reforms proposed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the UNGA approved the proposal to change the UN budget cycle from a biennial to an annual budget period on a trial basis, beginning with the programme budget for 2020, pending a final decision at the 77th UNGA session on whether to continue that practice. The Secretary-General’s proposal was aimed at simplifying and streamlining UN’s management. The Assembly also approved financial and staff resources for the newly established Office of Counter-Terrorism and the Office of the Victims’ Rights Advocate.

With regard to other proposals on management reform, the UNGA decided not to expand exceptional budgetary authorities, unforeseen and extraordinary expenses, or the Secretary‑General’s limited budgetary discretion. The Assembly also decided not to alter the current level of commitment authority for additional resources requirements arising from UN Security Council decisions related to the maintenance of international peace and security.

In a meeting with the Fifth Committee on 4 December, Guterres had explained that, without the ability to redeploy resources through expanded budgetary discretion, the UN might not be able to respond to requests from the UNGA or respond within 24 hours to natural disasters. Guterres had also informed Member States that a Change Management team is working on a comprehensive, costed proposal on the proposed management structure to be presented to the Fifth Committee in May 2018.

Upon the closing of the Fifth Committee’s work on 23 December, UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said governments had taken “crucial” decisions for the UN’s functioning, including on management reform, by “approving the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to make the UN more effective, accountable and efficient.”

On the migration conference, at the plenary meeting on 24 December governments adopted the resolution on the ‘Modalities for the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration’ (document A/72/L.9). By this resolution, the Assembly: decides to hold the Conference in Morocco, from 10-11 December 2018; reaffirms that the Conference will result in the adoption of an intergovernmentally negotiated and agreed outcome, titled ‘Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,’ with the scope defined by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants; and sets out the format for the Conference, including eight consecutive plenary meetings and two dialogues held in parallel with the plenary meetings. Commenting on the decision, El Salvador said it would have preferred the Conference to take place in New York to facilitate participation by all delegations, and countries lacking permanent representation in Morocco must receive trust fund support.

Lajcak closed the plenary session noting that during northern spring 2018, the Fifth Committee will have two resumed sessions “with heavy agendas.” [UN Meeting Summary, Fifth Committee, 23 December] [UNGA President’s Remarks on Fifth Committee Outcome] [UN Meeting Summary, UNGA Plenary, 24 December] [UNGA President’s Remarks at UNGA Closing Plenary] [UN Press Release] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Fifth Committee Meeting, 4 December]","23 December 2017: The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) concluded the main part of its 72nd session, recommending that the UNGA adopt a US$5.397 billion budget for the UN’s work in the 2018-2019 biennium.

3,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-releases-guidance-on-mechanisms-for-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Releases Guidance on Mechanisms for SDG Implementation,"18 December 2017: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) released a guidance note on integration and coordination mechanisms for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The note provides information on how countries have adapted or established institutional and coordination frameworks to implement the Goals, and highlights efforts to promote horizontal and vertical coherence.

The document titled, ‘Institutional and Coordination Mechanisms: Guidance Note on Facilitating Integration and Coherence for SDG Implementation,’ finds that many countries are adapting and expanding institutional frameworks established during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, such as national councils for sustainable development (NCSDs), for SDG implementation. The note recommends that such institutions should be positioned within the office of the president or prime minister to ensure effective coordination, and should include some form of decentralization, whether by ensuring representation of local focal points in the NCSD or through establishing sub-national bodies. An annex to the note shares country experiences from Germany, Indonesia, and Nigeria.

On new mechanisms and structures, the guidance argues that the scope and ambition of the SDGs requires systems that facilitate cross-sectoral action and shared accountability that traverses ministries, agencies, levels of government and stakeholders. The note shares how countries have created inter-ministerial commissions to oversee SDG implementation, established high-level inter-ministerial committees to bring together sectoral working groups, and established inter-sectoral thematic working groups, or requested ministries to identify their SDG-related responsibilities. Country experiences from Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone illustrate how countries have created new institutional frameworks to implement the SDGs.

The note identifies the functions of an inter-ministerial commission for sustainable development. They include: operating as an advisory body on the SDGs; developing or coordinating implementation strategies on the SDGs; engaging with key stakeholders; developing a national monitoring framework and national indicators; reviewing the SDGs and targets; recommending financing measures for SDG implementation; and preparing for regional and global dialogues on SDG implementation.

The guidance also discusses allocation of responsibility among various levels of government, emphasizing that sub-national and local governments are often responsible for implementation. The note recommends governments promote vertical coherence and integration across government levels by creating explicit institutional links between sustainable development strategies and federal and sub-national processes. The note further recommends, inter alia: maintaining two-way communication; including partners from outside government with local expertise; and matching devolved responsibilities with funds and revenue-raising powers.

Additional sections of the guidance note address, inter alia: promoting an integrated cross-sectoral approach, drawing from national institutions to implement climate interventions; addressing challenges related to SDG monitoring and reporting; and engaging stakeholders. The note underscores the role of parliaments in SDG implementation through their legislative, oversight, and budgetary functions. The document elaborates on opportunities for parliaments to ensure no one is left behind, promote gender equality, support the rights of persons with disabilities, and engage youth populations.

The publication concludes with recommendations on questions countries should consider when adapting or establishing institutional frameworks for SDG implementation. These questions focus on: designation of a key institution to oversee SDG implementation; high-level support for the institution; the institution’s mandate to oversee and coordinate SDG implementation; a sustainable development road map or strategy with clear roles and targets; mechanisms to foster horizontal and vertical coordination; stakeholder engagement; access to decision-making and inclusion of marginalized groups; and mechanisms for arbitration of conflicting views. Finally, the note proposes key structural factors that countries should consider when setting up an institutional mechanism for SDG implementation.

UNDP intends for the note to be a living document that will be updated based on feedback and lessons learned from ongoing SDG implementation.

Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman.

The Framework lays out gender-sensitive requirements and guidelines to ensure that gender equality is a core feature of project design, assess gender impacts, and incentive projects that pro-actively address gender gaps. The framework will enable developers to access funding from a growing number of “gender-lens” investors by quantifying and certifying gender impacts based on best practices.

The Framework’s guidelines address key steps and tools to ensure gender equality in project design and implementation, including: consultations; safeguards assessments; gender baseline analysis; and measurement of progress towards goals. It also provides examples of possible gender targets, such as: increasing girls’ school enrollment and graduation rates; increasing income generation opportunities for women and equal pay; or improved access to financial mechanisms for women.

The handbook provides “basic, practical information” on the steps that countries may take when preparing a VNR, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the UN Secretary-General’s proposal of voluntary common reporting guidelines for VNRs, which were updated in December 2017, and are included in the handbook.

VNRs are part of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are presented annually by UN Member States during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). They are intended to track progress in implementing the SDGs and their targets in all countries in an open, inclusive, participatory and transparent manner.

The ‘Handbook for Preparation of Voluntary National Reviews’ includes sections on: how to initiate a review; organization and preparation of the review; multi-stakeholder participation; key building blocks for preparing the review; preparatory workshops and submission of VNRs; presentation of the VNR at the HLPF; and “after the presentation.” It also features country examples, and a VNR preparation checklist outlining actions related to: initial preparation and organization; stakeholder engagement; VNR preparation; and HLPF presentation.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should not be seen as separate from the implementation of the SDGs, but should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals. On organization and preparation of the review, the handbook notes that for most VNR countries, preparation time is very short, and therefore it is advisable to begin the process as early as possible. The handbook recommends drawing up a work plan or roadmap that covers the main deliverables and deadlines for the national preparatory process. Components of the roadmap could include: the coordination structure for the review; costs of the review and possible sources of funding; scope of the VNR; a list of bodies and agencies that will be providing data and information; key stakeholders to engage and methods of engagement; ways to access to high quality, up-to-date, and disaggregated data; and allocating time for technical editing as well as a high-level review of the VNR and its main messages.

On timeline, the handbook notes that VNR countries should submit their main messages (conclusive summary of the VNR) by 18 May 2018. The final reviews should be submitted to DESA by 18 June 2018.

The handbook states that the preparatory process for the VNRs includes global workshops based on countries’ previous experiences in participating in the VNR process. The workshops are organized by DESA, and are designed to facilitate peer learning and interaction. The handbook indicates that a first global workshop seeks to cover key components of the preparatory process, and involves current and former VNR countries. A second global workshop facilitates the sharing of experiences among VNR countries, including lessons learned and challenges encountered. A third global workshop covers final preparatory matters, and engages countries in a discussion of anticipated follow-up to their VNRs. In preparation for the 2018 VNRs, the first workshop took place in Geneva, Switzerland, in December 2017. The second workshop is planned for early March 2018, in Dakar, Senegal, and the third and final one is scheduled for 15 July 2018, in New York, US, according to the handbook.

The handbook “goes beyond” the UN Secretary-General’s proposed guidelines, the authors note. Those voluntary common reporting guidelines, which are included in an annex to the handbook, provide a framework for the VNR reports, while allowing for flexibility. They were first issued in January 2016, as part of the UN Secretary-General’s report on ‘Critical milestones towards coherent, efficient and inclusive follow-up and review at the global level’ (A/70/684), and were updated in December 2017 based on lessons learned from the VNR experiences in 2016 and 2017. The guidelines comprise sections on: follow-up and review guiding principles; structure and content of the VNR report; and making presentations at the HLPF.

The authors of the handbook also highlight other sources may further assist countries in their preparations, such as the synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs prepared by DESA, and the Guidelines to Support Country Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (2017) prepared by the UN Development Group (UNDG).

In 2018, 48 countries will present their VNRs during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF (16-18 July).

The companies are working on this transition with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-registered charity whose mission is to accelerate the shift to a circular economy. The companies that made the pledge are behind many household consumer brands and include: Amcor, Ecover, Evian, L’Oréal, Mars, Marks & Spencer, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, Walmart, and Werner & Mertz. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that the 11 companies making the pledge are responsible for six million tonnes of plastic packaging every year.

The companies announced their pledge at the launch of the WEF Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). The platform is open to companies, organizations, and governments to create innovative partnerships for decoupling economic growth from resource use. Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever, called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

The CEO of Unilever called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

In the lead-up to Davos, Coca-Cola announced its goal of collecting and recycling “the equivalent” of every bottle or can that it sells by 2030. The company has launched its own plan, ‘World Without Waste,’ which focuses on the life cycle of materials used in its packaging. In an op-ed first published on Medium.com, James Quincey, CEO and President, highlighted the company’s efforts towards this goal, including: the introduction of ‘PlantBottle’ in 2009, a container made from up to 30% plant-based materials; cooperation with the plastics industry to promote recycling activities in Mexico; and its sponsorship of coastal clean-up exercises through the NGO Ocean Conservancy.

McDonald’s announced that all its consumer packaging around the world will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources, preferably sources that have a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. In 2017, just 50% of the company’s consumer packaging came from such sources.

The global packaging company Amcor was the first to take the recycling pledge. Ron Delia, CEO, highlighted this as a key step in differentiating the company as a global leader in the packaging industry.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is leading a three-year initiative, the ‘New Plastics Economy,’ which seeks a shift towards the sustainable use of plastics. The Foundation also partners with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and others to promote the circular economy. On 5 December 2017, the organizations organized a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, on the role of the circular economy in the transition towards a pollution-free planet, together with the EU, WEF, Chatham House, and the Institute for Development Studies (IDS). The event discussed global action on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), and highlighted examples of actions and policies for enhancing resource efficiency, discouraging unsustainable consumption patterns, and redirecting investment for a clean and circular economy.

10,https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/study-ranks-jordan-80th-world-5th-region-sdg-index,"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Jordan Times,"Study ranks Jordan 80th in world, 5th in region in SDG index","AMMAN — Jordan has ranked 80th worldwide and 5th in the Arab world in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Dashboards Report recently issued by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which analyses the SDGs performance of a total of 157 countries out of the 193 UN member states.

Released in cooperation with Bertelsmann Stiftung, this year’s edition of the study included additional metrics for the SDGs analysis along with several refinements to the methodology, leaving the results ""not strictly comparable"" with those of prior editions, according to the report.

The Kingdom obtained the best results in its performance on the SDG No. 1: No poverty, which the report considered as achieved based on statistics indicating that no citizen earns less than $1.9 per day.

“The SDG Index is a tool to engage stakeholders around overall progress made on SDGs. There is a strong correlation between poor and crisis affected countries and lower SDG Index rankings. Jordan ranking 5 in the Arab states means there are potential areas for improvement including availability of data for some of the SDGs and strengthening national data systems to monitor and report on progress,”

Sara Ferrer Olivella, country director, Jordan UNDP, told The Jordan Times.

Human rights researcher Sulaiman Sweiss told The Jordan Times that he ""doubts"" the reality of such advance, noting that ""even the official figures show an increase in poverty in the past years, not to mention the last raise on the price of general goods such as bread, which will continue to burden the less privileged.""

Hunger, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, industry innovation and infrastructure, life below water and life on land were the SDGs in which Jordan performed the worst, according to the study.

""Jordan went backwards on the official rankings released by the UN in the past years and I am not optimistic about the performance next year,"" Sweis said, noting that ""we can not advance in the SDGs within the huge gender gap that we are still experiencing, with women accounting only for the 13 per cent of the workforce in Jordan.""

""The SDG Index and Dashboards is aimed at assisting countries to identify priorities for action in order to achieve the 17 SDGs,"" the report said, pointing out that ""the indicators and dashboards should help countries to pinpoint key implementation challenges.""

In this regard, Gender Consultant at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Reem Aslan told The Jordan Times that ""the participation of women in the economy is very low,"" noting ""the need to provide women with a better working environment and a better work-life balance.""

Low wages, sexual harassment at work and the lack of transportation from home to the workplace are some of the issues preventing women from engaging in the labour market, according to the expert.

""When you look at the statistics you don't find women over 50 in the workplace,"" Aslan highlighted, noting that ""the Social Security Law allows women to retire at an early age without warning them about the financial loss that comes with it, and many of them do not even have the chance to work because they start taking care of their parents once their children emancipate.""

""In addition, we don't believe that the government or the employers are aware of the importance and the benefits of having more women in the workforce,"" she continued, noting the presence of studies aimed at raising awareness on the matter.

""However, we are starting to witness a mental shift derived from the work of non-governmental organisations,"" Aslan added, expressing that ""we are lucky to have a few ministers committed with this issue, such as the minister of Social Development or the minister of Education.""

Regarding the regional picture, Algeria topped the Arab world ranking achieving the 64th position worldwide, followed by Tunisia (65th), Morocco (73th) and the UAE (77th).

Lebanon stood close to Jordan achieving the 86th position worldwide, closely followed by Egypt (87th). Bahrain (92nd) and Oman (94th).

When asked about the regional scenario, Sweis highlighted the similarities between the official UN ranking and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network's ranking, noting that ""many countries in the region have improved their situations despite the challenges they are facing, while Jordan remains in a very similar situation when compared to the previous years.""

""The SDGs are not only about the economy and the statistical figures, they are about human rights,"" the researcher added, calling on the government to ""reconsider the policies in this field if they want to see real advances"".","AMMAN — Jordan has ranked 80th worldwide and 5th in the Arab world in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Dashboards Report recently issued by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which analyses the SDGs performance of a total of 157 countries out of the 193 UN member states.

The report assesses LDCs’ economic trends and progress towards selected SDG targets and indicators.

Only five LDCs reached the SDG 8.1 ambition of sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in 2017.

The 2018 report titled, ‘Selected Sustainable Development Trends in the Least Developed Countries,’ was presented to UNCTAD Member States at a meeting of its governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, on 5 February 2018. The assessment finds that LDCs economic growth averaged 5% in 2017, and should reach 5.4% in 2018, which is below SDG target 8.1 on sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the LDCs. According to the report, in 2017, only five LDCs achieved this target: Bangladesh (7.1% GDP growth), Djibouti (7.0% GDP growth), Ethiopia (8.5% GDP growth), Myanmar (7.2% GDP growth) and Nepal (7.5% GDP growth).

The report shows that aid to LDCs remains far below the target of 0.15-0.20% of donor countries’ official development assistance (ODA)/gross national income (GNI), a level that was agreed in 1981 and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development in 2015. It notes that in 2016, only a handful of donor countries appear to have met these commitments: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK provided over 0.20% of their own GNI to LDCs, while the Netherlands met the 0.15% threshold.

The report also shows that aid tends to be skewed towards a relatively small pool of LDCs, with the top ten recipients accounting for roughly half of total disbursements to the group. The top recipients are often the countries most affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict, the authors find.

The assessment indicates that levels of external indebtedness have been surging across LDCs, and in 2016, remittances accounted for as much as 31% of GDP in Nepal, 29% in Haiti, 26% in Liberia, 22% in the Gambia, 21% in the Comoros, 15% in Lesotho, and they exceeded 10% of GDP in Senegal, Yemen and Tuvalu. It also finds that many LDCs fall short of the inclusive and sustainable industrialization envisaged in SDG target 9.2 (Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in LDCs).

Comprehensive and updated economic and social statistical data on the LDCs can be accessed in UNCTAD’s ‘Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries – 2017.’ [Publication: Selected Sustainable Development Trends in The Least Developed Countries] [UNCTAD Press Release on Report] [UN Press Release on Report] [UNCTAD’s Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries 2017]","8 February 2018: A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) suggests that the least developed countries (LDCs) will not reach the SDGs unless key action is taken, including speeding up wholesale restructuring of their economies.

12,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/csocd-addresses-inequality-of-vulnerable-populations/,"Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,CSocD Addresses Inequality of Vulnerable Populations,"30 January 2018: The 56th session of the Commission for Social Development (CSocD 56) called for efforts to accelerate inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development to ensure that no one is left behind. It also supported a focus on helping vulnerable groups to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Commission agreed on four draft resolutions, which will be forwarded to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

CSocD 56 convened from 29 January-7 February 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Commission focused on the theme, ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all’ and addressed both the drivers of poverty and recommendations to tackle poverty.

In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed welcomed achievements in reducing extreme poverty, providing access to health care and education and promoting the empowerment of women, youth, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and older persons. She cautioned, however, that progress on extreme poverty remains uneven “across regions, within countries and between various social groups.” She underscored the need to address such inequality and unemployment and underemployment among the world’s youth.

On poverty, the Commission discussed the role of strategies for poverty eradication in achieving sustainable development for all. Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions “remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.” Equatorial Guinea for the African Group said 390 million Africans remain “mired in extreme poverty,” despite commitments to eradicate poverty. Participants recognized the role of natural disasters, conflicts, civil unrest and economic slow-downs in driving poverty.

On social protection, many supported both universal health care (UHC) and social services for all. Mohammed said 45% of the people around the world who need social protection have access to only one benefit. She called for social policies and protection that ensure everyone shares the benefits of economic growth and globalization.

Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, observed that many people remain at risk of falling back into poverty if impacted by a disaster, illness, job loss or lack of social protection. He recommended developing a comprehensive and integrated socioeconomic policy framework. A representative from Malawi shared his country’s cash transfer programme and holistic approach to implementing the SDGs.

On vulnerable populations, participants advocated for prioritizing the rights of older persons, youth, rural people and others in special situations. The International Federation of Associations of the Elderly said elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of disasters and impacts from conflicts and wars, and recommended managing older populations’ post-traumatic stress from such crises. The International Relations Students’ Association of McGill University, Canada, the only student‑run group that has consultative status with ECOSOC, called for taking youth voices into account in decisions on environmental change, energy, food security and migration.

Many participants echoed this call for the participation of youth in decision-making, stressing that youth can help to advance the 2030 Agenda and play a role in improving the use of science, technology and innovation (STI) and increasing transparency. Others highlighted: the importance of investments in early childhood education; the role of risk management and insurance in building resilience, especially in the context of climate change and natural disasters; and the potential of access to information and communications technology (ICT) in increasing the independence of persons with disabilities or older persons with mobility challenges.

On UN reform, Mohammed observed that the Commission can support the UN Secretary-General’s current efforts to reposition the UN development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. She said the Commission’s resolution on its methods of work can support these efforts, and emphasized the Commission’s continued role as a space for policy debate and exchange of experiences.

CSocD 56 agreed on a draft resolution on the Commission’s future organization and methods of work. By the text, governments decide that the Commission will focus on a single priority theme at each future session, leading to an action-oriented resolution with recommendations to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The resolution proposes the 2019 priority theme of ‘Addressing inequalities and challenges to social inclusion through fiscal, wage and social protection policies.’

The resolution titled, ‘Third review and appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002′ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.3), recognizes the contribution of older persons to implementing the SDGs, and encourages States to consider the health, care and well-being of older persons in their national SDG implementation. The Commission further agreed on resolutions on: ‘Social dimensions of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.4); and ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all.’

Four high-level panel discussions convened throughout CSocD 56, including a high-level panel that discussed evidence-based mainstreaming of disability in the 2030 Agenda. Another high-level panel focused on the UN Secretary-General’s report on the Madrid review on aging. The report identifies trends and obstacles to implementation of the Plan around the world. Other panel discussions addressed sustainable and resilient societies, including the role of technology for social need and social good, and of innovative ICT in the 2030 Agenda. The Commission also discussed a report on poverty eradication, reviewing progress on and discussing country strategies to implement SDG 1 (no poverty).

ECOSOC President Marie Chatardová noted that the Commission’s discussions on eradicating poverty will contribute to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

He commended the more than 330 companies that have already committed to align their strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through the Science Based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that helps companies determine how much they must cut emissions to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Almost 900 more companies have announced their intent to set science-based targets within the next two years in their CDP disclosures, indicating a “new normal” in the way businesses are developing future strategies, according to the We Mean Business Coalition.

Mahindra said that businesses can “future-proof growth” and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting science-based targets, which also shows governments that businesses are serious about aligning their strategies with the Paris Agreement.

This call, made during the 48th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, which convened from 23-26 January 2018, is the first of multiple ‘Summit Challenges,’ which are expected in advance of the GCAS. Such challenges aim to help deliver GHG reductions to help ensure global emissions start “trending downward” no later than 2020, as well as to help the Summit contribute to an energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth. The GCAS aims to showcase such climate action and new commitment in advance of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 24) in November 2018.

In his statement, Mahindra also sought to dispel the idea a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing profits, among other “persistent myths” about business action on climate change. He explained that initiatives to reduce emissions have generated a return, and in the last five years, his company has saved 58 million KWh of energy, which could power 15,000 homes in India. He added that climate change represents a US$6 trillion financial opportunity over the next two decades.

Also at the WEF, French President Emmanuel Macron committed to shutting down France’s coal-fired power stations by 2021. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted climate change as one of the three most significant challenges to civilization, along with terrorism and the backlash against globalization. The Climate Group released the ‘RE100 Progress and Insights Report: Approaching a Tipping Point: How corporate users are redefining global electricity markets,’ which notes that 25 members of RE100 reached 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2016. Over 30 companies across 16 sectors and with a combined revenue of US$1.3 trillion will accelerate implementation of circular economy solutions through Factor 10, an initiative of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

Hawai’i will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge.

The Hawai’i State Senate aims to focus on a local platform to implement the SDGs during the 2018 Legislative Session. The 2018 Senate Legislative Program outlines Hawai’i’s goals for each of the 17 SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the Program states that Hawai’i will ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have “equal rights to economic resources by implementing and enacting appropriate measures and social protection systems.” On SDG 14 (life below water), Hawai’i will continue its commitment to strengthen its “resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters” in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change. On SDG 15 (life on land), Hawai’i aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of its “’āina and natural resources by integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into local and state planning.”

The Senate will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge, a local sustainability framework that aims to improve the quality of life for future generations. The Aloha+ Challenge focuses on achieving sustainability goals in clean energy, local food production, natural resource management, solid waste reduction, smart and sustainable communities, and green workforce and education. The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard tracks Hawai’i’s progress in these areas. On natural resource management, the Dashboard focuses on increased freshwater capacity, watershed area, marine managed areas, invasive species control and native species management and notes whether each area is being measured or is near its target. For example, on watershed area, Hawai’i is near the 2030 target of 253,000 areas of native watershed under high-level protection. The state has increased is protection of priority watersheds from 10% (90,000 acres) to 15% (132,000 acres) since 2011, and has plans for tripling the areas protected. For each of these areas, the Dashboard provides information on how users can learn more about the issue and contribute to making a difference.

On local food production and consumption, the Dashboard describes current challenges Hawai’i faces in developing a sustainable local food system and outlines the state’s goal of doubling local food production by 2030 by building on Hawai’i’s history of agricultural innovation and abundance. Users can track progress by dairy, protein, vegetables, fruit and starches.

J. Kalani English, Hawaiian Senate Majority Leader, said the 17 SDGs will “continue to build a more resilient state and improve the quality of life for future generations.” In the introduction to the legislative program, he stresses that Hawai’i is recognized as a “global leader in addressing sustainability and climate change challenges, building on a history of systems-thinking and traditional knowledge.” [Hawai’i Senate Press Release] [Hawai’i 2018 Senate Legislative Program] [Aloha+ Challenge]","17 January 2018: The Hawai’i State Senate announced its intention to enact the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into state law to achieve the sustainability of Hawai’i’s people, communities, natural resources and economic prosperity.

It notes that these projects have yielded valuable lessons on innovation to tackle inequities, and illustrate ways to overcome common challenges faced by eHealth programs, including with regard to gender inequality and women’s empowerment.

Titled ‘Overcoming eHealth challenges with social and technical innovations,’ the IDRC’s webpage that documents the projects focuses on outcomes and experiences linked to its Strengthening Equity through Applied Research Capacity building in eHealth (SEARCH) initiative. The initiative involved local research teams working closely with community members, health providers, and decision-makers at local and national levels, and explored whether and in which circumstances eHealth and mHealth could “respond to key challenges to deliver quality services to everyone.” In the context of this project, eHealth refers to the use of mobile phones and other digital technologies to improve the health and well-being of populations, while mHealth is used for tools with a strong mobile component.

In Bangladesh, IDRC reports on the development, by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), of a framework for integrating equity, accountability, and system integration considerations in the design, development, and evaluation of eHealth projects. Comprising 10 criteria on strategic vision, participation, transparency, responsiveness, equity, ethics, information governance, rule of law, performance, and sustainability, the framework is meant to ensure that government and eHealth implementers consider equity and accountability in project design.

In Burkina Faso, IDRC indicates that the MOS@N platform, developed locally using open source software, enables access to information about maternal and child healthcare, and living with HIV. Funded by IDRC and carried out in collaboration with the University of Montreal, the MOS@N project is a mobile phone communication system deployed in five health centres serving 26 villages in Burkina Faso. Text and interactive voice messaging systems issue messages in five local languages to ensure inclusiveness and greater accessibility. In addition, MOS@N can use solar recharging systems installed in health centres and provided to community health workers to counter erratic electricity supply.

In Kenya, the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, with the financial support from IDRC, carried out a mapping of the National eHealth Strategy first launched in 2011. The mapping’s findings are being used to: inform the review of the eHealth strategy; formulate the country’s first eHealth policy; and develop standards and guidelines. Guides to standardize hardware and software systems to ensure interoperability and set common standards for mHealth systems are also being prepared, IDRC notes. The 2011 National eHealth Strategy targeted areas including telemedicine, electronic health records, information for citizens, mHealth, and eLearning or distance education to boost health professionals’ knowledge.

In Peru, IDRC indicates that the Minister of Health signed, in January 2017, a ministerial order to implement an innovative eHealth system (WawaRed) throughout the country. Piloted in 15 health centres in the district of Ventanilla to improve maternal and child health, WawaRed should reach 350 centres countrywide, including 20 in the humid lowlands where the Zika virus continues to spread. IDRC states that researchers at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, with the Centre’s support, created an integrated data collection and analysis platform that links the country’s fragmented healthcare system, from local health centres to the central Ministry of Health. It adds that WawaRed is likely to expand to other areas of healthcare, including tuberculosis treatment and tracking HIV and other diseases.

Among other country experiences reported on the webpage, IDRC indicates that a community-based eHealth system (e-Sahha project) developed by the American University of Beirut and funded by IDRC is showing how non communicable diseases (NCDs) care can be effectively delivered to displaced and rural populations. The Centre notes that the eHealth system, tested in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health in rural areas and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Palestinian refugee camps, has increased diabetes and high blood pressure detection, reduced high blood pressure levels, and improved diabetes control. It also states that after one year, patients receiving text messages had improved their control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and many had changed their behaviors based on the messages they received.

IDRC supports research in developing countries to promote growth, reduce poverty, and “drive large-scale positive change.” The Centre is governed by a board of up to 14 governors, whose chairperson reports to Parliament through the Canadian Minister of International Development. Its head office is located in Ottawa, Canada, with four regional offices in Cairo (Egypt), Montevideo (Uruguay), Nairobi (Kenya) and New Delhi (India).

16,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/small-states-emphasize-finance-partnerships/,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Small States Emphasize Finance, Partnerships","7 December 2017: Small States face a “triple trap” of climate impacts, high fossil fuel prices and high levels of indebtedness, according to discussions at the Small States Forum. Forum Chair Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, released the summary of the 2017 Forum.

The annual high-level event took place on 14 October 2017, in Washington, DC, US, during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings. The Forum gathered heads of government, ministers and central bank governors from small States, as well as representatives of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth Secretariat, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the IMF. The 2017 edition of the Forum marked the first time that private sector institutions participated at a large scale, including Swiss Re, World Economic Forum, Bitt.com and the World Ocean Council.

The four main issues raised during the 2017 Small States Forum, according to the summary, are: vulnerability; International Development Association (IDA18) implementation; de-risking; and partnerships. The summary also highlights the importance of mobilizing public and private sector financing for renewable energy, for green and blue economies, and for technology. Also, according to the summary, Forum Members welcomed the ‘Roadmap for World Bank Group Engagement with Small States,’ which was prepared by the World Bank in May 2017.

On vulnerability, participants underlined that small States’ susceptibility to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, frames the challenge of quickly mobilizing and disbursing considerable financial resources to countries that may not have easy access to concessional development finance. The World Bank can mobilize finance quickly in the aftermath of an emergency and provide additional resources for countries that otherwise would not be eligible for it, including by using the IDA Crisis Response Window and creative price buy-downs using trust fund resources. However, the Members noted, some vulnerable small States, such as Nauru and Palau, are unable to access either IDA or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, as they neither qualify for the IDA small States exception nor meet the credit standard for IBRD. They called on the World Bank to explore financing solutions for such vulnerable small States that “fall through the cracks.”

On the IDA18 implementation, participants welcomed the “massive increase” in IDA resources available for eligible small States (US$1.9 billion, which is more than double the previous allocation), noting that for some countries, the IDA allocation has quadrupled. The Forum observed that the challenge is to now find transformative projects that can absorb and make the most of these extra resources. The summary explains the need to focus efforts on preparation, front-loading and fast-tracking (available) development financing, and using innovative financial instruments and creating new partnerships to mobilize additional public and private sector resources.

On de-risking, the Forum noted that as financial institutions seek to “de-risk,” they are causing the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships in small States. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda proposed the establishment of a working group to address the development challenges of de-risking for small States.

Participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and nontraditional partnerships.

On partnerships, participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and non-traditional partnerships. Development partners agreed to continue working together to improve opportunities for small States to access development finance that reduces their vulnerability to shocks.

Several private sector innovative mechanisms were also discussed, including: a new form of blockchain technology that builds direct financial connections to manage remittances and address the challenge of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relations; private insurance that acts as a financial shock absorber, providing fiscal space during natural disasters; and technology to ensure the traceability of tuna so that small States can significantly increase their revenue.

Leaders highlighted the role of political will, community engagement and targeted investment in changing practices and lives, stressing that FGM can and must be stopped.

The Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality (SDG 5) target 5.3 aims to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM by 2030. According to the UN, global prevalence of FGM has declined nearly one-quarter since 2000 but the rate of progress is insufficient to keep up with population growth, meaning that the number of total cases is expected to continue to increase without additional action. In addition, by 2030, one-third of births globally will be in the 30 FGM countries, a trend that will require accelerated progress to protect women and girls from this practice.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.”

In his message for the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.” He called for accelerating progress on SDG target 5.3, saying that, without immediate action, “a further 68 million girls could be subjected to this practice by 2030.” Guterres stressed, “sustainable development cannot be achieved without full respect for the human rights of women and girls.”

In a joint statement for the Day, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Natalaia Kanem described FGM as a “violation of human rights that both reflects and perpetuates the low status of girls and women” and can cause infection, childbirth complications and death. The leaders highlighted building momentum to eliminate FGM, observing that over 25 million people in more than 18,000 communities across 15 countries have disavowed the practice of FGM since 2008. Fore and Kanem stressed that ending the practice helps girls to grow up healthier, better educated and employed, and more empowered to make decisions about their lives.

In countries where UNICEF and UNFPA work jointly to end FGM, the UN finds that girls are one-third less likely to undergo FGM than in 1997. The UNICEF and UNFPA Executive Directors highlighted conditions that help to end FGM, including when governments, communities and families address the issue; when women and girls are empowered to make their voices heard; when villages confront social norms; when access to education, health and legal services support sustainable change; when medical professionals refuse to perform FGM; or when laws make FGM a crime and authorities enforce the law.

According to the UN Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC), many women and girls in European countries are also subjected to FGM, particularly migrants from countries where FGM is practiced. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 20,000 women and girls coming from countries that practice FGM apply for asylum in European member states annually, including for reasons related to FGM. UNRIC explains that FGM continues to exist among migrant groups after migration to Europe, with girls particularly at risk when they temporarily return to their country of origin during holidays.

The Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, said the FGM “is not acceptable in the 21st century” in her remarks at an international forum in the Gambia on strategies to combat FGM. Gambia banned FGM in November 2015. Wickramanayake called on countries to address gaps in their legal frameworks to end the practice of FGM.

Japan announced a US$50 million contribution to the Global Financing Facility (GFF) in support of the Every Woman Every Child initiative. In addition, the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed UHC progress in a new monitoring report.

The Global UHC Forum convened from 12-15 December 2017, in Tokyo, Japan, with participation from Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Anthony Lake, as well as heads of state and ministers from 30 countries. The Forum was convened by the government of Japan and co-sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), UHC2030 (the leading global movement advocating for UHC), UNICEF, the World Bank and WHO.

Aimed at accelerating progress towards SDG target 3.8 on UHC (Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all), the Forum was the culmination of events in over 100 countries. At the close of the Forum, the co-organizers released a commitment to action titled, ‘The Tokyo Declaration on UHC.’ Signatories recognize the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDGs, noting that UHC contributes to progress towards all SDGs. Reiterating the importance of target 3.8, the Declaration says action must include preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services, as well as safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines.

The Declaration also reinforces the principle of Leaving No One Behind, which it says requires special effort, in order to design and deliver health services informed by the voices and needs of people, while prioritizing the most vulnerable members of the world’s population, particularly children and women, refugees and migrants, and marginalized, stigmatized and minority populations. The text notes that by 2023, the midpoint towards 2030, the world needs to extend essential health coverage to 1 billion additional people and halve to 50 million the number of people being pushed into extreme poverty by health expenses.

Also through the declaration, the co-organizers of the Forum:

Commit to monitoring progress towards UHC as part of the SDG review process by issuing global monitoring reports regularly, and reviewing key findings both at the subsequent UHC Forum and in the context of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and the UN General Assembly (UNGA);

Commit to jointly mobilizing political leadership around the world so that countries develop their own roadmaps towards UHC, with clearly indicated targets, indicators and specific plans; and

Call for expanded financing and increased alignment to support UHC by all development partners, particularly multilateral development banks and Global Health Initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

During the Forum, the Government of Japan announced a US$50 million contribution to GFF, which is a country-led model of development finance that brings together multiple sources of financing to support countries’ priorities. Contributions to the GFF Trust Fund will help countries close the financing gap for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition, accelerate progress on UHC, and reach the SDGs by 2030. The World Bank and the UN launched the GFF at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, in Addis Ababa in July 2015, in support of Every Woman Every Child, and as part of the efforts to finance the SDGs.

Each year, large numbers of households are pushed into poverty by health care costs.

Also during the Global UHC Forum, the World Bank and the WHO launched a report titled, ‘Tracking UHC: 2017 Global Monitoring Report,’ which shows that at least half of the world’s population cannot obtain essential health services. In positive progress, the 21st century has seen an increase in the number of people able to obtain some key health services, such as immunization and family planning, as well as antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV and insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria. In addition, the publication reflects, fewer people are now being tipped into extreme poverty than at the turn of the century. However, the publication notes, there are wide gaps in the availability of services in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Moreover, in Eastern Asia, Latin America and Europe, a growing number of people are spending at least 10% of their household budgets on out-of-pocket health expenses. Each year large numbers of households are pushed into poverty because they must pay for health care out of their own pockets.

In December 2017, the UNGA officially proclaimed 12 December as International UHC Day to raise awareness of the need for strong and resilient health systems that leave no one behind. UNGA will hold a high-level meeting on UHC in 2019.

19,https://www.edie.net/library/Five-steps-to-take-the-lead-on-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals/6807,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",edie.net,SDG roundtable: Five ways to move from ambition to action,"Sustainability and corporate responsibility managers from a range of businesses across the country recently gathered in London for an exclusive roundtable hosted by edie and UL EHS Sustainability, which explored the steps required to take the lead on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

George Ogleby","So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs?
Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week.
Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action.
Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned.
Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda."
20,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-report-links-wealth-to-natural-resource-management/,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Report Links Wealth to Natural Resource Management,"30 January 2018: The World Bank’s third volume on wealth accounting underscores the role of a portfolio of produced, natural and human capital assets in sustaining long-term development. The report finds that natural capital accounts for nearly half of the wealth in low-income countries, and argues that natural resources management is critical to long-term sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018,’ estimates the wealth of 141 countries between 1995 and 2014 by aggregating: produced capital (buildings, infrastructure, urban land); human capital (earnings over a person’s lifetime); natural capital (agricultural land, forests, fossil fuels, minerals and terrestrial protected areas); and net foreign assets (foreign assets minus liabilities). The report aims to help governments plan for a more sustainable economic growth path.

According to the report, middle-income countries (MICs) are closing the wealth gap with high-income countries, holding 28% of global wealth in 2014, compared to 19% in 1995. Over 20 low-income countries have moved to MIC status by investing in natural resources, education and infrastructure. Despite this progress, the report cautions that inequality persists, with high-income Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries possessing more than 52 times more wealth per capita than low-income countries.

In 25 countries, per capita wealth declined or stagnated, which suggests that their assets for generating future income may be depleted. These countries include a few high-income OECD countries affected by the 2009 financial crisis, some carbon-rich countries in the Middle East and several large low-income countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, wealth per capita has not changed significantly since 1995.

The report finds that human capital makes up about 70% of the wealth in high-income countries compared to 40% in low-income countries. Within this context, the report underscores the importance of investing in people to boost economic growth and wealth.

Low-income countries could increase their wealth through sustainable land management and increasing forests and other renewable resources.

On natural capital, the report finds that natural capital is the largest share of wealth for low-income countries, primarily because of their agricultural land and forests. Natural capital accounts for over 50% of the wealth in ten of 24 low-income countries, which the report suggests highlights the need to manage natural capital to increase its value for future generations. The report recommends low-income countries increase their wealth through sustainable land management and increasing their renewable resources, including forests. The report further suggests that countries can use rents from non-renewable resources, like fossil fuels and minerals, to build infrastructure and human capital assets that will generate income after these resources are exhausted.

Karin Kemper, World Bank, explained that the report’s research shows that the value of natural capital per person “tends to rise with income,” which “contradicts traditional wisdom” that development entails depleting natural resources. The research shows that depletion of natural resources, like forests and fisheries, only results in short-term growth.

The report does not include fish stocks, water, renewable energy resources and several ecosystem services in its estimates of natural capital because of a lack of data. The World Bank aims to fill this gap in future work on natural capital. In addition, the World Bank is conducting two follow-up studies on human capital: one on the cost of gender inequality; and a second report that will explore the benefits of human capital data on investing in education, reducing stunting and ending child marriage.

The World Bank published two earlier reports on wealth as an indicator of sustainability, in 2006 and 2011. The 2018 volume is the first to include estimates of human capital.

In a blog post, UNDP Indonesia shares nine characteristics that are key to its Country Platform’s potential success.

The UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 envisions the role of Country Support Platforms as helping countries design and deliver integrated SDG solutions, with variation among platforms according to the country context. The platforms respond to increased demand for collaboration among a wider range of actors.

UNDP Indonesia presents the SDGs as “the trillion-dollar investment opportunity that they are” rather than focusing on potential funding shortfalls. According to UNDP Indonesia, 79% of Indonesians donated money in the past month, making Indonesia the second most generous country in the world. Islamic law mandates that all Muslims who are eligible donate at least 2.5% of their income or accumulated wealth to the poor and needy, a practice known as Zakat. UNDP Indonesia calculated that, if every eligible Muslim pays US$74 annually, the country could generate US$16 billion, an amount that “represents a huge potential to support the SDGs.”

The nine key characteristics of Indonesia’s Country Platform are:

A collaborative space: The Platform involves the UN, the Government of Indonesia, private sector and civil society, both in Indonesia and globally, in developing solutions to achieve the SDGs;

Focus on partnerships: UNDP Indonesia has invited a wide range of actors to participate in the Platform, including to set the agenda, provide funding, second staff and become investment partners;

Pilot and scale innovation: The Platform has tested new solutions with the aim of replicating solutions within and across countries and advises large-scale investments on inclusivity and sustainability;

A networked Platform: The Platform is composed of a horizontal network of platforms that are linked with other countries to facilitate South-South cooperation;

Focus on SDG financing: The Platform is focused on designing financing instruments, informing investments and developing and advising partners on policy and knowledge sharing, an approach aimed at responding to demand and producing results;

Maximum innovation: The Platform has “one foot inside and one foot outside the government,” a position that allows the Platform freedom to innovate and leverage change;

Capacity-building: The Platform utilizes skills like Islamic finance and private investment, SDG impact measurement, systems thinking and design and technological solutions;

Sustainable: The Platform’s business model relies on a combination of grants and service fees, with the aim of increasing fees over time; and

Integrated: UNDP serves as an integrator in the Platform by facilitating a system-wide approach to the SDGs, bringing together partners and providing a space for innovation.

The partnership between BAZNAS, the state zakat agency, and UNDP Indonesia is the first time a Zakat organization has committed to supporting the SDGs. Zainulbahar Noor, BAZNAS, said that the agency’s conversations with UNDP helped BAZNAS to realize that “when you are talking about SDGs, you are talking about zakat.” Noor said UNDP and BAZNAS are collaborating on zakat inclusion, explaining that when the agency collects zakat through branchless banking, it can use the funds to support the SDGs.

The study – entitled How to report on the SDGs: What good looks like and why it matters – reviews corporate reporting on the SDGs from the world’s largest 250 companies (G250) and assesses it against nine SDG reporting quality criteria.

KPMG’s research finds that within two years of the SDGs being launched in 2015, four in ten (40 percent) top companies acknowledged the global goals in their corporate reporting. Of these, 84 percent identified the SDGs they consider most relevant to their business.

However, less than one in ten has reported a business case for action on the SDGs (8 percent) or has set specific and measurable (SMART) business performance targets related to the global goals (only 10 percent).

Adrian King, a lead author of the study and KPMG’s Global Lead for Sustainability Reporting & Assurance, said:

“There are huge business opportunities inherent in tackling the world’s toughest problems, but so far only a handful of big companies have shown they understand that. These few leaders stand to benefit from recognizing the SDGs as a powerful catalyst for the innovation, partnerships and market transformations that build businesses. They will also be at an advantage when communicating with the many investors, governments and other stakeholders who are taking an increasing interest in the contribution of business to the SDGs.”

Key findings from KPMG’s study include:

The SDGs most commonly prioritized by leading companies are Climate Action (SDG13), Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG8) and Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG3)

The SDGs least commonly prioritized are Life on Land (SDG15), Zero Hunger (SDG2) and Life Below Water (SDG14)

Three quarters (75 percent) of companies that report on the SDGs discuss the impact their business has on the goals, but reporting is largely unbalanced with most companies discussing their positive impacts but not the negative

Four in ten (39 percent) companies that report on the SDGs include the global goals in their CEO and or Chair’s message

23,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-blended-finance-and-private-sector-contributions-to-the-sdgs/,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Blended Finance and Private Sector Contributions to the SDGs,"How will we finance sustainable development? In last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, we saw the possibilities that blockchain technology holds for development finance. This week’s brief considers where and how private sector actors can contribute to SDG achievement, including through blended finance.

Blended finance is the use of public or philanthropic investment to attract commercial finance from the private sector, particularly to fund activities in developing countries. The private sector contains many types of entities: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), multinational corporations (MNCs), institutional investors, individuals, and everything in between. A working paper by Convergence and the Business & Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Task Force tackles a subset of the question posed in its title, ‘Who is the private sector?’ The paper focuses on six types of institutional investors: pension funds; insurance companies; sovereign wealth funds; commercial and investment banks; private equity firms; and asset/wealth managers. The authors then consider how to mobilize capital from such institutional investors, through blended finance. Recommendations address: 1) engagement, 2) designing appropriate products and scaling successful solutions, 3) building off development finance institutions (DFIs) capabilities and experience, and 4) disseminating return and impact data.

Also from the Blended Finance Task Force, in partnership with the Business & Sustainable Development Commission and SYSTEMIQ, comes ‘Better Finance, Better World.’ This consultation paper says that institutional investors can leverage the current low-interest rate environment to use blended finance in a manner that de-risks investment in emerging markets infrastructure. The paper also notes the central role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and DFIs, but calls on both to increase their mobilization ratios. The paper highlights that MDBs currently mobilize less than US$1 of private capital per dollar invested. A write-up of the two papers on ImpactAlpha by Convergence’s Justice Durland looks at “ways to get the private sector to start paying attention” to the SDGs. Coverage of the second paper is also available on Public Finance International.

Eurodad’s Polly Meeks authored a piece, also on Public Finance International, asking whether blended finance is “a silver bullet or a double-edged sword” and noting the opportunity costs of blended finance. The article responds to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) ‘Private Finance for Sustainable Development’ conference, hosted on 29 January 2018, in Paris, France. The event, covered by Devex’s Molly Anders, launched an OECD report titled, ‘Making Blended Finance Work for the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The report notes blended finance’s potential for delivering the US$2.5 trillion annual investment needed to achieve the SDGs. It highlights that donor governments and other development actors are increasingly using blended finance, but acknowledges that “a critical first step” is simply agreeing on a common definition.

Lastly on blended finance, the Brookings Institution’s Emily Gustafsson-Wright asks, ‘Is paying for results with blended finance ready to take off?’ The post, featured on Brookings’ Education Plus Development blog, quotes Davos attendees’ remarks on the potential for innovative financing models, and evaluates the extent to which blended finance has been used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. Gustafsson-Wright looks at a range of case studies, including payment by results, social and development impact bonds, and other efforts by bilateral and multilateral donors. She concludes that there is indeed something to be said for blended finance, whose elements can enable more effective investment in prevention, incentivize collaboration, build a culture of monitoring and evaluation, and empower countries to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

The SDGs can serve as an investment tool for “putting value on values.”

Blended finance is not the only way for the private sector to support the SDGs. Thomson Reuters delves into other roles for private companies in article titled, ‘Can you use the SDGs as an investment tool?’ The post discusses opportunities to use environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics as a basis to develop investment strategies in manner that is consistent with, or centered around, the SDGs. The piece references a prior webinar and summary report on how the SDGs can serve as “a new tool for putting value on values.”

GreenBiz Group’s Anya Khalamayzer also looks at ESG opportunities aligned with the SDGs, through the lens of retirement and pension funds. The post highlights an aspirational goal by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to move US$10 billion in retirement assets under management of its member companies into ESG-themed retirement benefit accounts by 2020. Last week, together with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), WBCSD also launched draft guidance on applying Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ESG-related risks.

Private sector engagement with the SDGs featured broadly at GreenBiz 18, GreenBiz Group’s annual conference, which convened from 6-8 February 2018, in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions on Materiality and Metrics discussed three types of contributions to the 2030 Agenda: “the potential of business to realize the SDGs;” navigating the reporting landscape; and SDG achievement through improved soil health. A WBCSD-moderated GreenBiz tutorial highlights what businesses can do with respect to the SDGs, covering employment opportunities, technological innovation, and, as discussed above, finance.

Also on measuring business contributions, the SDG Compass has been updated with new indicators, according to the Global Reporting Initiative. SDG Compass is a joint product of GRI, WBCSD and UN Global Compact that provides guidance to companies on aligning strategies and measuring contributions to the SDGs.

A UBS white paper titled, ‘Partnerships for the Goals,’ explores opportunities for wealth managers to collaborate with MDBs, financial services firms, UBS’s clientele, and social enterprises, in order to mobilize the estimated US$5-7 trillion of annual investment needed to meet the SDGs. The paper calls on wealth managers to take action in five areas: 1) working more closely with MDBs, 2) standardizing sustainable and impact investing conventions, 3) working together to “fashion new solutions that fill gaps in the SDG-funding instrument landscape,” 4) focusing on outcomes and impacts, in partnership with philanthropic clients, and 5) working with social entrepreneurs and introducing them to their stakeholders.

An upcoming SDG Knowledge Weekly brief will explore the role of public finance in making the SDGs a reality, as the international community gears up for meetings on tax collaboration, infrastructure, and follow-up to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FFD.

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) issued a report titled, ‘Climate change, migration and displacement: The need for a risk-informed and coherent approach,’ addressing the challenges of linking human mobility to climate change.
Although both migration and climate change are addressed in the SDGs, within the SDGs, there are very few connections between migration and a range of development areas.
The report explains that although both migration and climate change are addressed in the SDGs, within the SDGs, there are very few connections between migration and a range of development areas, including climate change.
While SDG 13 focuses exclusively on climate change, SDGs 8, 10 and 17 (partnership for the Goals) point to the need for facilitated, planned and well-managed migration policies, but do not make the connection with climate change."

The ninth meeting of the negotiating committee of the regional agreement on access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in LAC convened in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 28 February to 4 March 2018, to conclude negotiations of the agreement, which enshrines the protection of human rights defenders in environmental matters.

During the closing ceremony, Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís said the agreement will help fight crime, poverty, inequality and hate, and is crucial “for the very survival of our species.” He pointed to “environmental democracy” as a new legal term that implies the participation of all in protecting the environment.

Alicia Bárcena, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said the agreement ensures the right of people to participate in decisions that affect their lives and surroundings. She explained that the “second-generation accord” links the environment to human rights and rights of access, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

During the meeting, signatory countries invited all LAC countries to sign and ratify the agreement as soon as possible. The agreement will be open to the signature of the 33 LAC countries at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from September 27, 2018 to September 26, 2020. The agreement establishes the creation of a Conference of the Parties (COP), which ECLAC, serving as technical secretariat of the agreement, will convene no later than one year after the agreement enters into force and which will hold ordinary meetings at regular intervals, in accordance with what the Conference decides.

Speaking during the meeting, Miguel Ángel González, Chile, stressed that any decision made by an authority overseeing environmental matters must include a participatory analysis of what that decision means on the ground and for the populations involved. UNEP LAC Office Director Leo Heileman said the agreement provides the opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level.

Also during the meeting, ECLAC released the publication, ‘Access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean: Towards achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ which reviews the laws and institutional frameworks that safeguard the rights of access to information, participation and access to justice in environmental matters in the 33 LAC countries. The publication draws on material compiled by the Observatory on Principle 10 in LAC, which analyzes legislation, policies, jurisprudence and treaties that guarantee the rights enshrined in Principle 10. The updated version of the publication, which was first published in 2013, reflects recent developments and the traction they have gained in the LAC region, and includes new examples of good practices and emerging issues.

The Forum outlined its commitment to eliminate gender gaps in the workplace in the ‘Call to Action of Chile.’

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Chile organized the Forum in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women. The event, which convened in Santiago, Chile, from 27-28 February 2018, focused on the theme ‘The Future of Work and the 2030 Agenda.’ Over 500 representatives from 39 countries, including more than 50 employers’ organizations and trade unions, attended the event.

The Forum addressed gender gaps in the workplace within the context of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). SDG 5 includes target 5.1, to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, and target 5.5, to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making. SDG target 8.5 aims to, by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value.

Participants shared progress and challenges related to achieving these SDG targets. The Gambia’s Vice President and Minister of Women’s Affairs, Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, reported that empowering women and enabling equal opportunities in the workforce is “a key pillar of our National Development Plan.” Jallow-Tambajang emphasized that businesses, from micro-credit and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, are taking steps to reduce inequalities, boost productivity and improve the Gambia’s economies.

Achieving equality in the labor force will require addressing women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work.

Richard Barathe, UNDP, observed that women’s equality in the labor force could contribute US$28 trillion to the global economy by 2025. But, he noted, this will require efforts to address women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, encourage women’s entry into the workforce and close the gender pay gap.

In the Call to Action of Chile, governments, the private sector and union members commit to “work every day” to promote equality and inclusion and to change working conditions to achieve greater equality between women and men. The signatories call on stakeholders to find innovative ways to apply lessons learned and to share the Forum’s messages on gender equity in their workplace and with other companies.

The Forum also discussed UNDP’s ‘Gender Equality Seal’ programme, which certifies companies that have eliminated pay gaps, increased the number of women in decision-making roles and made progress in ending sexual harassment in the workplace. UNDP supports partners in 17 countries around the world to meet gender equality targets.

The Forum’s website features a catalogue of solutions to accelerate gender equality. Solutions are organized around solutions to: eliminate the gender pay gap; promote labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors; build transformative partnerships; eradicate sexual harassment; promote women in business; foster women in leadership; and promote work-life balance.

On promoting labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors, UNDP describes a project that promoted the integration of women and girls in workplaces in Haryana, India, including a training program for women in the stainless steel sector. As a result, jobs opened in a sector that has not traditionally been an option for women in India. UNDP stresses that programmes focused on women “need not use a welfare approach” but can instead use a gender and development lens to focus on sustainable impact.

29,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/reports-launched-on-iwd2018-assess-progress-on-womens-land-rights/,"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Reports Launched on IWD2018 Assess Progress on Women’s Land Rights,"13 March 2018: The need to guarantee women’s access to and ownership of land, property and other economic assets are incorporated into several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including: SDG 5 (gender equality) target 7; SDG 1 (no poverty) target 3; and SDG 2 (zero hunger) target 3. Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

A recent audit of land ownership by the Kenya Land Alliance that was guided by gender parity objectives set out in Kenya’s constitution, the SDGs and various African Union (AU) targets, including the AU Declaration of Land Issues and Challenges in Africa and related target of achieving 30% of documented land rights for women by 2025, found that despite the adoption of Kenya’s progressive new constitution in 2010, women’s land ownership lags far behind that of men. The audit analyzed about one-third of the 3.2 million title deeds issued since 2013 and found that women hold roughly 10% of land titles issued in the last five years. An even greater gender disparity was found in terms of actual land size, with women getting only 1.62% of more than 10 million hectares of land titled during this period.

Discussing the need to build the evidence base on how best to strengthen women’s land rights in Africa and globally, a post on the World Bank’s Voices blog makes a case for more “nuanced data collection.” The blog references a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), titled, ‘Women’s land rights as a pathway to poverty reduction: A framework and review of available evidence,’ which argues that despite the large body of literature on the relationship between land tenure security, livelihoods, and poverty, most of this literature is based on household-level data and does not consider possible intra-household inequalities in land ownership. It mentions ongoing efforts at the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) to develop standard methods for measuring perceived tenure security, for example on the differing perceptions of women and men about their risk of land confiscation, or the experiences of women within male-headed households. Among some examples of possible policy measures that build on a more “nuanced” approach to land data, the blog highlights efforts to incentivize joint registration of land held by married couples in Uganda, and a project in Benin to demarcate village boundaries and certify farm plots.

Another UN-HABITAT report published on the Land Portal titled, ‘Women and Land in the Muslim World: Pathways to increase access to land for the realization of development, peace and human rights,’ notes that while women around the world face similar challenges – including socially prescribed gender roles, unequal power dynamics, discriminatory family practices, and unequal access to justice – the influence of customary and religious practices in countries with a dominant Muslim population create “context-specific opportunities to meet these challenges.” Among some tenure options in these contexts, the report pays special attention to the protection of women’s land rights through inheritance and at the time of marriage, when the land and property regime of the family is redefined. Legal and administrative reforms, access to justice, credit and microfinance are presented as important conditions for change, with emphasis on the protection of displaced women’s land and housing rights.

One example of how programmes are working in an innovative way in a Muslim setting is the use of community radio to raise women’s awareness of their land and property rights in the predominantly Somali-speaking Garissa County of northern Kenya. An article published on the Land Portal narrates an exchange among women members of a radio listening club following the airing of a specially-packaged radio programme, which includes drama series, radio features, call-in sessions and a segment explaining relevant clauses within the Kenyan constitution.

Some listeners recount how they lost everything after undergoing divorce, while others highlight the struggles they have gone through to get ownership of their land, livestock and property, and the abuse they have received as a result. The article notes that as a result of the awareness created, mass applications received by the Garissa land registry office from women wanting to transfer land into their names. The overall impact on women’s economic empowerment is further highlighted by the success of the Sankuri Women Milk Hawking Cooperative Society, which was established in 2011 by activists, divorcees, widows and other village women who had faced cultural injustices. The article highlights the change in women’s social status, with one woman joking that men now inquire if women are divorced “so that they can marry us and be part of our prosperity.” [Kenya Land Alliance Website] [World Bank Voices Blog Post on Women’s Land Rights] [Publication: Women’s Land Rights as a Pathway to Poverty Reduction: A Framework and Review of Available Evidence] [Publication: Women and Land in the Muslim World] [Land Portal Story on “Land Rights FM”] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on International Women’s Day 2018]","Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

30,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-renewable-energy-and-linkages-across-sdgs/,"Mon, 05 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Renewable Energy and Linkages Across SDGs,"This SDG Knowledge Weekly follows energy-related events in Bangkok and Geneva, as governments and stakeholders begin preparing for the review of SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) at this year’s session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). As energy is a ‘nexus issue’ that spans the breadth of the SDGs, our attention was also drawn to knowledge products that directly link energy to decent jobs (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

The Global Preparatory Meeting for Review of SDG 7 took place from 21-23 February, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Thai Ministry of Energy. The meeting highlighted progress on energy access in the Asia-Pacific region, but also remaining challenges. In her opening remarks, ESCAP Executive Secretary Shamshad Akhtar noted that the region remains “the most energy intensive” in the world. The SDG Knowledge Hub summary of the meeting is here.

As an input to the assessment of SDG 7, a series of 27 policy briefs was developed by the Ad Hoc Informal Multi-stakeholder Technical Group of Advisors on SDG 7. Each brief features key messages and statistics on progress so far, as well as priority actions to accelerate movement towards the Goal. The briefs are categorized into four sections: 1) advancing SDG 7 implementation; 2) interlinkages between SDG 7 and other Goals; 3) regional perspectives; and 4) “toward a sustainable and equitable energy future.”

Under the first heading, the papers look at trends in achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix, financing SDG 7 and more. The brief on electricity access notes the difference between having a source of electricity and having universal access, cautioning that the former does not guarantee the latter. The brief on cooking fuels highlights that 40% of households (3 billion people) still prepare meals using “traditional” stoves, which poses a risk to both human health and the environment. It notes that upwards of 4.3 million deaths each year are attributable to household air pollution, and lists priority actions for policy, planning, finance and monitoring, such that clean cooking fuels can be realized for all. The brief on increasing the share renewables notes that 80% of total final energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, but that 60% could of electricity be generated by renewables by 2030. The finance brief highlights the importance of policy measures on both the demand-side (i.e. de-risking investment, carbon pricing) and supply-side (financial system reform). It also outlines the potential for financial technology (“fintech”) solutions to facilitate the development of small-scale, distributed energy systems.

A brief linking energy, climate and transport calls for prioritizing alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

Ten policy briefs highlight linkages between SDG 7 and other Goals. The brief linking energy to poverty and inequality highlights that “energy is a precondition for economic development,” meaning that achieving SDG 7 is not only a goal in itself, but also a means of achieving others. The water-energy-food nexus brief notes that policy coherence is key to managing tradeoffs and synergies, given increasing needs across all three areas. Connecting energy to health, Policy Brief #10 recalls the above statistic on clean cooking fuels, also describing how energy enables health services (i.e. through vaccine refrigeration and equipment sterilization) and offering examples of how SDG 7 contributes to targets under SDG 3. The briefs linking energy to climate and transport call for prioritizing reduced emissions and alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

The ‘Regional Perspective’ category dedicates papers to energy trends in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Arab region, as well as a brief covering Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The fourth category unpacks long-term and systemic issues, such as energy pathways to 2050 and the linkages between indicators, data and energy. The papers were developed in conjunction with stakeholders from the UN system, bilateral governments, multilateral actors and civil society.

During the meeting, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Southeast Asia.’ The report describes macroeconomic and social trends, analyzes the current energy landscape and recent investment and deployment trends, and outlines the benefits of decentralized renewable energy. It finds that, although 65 million people in the region currently lack reliable electricity access, there remains potential to tap significant renewable energy resources whilst adding jobs in the energy sector. The report makes a case for diversifying energy production through renewables, noting that there were over 611,000 renewable energy jobs in the region as of 2016. The report also highlights socio-economic, health and environmental benefits from decentralized renewable energy, offering a goal-level mapping to the SDGs starting on page 131.

As previewed in last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Region convened from 1-2 March in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum discussed Goal 7 among the other SDGs to be reviewed at the HLPF. Case studies of national experiences in implementing the Goals in ECE countries were provided by governments and other stakeholders for discussion at the meeting. They examine how energy systems are being made more efficient, what initiatives have enabled increased investment, and the policies and measures that have been implemented to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.” A session on ‘transforming energy in support of the 2030 Agenda’ explored the reconciliation of countries’ emissions targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change with their short-term reliance on fossil fuels.

Additional knowledge products were released outside of the meetings. A separate report by IRENA finds that, despite the EU’s current reliance on fossil fuels, member countries “could cost effectively double the share of renewable energy by 2030.” The finding, one of many from ‘Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union,’ comes as part of a broader, bottom-up REmap analysis that assesses and aggregates countries’ and regions’ renewable energy potential. REmap’s aim is to build a roadmap that looks not only on technologies for electricity, but also for heating, cooling and transportation

A joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) and Facebook looks at options for bridging the “digital divide,” noting that nearly 4 billion people lack internet access. Titled ‘Powering Last-Mile Connectivity,’ the paper frames the issues partly as one of a need for better infrastructure to increase efficiency. The paper cites that mobile network operators spend up to US$3.8 billion on fuel alone to power infrastructure, and that for consumers, charging mobile phones is both costly and time-consuming if charging points are far away, as is often the case in rural areas. The findings highlight the importance of the interlinkages across the SDGs, particularly the interface between SDG 7 and SDG 9,

The Center for Global Development released a policy paper titled, ‘What Can We Learn about Energy Access and Demand from Mobile-Phone Surveys? Nine Findings from Twelve African Countries.’ While not explicitly covering SDG 7, the paper offers insight as to both survey techniques and challenges facing universal access to energy services (SDG target 7.1).

At the city level, new analyses by CDP find that 102 cities worldwide now source at least 70% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Detailed coverage of the CDP report, and related energy news from the BP, Coal India, and the Government of Ireland, is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The first set of reports will be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 17), scheduled for early 2019.

UNCCD Parties adopted the new strategic framework during the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13) in September 2017. Unlike the previous 10-year Strategy where countries primarily reported against a set of “performance” indicators, future reports will highlight countries’ progress and impact in relation to five strategic objectives that seek to: improve the condition of ecosystems and affected populations; mitigate drought; derive global environmental benefits; and mobilize financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention.

In view of weak reporting capacity in some countries, the UNCCD’s PRAIS (Performance Review and Assessment of Implementation System) online platform provides access to partly pre-filled templates containing default data on three biophysical indicators (trends in land cover, trends in land productivity, and trends in carbon stocks above and below ground.) These three indicators were also adopted under the SDG framework for reporting on progress towards target 15.3 on land degradation neutrality (LDN).

Since 2014, the UNCCD Secretariat and Global Mechanism have provided support to more than 100 countries to embark on their LDN target setting processes. This initiative, as well as the launch of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) “enabling funding portfolio,” coordinated by the UN Environment Programme, are expected to lend support to countries in producing standardized and high quality reports. In addition, as part of preparations for CRIC 17, the UNCCD Secretariat and its partners are convening six regional capacity building workshops to explore the status of implementation and various issues linked to monitoring and reporting that will also touch on national and regional synergies with the SDG process.

The conclusions respond to the session’s priority theme, ‘Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.’

CSW 62 convened from 12-23 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with a focus on ‘Empowering Rural Women and Girls.’ CSW 62 considered the review theme, ‘participation in and access of women to the media, and information and communications technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women.’ Over 4,400 representatives from 170 Member States and more than 600 civil society organizations participated in CSW 62.

On information and communications technology (ICT), representatives of 12 countries shared national progress on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment through ICT. Belgium highlighted women’s underrepresentation in media, stressing that women “practically disappear” from media as they age, and shared tools developed to address this challenge, including awareness-raising campaigns. Denmark called for governments and enterprises to be more proactive in promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Saudi Arabia described initiatives to bridge the digital divide between men and women and urban and rural areas. New Zealand expressed concern about “digital harm,” including cyberbullying.

On land tenure, the Commission held a panel on ‘The role of rural women’s land rights and land tenure security in reaching the SDGs.’ Panelists underscored the importance of extending gender equality to land rights and ownership, saying that unless women have equal access to land, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will “become an impossible vision.” Out of 161 countries surveyed, 37 countries have specific laws that grant men and women equal rights to own, use and control land. Panelists urged advancing women’s land rights as a way to catalyze progress on women’s empowerment, including through better implementation of land laws, collecting data on gender-based rights and tenure security, and leveraging the SDG’s land indicators.

The CSW recognized synergies between the work of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including complementarities in the themes of CSW 62 and the 2018 HLPF with respect to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Commission considered a note by the Secretariat, titled ‘Input to the work of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (E/CN.6/2018/11),’ that summarizes the Commission’s potential contributions to the HLPF. CSW’s Agreed Conclusions will be transmitted to ECOSOC and the HLPF for inclusion in their work.

The CSW Agreed Conclusions recommend specific measures to end poverty and enhance women and girls’ food security and nutrition, access to education, health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, decent work, land and productive assets, and rural infrastructure and technology, such as safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and clean stoves. The Conclusions call for ending all forms of violence and harmful practices that impact women and girls.

Women and girls have clearly stated what they want: the rights to own property, the need for quality infrastructure, and the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.

UN Women’ s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described the Agreed Conclusions as a “vital step forward” for ensuring equality for women and girls in rural areas. She emphasized that women and girls have clearly stated what they want: “from the rights to own property, to the need for quality infrastructure, to the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.” CSW 62 Chair Geraldine Byrne Nason (Ireland) stressed that the Agreed Conclusions affirm the Commission’s commitment to leave no one behind, and provide real outcomes to address the lives of rural women and girls.

In the Conclusions, CSW emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship among the empowerment and women and girls, the realization of their human rights and gender equality and the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To ensure their full implementation, the Commission’s recommendations focus on: strengthening normative and legal frameworks and eliminating laws and policies that discriminate against rural women and girls; implementing economic and social policies for the empowerment of rural women and girls, including by building the resilience of rural women and girls to climate change and environmental degradation such as deforestation, desertification and loss of agricultural biodiversity and systematically measuring and incorporating the value of unpaid work performed by rural women and girls in calculations of gross domestic products (GDP) and formulation of economic and social policies; and strengthening the collective voice, leadership and decision-making of rural women and girls.

The CSW also held sessions on: data collection approaches for measuring progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment; gender-based cyberviolence; cooperation between global and regional mechanisms dealing with violence and discrimination against women; and other topics.

Numerous events took place on the sidelines of CSW 62. Estonia hosted an event on ‘Ending violence against women—opportunities and challenges of ICT.’ Speaking at the event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted how ICT innovations can expand economic pathways and improve service delivery and access. However, she observed, the digital gender divide is widening, and more and better data is necessary to understand “the scope of violence against women and girls facilitated by technology.”

The Women’s Empowerment Principles Forum discussed opportunities for business to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Speakers also shared good practices in implementing the Principles, to which almost 2,000 CEOs globally have committed. Participants highlighted the role of gender equality in achieving all of the SDGs, but underscored that gender inequalities remain pervasive in every dimension of sustainable development. In remarks at this event, Mohammed called for action in four areas: placing gender equality at the center of implementation; closing the financing gap, including by identifying innovative sources of funding; improving monitoring through disaggregated data on gender and strengthened national statistical systems; and strengthening accountability for gender commitments at all levels.

These were among the key areas identified for building consensus among Member States, following the first round of intergovernmental negotiations on the compact.

The second round of negotiations convened from 12-15 March 2018, in New York, US. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference convening from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico. The first session of negotiations took place on 20, 22 and 23 February 2018.

During governments’ debate on the differentiation between irregular and regular migration, Comoros for the African Group said the focus should be on the individual well being of migrants, and thus the differences between irregular and regular migration should be discussed with a view to addressing specific vulnerabilities. The African Group, supported by many (mostly origin) countries including Tuvalu, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Eritrea, Cuba, Jamaica, Nepal, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Brazil for a group of countries including Argentina, Canada, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala and Peru, added that all migrants, irregular or regular, have the right to human rights and international assistance. These countries expressed support for expanding the pathways to legalizing migration, with many noting that all migrants should be able to participate fully in the economic and social lives in their countries of destination.

Austria for a group of 27 countries (including Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the UK, Sweden and Spain), expressed a position largely supported by many (mostly destination) countries, including Australia, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Guyana, Equatorial Guinea, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Azerbaijan, South Africa and Belarus, anchored in a clear distinction between regular and irregular migration. She explained that irregular migration undermines public trust in migration, puts irregular migrants at risk of exploitation, and is a negative phenomenon. She noted that the compact needs to be based on national sovereignty, and to clearly state that deciding migrants’ status is “the full sovereign right of states.” She added that while human rights and basic services, such as health and legal assistance services, need to be ensured to all migrants, some rights should be applied only to regular migrants, such as the right to equally participate in the economy.

Australia added that he does not support commitments to expanding pathways for the legalization of migration, nor a series of services and/or rights such as family reintegration or participation in the economy. Turkey cautioned against any language that might appear as encouraging irregular migration, adding that all economic objectives in the compact need to apply only to regular migrants. The African Group replied that the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work does not differentiate between the statuses of migrants with regards to the right to work in destination countries.

Hungary said the document is unbalanced, resulting in a “pro-migration document.” He emphasized that “migration is bad and needs to be stopped,” and the efforts of the international community should not aim only to manage migration. The role of the UN, he noted, should be to protect the sovereignty and security of its Member States, to which migration is posing a great risk. He stressed that the violation of a state’s border is a serious crime that should be punished in a very strict way. Hungary continued that the right to migration is not a fundamental human right, and that multiculturalism is not a value of its own and it is not more valuable than a homogenous society. He said Hungary has been a Christian country and wants to preserve that. He concluded that until his country’s position is fully reflected in the compact, Hungary will constantly object to it.

Switzerland, supported by Canada, said sovereignty does not only entail deciding who enters a country’s territory, but also protecting all persons on that territory, the question being what rights apply to each situation. He said access to basic education, basic health and basic law enforcement are important in order to guarantee human rights. Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, emphasized that the human rights of all children need to be protected irrespective of their migratory status, and said children pose no security risks.

During the debate on the differentiation between migrants and refugees, all delegates agreed that the compact on migrants and the compact on refugees should: complement each other; avoid overlaps and contradictions; and, while recognizing mixed flows of people, avoid creation of a new legal category. The issue of how to address the situation of vulnerable migrants who are displaced by climate change or natural disasters, cannot go back to their countries, and yet do not qualify for refugee status (under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) ignited a heated debate. Some countries, including China, Australia and Austria for the group of 27 European countries, said international protection should only apply to refugees, not to migrants or to people displaced by climate change and natural disasters, to whom countries could be invited to provide support or national protection, but not international protection.

Others, including Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, the African Group and Tuvalu, said the principle of non-refoulement (not forcing refugees or asylum seekers to return to a country in which they are liable to be subjected to persecution) is stipulated not only by international law on refugees but also by human rights law. Therefore, it should be applied also to vulnerable migrants, in addition to refugees. Lebanon and others strongly opposed extending the principle to migrants.

El Salvador, supported by Switzerland, stressed the need to establish a minimum standard of protection, explaining that there are issues not captured in the 1951 Refugee Convention or its protocols because the context was different then, and now climate-induced displacement requires response. India and Japan proposed that vulnerable migrants be addressed under the refugee compact. The African Group noted that mixed movements of people should be addressed in both compacts, because different measures are necessary at different stages of the mixed movements, with some measures for migrants and some for refugees.

During the debate on implementation, follow-up and review, Japan and other countries opposed the creation of new mechanisms. Other countries, including the African Group, Indonesia, Bahamas, Brazil, India, El Salvador, the Philippines and Jamaica, supported the creation of the new proposed capacity building mechanism. Some countries, including Australia and Austria for the group of 27 European countries, stressed that contributions to any mechanisms should be voluntary. Several countries, including Turkey, China, South Africa, Switzerland and the African Group, called for all states to embrace the principle of shared responsibility and for donors to make financial contributions in support of developing and the least development countries (LDCs), with the African Group, Cuba and China asking for respecting and increasing the current official development assistance (ODA) commitments. Russia opposed the principle of shared responsibility, stating that the countries that originated the migration crisis should be the ones “shouldering the burden.”

Some countries, including Norway and Mexico, expressed support for a “strong organizational base” for the review of the compact. Norway, supported by Argentina and Guatemala, added that reviews might be necessary more often than every four years, maybe every two years. Australia, supported by Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Austria, the Philippines and Switzerland, stressed that the follow-up and review and the implementation of the compact should be state-led, supported by the private sector and civil society. Russia opposed the involvement of civil society. While Bangladesh and others called for a strong follow-up and review based on clear targets and indicators, others like Australia, Lichtenstein, India, Indonesia and Thailand favored a “light touch.” China strongly opposed the idea of indicators.

After the two days dedicated to these key areas for consensus building, delegates conducted a reading of the “zero draft plus,” which contained only minor technical changes compared to the zero draft. A new draft incorporating the substantive changes requested will be released before the next negotiation session, convening from 3-6 April 2018.

35,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/african-leaders-sign-free-trade-agreement/,"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,African Leaders Sign Free Trade Agreement,"22 March 2018: African leaders signed the Kigali Declaration for the Launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The agreement creates one of the world’s largest trading blocks, and aims to dramatically increase intra-African trade by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services.

African leaders from 44 countries signed the AfCFTA during the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union (AU) Summit. Leaders had agreed to hold the Extraordinary Session at the 30th Ordinary Session of the AU. At the AfCFTA signing ceremony, AU Chairperson Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, said the AfCFTA represents the “culmination of a vision set forth nearly 40 years ago” in the Lagos Plan of Action, in which African leaders called for a continent-wide market.

According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the agreement has the potential to increase intra-African trade by 52.3%. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has estimated that eliminating intra-African tariffs could generate US$3.6 billion in welfare gains for Africa through cheaper goods and an increase in production.

The agreement is anticipated to benefit Africa’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up 80% of the region’s business, as well as women, who account for 70% of informal cross-border traders, and youth through employment opportunities. Apart from these advances towards the 2030 Agenda’s vision of leaving no one behind, the AfCFTA is an important step towards “achieving the SDGs and delivering on the African agenda of peace and prosperity,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. He said the entire UN system will support Africa as it moves towards the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, including through the Joint AU-UN Agreement for the implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.

UNECA Executive Secretary Vera Songwe welcomed the agreement as “a giant strike forward in continental integration, in the pan-African vision and in the development of our continent.” Songwe also underscored the importance of maintaining momentum on the agreement through effective implementation. To track implementation, the UNECA launched the AfCFTA Country Business Index, a tool that aims to monitor progress on the AfCFTA through surveys of business opinions on the agreement’s impact on trade. The AfCFTA Country Business Index tool will rank countries in four areas: AfCFTA implementation; ease of trade; trade for development, the SDGs and Agenda 2063; and AfCFTA impact.

AfCFTA will enter into force once the required number of countries – 22 out of the AU’s 55 member States – have ratified the agreement. As for signatories, to date, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Saharawi Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, the Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Western Sahara, and Zimbabwe have signed the AfCFTA.

The 3rd Pacific Regional NDC Dialogue fleshed out the elements of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub, and provided an opportunity for Pacific island States to discuss NDC-related experiences and needs.

The NDC dialogue and consultations on the NDC Hub took place in Suva, Fiji, from 12-14 March 2018. During the meeting, countries exchanged experiences in NDC implementation, including implementing energy projects, reviewing and revising legislation to create a more enabling environment for NDC implementation, and establishing green energy funds. Participants elaborated on links between the NDCs and their national development plans, national energy plans and strategies, and SDG implementation.

Participants urged mainstreaming NDC implementation into national sectoral and budget processes, and identified challenges and barriers related to, inter alia, financing, capacity, and skills and data gaps. Many countries stated their desire to: enhance their NDCs by adding sectors such as transport, forestry and agriculture; strengthen the adaptation element in their NDCs; and communicate their ambitions through the Talanoa Dialogue. They also discussed opportunities for enhancing the gender responsiveness of NDCs and using NDC implementation to advance gender equality.

On identifying opportunities to translate NDCs into actionable projects, particularly in the energy sector, and linkages with sectoral planning, countries highlighted establishing energy committees, and developing projects in solar energy, biomass and hydropower. Participants underscored linkages between the NDCs and sectoral energy planning documents. Many emphasized that they are using existing sectoral energy strategies as NDC implementation plans.

On finance, participants stressed the need to develop financing strategies to support NDC implementation, including the development of investment plans, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the creation of enabling environments for private sector investment.

Participants agreed on the details of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub in terms of services provided, as well as the funding mechanism, structure and governance, and finalized the draft design document based on national priorities and needs. They agreed that the Hub should provide assistance on enhancement, review and inclusion of adaptation, and guidance on synergies between mitigation and resilience.

The Regional Pacific NDC Hub is an arm of the NDC Partnership, which aims to enhance cooperation and countries’ access to the necessary technical knowledge and financial support for NDC implementation.

On new ideas for services to be provided by the Hub, they proposed, inter alia, NDC roadmaps beyond 2030, knowledge management platforms, support for national reporting, expansion of NDCs to new sectors, desegregating sectoral targets, and knowledge sharing with other regions.

On delivery mechanisms, participants suggested, inter alia, online NDC training, and strengthening national and regional knowledge management. They also supported reviving and improving the Regional Technical Support Mechanism by increasing the pool of experts including women, ensuring the use of local counterparts to retain local expertise, and providing unconditional funding and technical assistance.

On governance and steering of the Hub, participants agreed, inter alia, to build on existing structures and link to the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific and Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP).

Participants also agreed on the next steps for the Hub, including: discussing the link to the PRP at the PRP Task Force meeting in April 2018; establishing terms of reference (ToR) for the Hub’s management team; and tabling the dialogue’s outcomes at other regional meetings to get further regional buy-in on the positioning and nature of the Hub.

The event was co-organized by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UNFCCC Secretariat, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), NDC Partnership, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the Pacific Community and the Government of Fiji. The Regional Pacific NDC Hub is an arm of the NDC Partnership, which was launched in 2016 to enhance cooperation and countries’ access to the necessary technical knowledge and financial support for NDC implementation.

Of particular relevance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the theme of the Day was ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities,’ to increase awareness of the contributions of forests to sustainable cities, from cooling the environment and saving energy to providing health benefits and drinking water, and building resilience against floods and storms.

A special event was organized at UN Headquarters in New York, US by the Secretariat of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), with participation from representatives of Member States, and international, regional and non-governmental organizations. The event featured an opening session chaired by UNFF 13 Chair Amb. Muhammad Shahrul Ikram Yaakob (Malaysia); a panel discussion on safeguarding forests for sustainable cities and communities; and a general discussion on forests, sustainable cities and the 2030 Agenda.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) celebrated the Day at a special ceremony at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy attended by city administrators from Lima, Peru; Ljubljana, Slovenia; Philadelphia, US; and Mantova, Italy. The event featured the screening of the 2018 International Day of Forests video spot on forests and sustainable cities, and the launch of a FAO publication titled, ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities – Inspiring Stories from around the World.’ The publication highlights different ways in which cities around the globe have used forests and trees to improve the living conditions of their citizens, which may serve as inspiration for others. In 2012, Beijing, China initiated the largest afforestation programme in its history, which resulted in forests now covering more than 25% of the city plain. Karura forest in the central north of Nairobi, Kenya, once a crime-ridden area, has been saved from property development following a public campaign led by environmental activist Wangari Maathai, and has become a source of opportunities and recreation for local people and tourists. In Lima, a municipality afforestation project resulted in a park with trails and family recreation spaces while reducing the threat of natural disasters, including earthquakes and landslides.

Forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, supporting – climate action; clean air; food, energy and water security; improved well-being; and social cohesion.

The latest issue of the FAO forestry publication ‘Unasylva’ is also devoted to urban forestry in celebration of the Day. Looking at urban and peri-urban forestry, including its benefits, pitfalls, governance and challenges, the issue shows that forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, such as regulating climate, storing carbon, removing air pollutants, reducing the risk of flooding, assisting in food, energy and water security, improving the physical and mental health of citizens, and increasing social cohesion.

A special event was also held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, organized by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Housing and Land Management Unit, the UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section and the FAO Liaison Office in Geneva. The event showcased unique ways in which forests have gone “vertical,” with speakers presenting innovative ideas on urban farming, wood construction and architecture.

On the occasion, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) circulated a new infographic illustrating the benefits that tropical forests provide cities. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) showcased the battle for reversing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, made possible following the vision provided by the Government of Brazil and GEF support to create a network of protected areas and nature reserves. The Amazon Region Protected Areas programme, initiated in 2002, has exceeded all its targets and has recently been joined by two other key GEF-financed programmes. One will maintain tens of millions of hectares of forest land in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru; the other is an integrated project aiming to promote sustainable agriculture, which will reduce pressure on the dry forests adjoining the Amazon. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment) signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Airlines, focusing on greening the airlines operations. The memorandum outlines several action areas to promote sustainability, most notably the development of the ‘Plant one tree for every passenger flown’ project, in collaboration with the ongoing REDD+ programme in Ethiopia. The objective of the project is to plant nine million trees in the name of Ethiopian Airlines in different regions of Ethiopia.

Other recent developments of relevance included: two publications on REDD+ in Ethiopia and in Kenya; and the approval of a new US$33 million project, partly funded by GEF, to improve sustainable rural livelihoods and forest protection in Zambia. The publications examine, from a REDD+ point of view, the contribution of forests to national income in Ethiopia, and ways to improve efficiency in forestry operations and forest product processing in Kenya.

CANBERRA — Water, sanitation, and hygiene is “fundamental” to Australia’s development assistance and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific told Devex.

Her comments at the WASH Futures conference in Brisbane, Australia, came as the Australian government announced an extension of a partnership between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the World Health Organization to deliver safe drinking water through the WHO-DFAT Water Quality Partnership.

“When you look at water, sanitation, and hygiene, they are fundamental to our overseas development assistance,” Fierravanti-Wells said in an interview. “Indeed, they are at the heart of our Sustainable Development Goals. If you do not have water, if you do not have sanitation, and if you do not have hygiene, then that is a catalyst for a whole range of other issues.”

Between 2012 and 2017, DFAT invested 15 million Australian dollars ($11.78 million) to the partnership. It has so far supported 15 countries in the Indo-Pacific region through the development of water safety plans to help identify complete water supply system, including hazards and risks, and ways to manage them safety. Water safety plans have been implemented across 882 water systems in the 15 countries, supporting more than 35 million people.

The new announcement sees the Australian government investing an additional AU$5 million over five years, and narrowing the focus to four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam.

While the financial investment and geographic focus is a reduction in Australia’s previous contribution, the partnership has still been maintained in an era of a reduced Australian aid budget. Here, Devex delves into what makes this program and partnership project a valuable investment to Australia.

Deliverables of the partnership

Previous Australian aid funding to the Water Quality Partnership supported phases two and three. Phases one and two began the process of building plans and momentum for them in countries being supported. Phase three had a strong focus on creating sustainability through capacity building and encouraging strong local ownership with the water safety plans.

The new funding extends the work of phase three — including capacity building — to specifically deliver water safety, good drinking water, and good sanitation services.

A gender focus was also introduced in phase three, which will be expanded upon in line with Australia’s aid priorities. Australia has a target of 80 percent of its aid to have a gender focus and last year they achieved 78 percent.

“Women are at the heart of what we do, and are the heart of what we do in the Pacific, and [it] will be important to see gender and gender issues — women and girls — at the forefront of the work we do with the World Health Organization,” Fierravanti-Wells said.

But Fierravanti-Wells said the ability to make an impact on vulnerable populations is the most important deliverable.

“We have to think about the fact that 1,000 children a day die from preventable diseases caused by lack of clean water and sanitation,” she said. “Two billion people do not have access to clean drinking water. And about 4.5 billion people around the world do not have access to or are affected by lack of proper sanitation services. So therefore what we do in our region, and what we do with the World Health Organization, will feed into these important objectives.”

Building and maintaining partnerships

The notion of partnerships is important in the Australian aid program today, including encouraging partnerships with foreign governments, NGOs, research institutes, and the private sector. And building and maintaining partnerships is important to the Australian government in continuing this partnership, according to Fierravanti-Wells.

The Water Quality Partnership allows Australia to work closely with recipient countries in the region to strengthen partnership and deliver safe drinking water. But it also allows DFAT and WHO to share knowledge and capability — and continue to build and maintain their relationship. Fierravanti-Wells said the partnership is complementary to the work WHO does, allowing DFAT to gain knowledge from them. And Australia can share their expertise in water management, having had to manage water in a dry climate.

But the partnership between DFAT and WHO has had to evolve to make the Water Quality Partnership more effective in its use of funds.

An Australian aid evaluation report released in 2014 identified high administration costs of the program due to dual administration both at WHO headquarters and from the Australian side within a South East Asia program hub. In 2012, program administration accounted for approximately 23 percent of total expenditure.

“The reason these four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam — have been chosen is that there is a particularly strong World Health Organization structure in those countries,” Fierravanti-Wells said

And by building the new phase of the project around countries with a strong WHO presence, duplication in administration is prevented and each partner can focus on their strengths.

The importance of WASH in Australian aid

According to Fierravanti-Wells, WASH programs “wash through” all aspects of Australian aid deliverables, making it essential to their work. She identified humanitarian responses as one of many examples where WASH crossed through other aid priorities as a fundamental area of support — a higher priority than rebuilding.

Beyond the Water Quality Partnership, Fierravanti-Wells sees Australian aid continuing to invest in, develop, and advance new ways of responding to challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene. The WASH Futures conference was a way of advancing this objective, with participants from the Indo-Pacific were financially supported by DFAT to attend and discuss challenges, issues, and solutions for the region in WASH.

“This conference itself having drawn people from so many parts of the Indo-Pacific is about generating those ideas,” Fierravanti-Wells said. “And when you look at the work that is going to be done over the conference, it is a very granular way that we approach these WASH issues — and I have absolutely no doubt there will be some absolutely fantastic ideas that come out of these days which we and our partners in this space will be able to capitalize on.”

“I’m putting it out there that new ideas are always welcome,” she added.","Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific, on gender issues and WASH. Footage courtesy of DFAT.

Oommen C. Kurian

The world’s progress in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends to a large extent on India’s progress. India plays a strong leadership role at the global level around meeting these targets set by the international community in 2015. In July 2017, India reiterated its commitment to meeting the SDGs when it submitted a Voluntary National Review report on seven goals including poverty, health, hunger and nutrition, as well as gender equality at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

Despite progress in recent years, India continues to be hobbled by high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Disease, malnutrition and preventable loss of life pose a huge economic challenge and are a drain on the nation’s human resources. Indian policy documents have started acknowledging this lately. For one, the Economic Survey 2016 by the Ministry of Finance acknowledged that while there are intrinsic reasons to invest in maternal and early-life nutrition programmes, they are particularly important for their high returns on investment. These programmes contribute to early physical and cognitive development that significantly influence the success of subsequent interventions—schooling and training— and outcomes in adulthood. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent months has used various platforms to emphasise the importance of “development for all” and “development of all”. The prime minister recognises that a country aspiring to reach double-digit economic growth rates—and sustain them—must focus on health and nutrition policy, which are the mainstays of a productive workforce. This thinking is amply reflected in the ambitious Ayushman Bharat initiative as well as the National Nutrition Mission.

The SDGs are fundamentally interdependent goals and as such, action is required across various sectors in order to achieve them. Further, several of the goals and their collective externalities have the potential of contributing to India’s economic growth. For India to realise its growth potential, it is crucial to address the building blocks of better health, enhanced nutrition, women’s empowerment, and digital financial inclusion—all of which have the power to unlock the demographic dividend. In this context, the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) explored the various issues related to the implementation of the SDGs in India through a high-level conference on 30 August 2017. This volume builds on the themes discussed at the conference. India’s performance on the SDGs is critical for the world to achieve the goals. Is there an “India model” that can offer lessons to the world? For that, India must deliver on the SDGs in an equitable manner and ensure development for all citizens. India needs to move forward on this agenda by working on the SDGs in an integrated manner.

Meeting health goals has implications on India realising its demographic dividend and its growth potential. Indeed, India stands to lose some US$4.58 trillion every year due to productivity losses related to NCDs and mental illness, among other health problems. Every year, more than 60 lakh people are being pushed below the poverty line by prohibitive health expenses. Public expenditure on health is only 1.4 percent of GDP, and although India’s total health expenditure stands at 4.7 percent of GDP (around INR 5 trillion) – much of it is out-of-pocket expenditure. Similarly, while 20-30 percent of healthcare is sought through the public sector, almost 70 percent of care is sought in the private sector.

The public-private mix of financing and service provision for health in India raises the question: Do solutions also need to be hybrid? The SDGs bring with them the challenge of finding a comprehensive approach – the goals are intrinsically linked, they focus on multi-sectoral action, and they emphasise equity. Can India respond to this challenge by leveraging the entire health system – involving both the public and private sectors –to deliver on national goals?

India’s high economic growth and increasing food production have failed to transform the nutritional status of its population. Malnutrition, in turn, has a deep impact on cognitive development in children. It is estimated that in India, every US$1 invested in nutrition has a return of $36 (or three times more than the global average). Both academic research and India’s experience on the ground show that to address malnutrition, a multi-sectoral approach is required. This translates to prioritising action across poverty alleviation, education, gender empowerment, agriculture, and sanitation. Joint planning to make programmes nutrition-sensitive is key to addressing malnutrition, along with independent implementation and joint monitoring. How can a multi-sectoral approach help solve India’s complex challenges?

Lack of data often hinders effective evaluation of health schemes and reduces the scope for mid-course correction. There is a need to strengthen the national statistical system to allow for goals to be tracked at disaggregated levels. Technology must be harnessed to streamline processes, and there should be an integrated system which allows for analyses to be run across different data sets. Experience of data-use by stakeholders needs to be discussed to identify systemic constraints that hamper evidence-based decisionmaking in the country’s health sector.

Finally, an integrated set of solutions is needed to address complex issues challenging the economy and society. Ensuring progress on gender, health, and nutrition will be key to driving India’s economic growth and development. While India has focused on a set of reforms, those in the area of human development have not received adequate attention. These reforms are critical to India’s growth. India should acknowledge the strong linkages between national goals and act in an integrated manner, leveraging national initiatives like ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ and ‘JAM trinity’ (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) to improve development outcomes.

India for the World; India for India

Shalini Rudra

Solutions to development challenges in a nation with 1.3 billion people should be more than just scalable replications of venerable remedies offered by the wealthy nations. This was the scope of the conference, “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, held in Delhi in August 2017 and attended by stakeholders from government, academia, and development organisations.

The conference was one in a series of events that are being organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to ponder issues related to the implementation of the SDGs framework in India. The theme of the event was linking the SDGs to India’s growth agenda. The discussion was framed around the criticality of such frameworks in offering solutions to reconcile sustainability with equitable development, focusing on health and allied sectors.

Mr Sunjoy Joshi, ORF Chairman, in his welcome address said that the SDG framework was a robust and comprehensive development objective that represents India’s aspirations. The SDG goals, Mr Joshi said, should remain at the core of responsible policy-making being embraced by India to attain the country’s economic and social goals.

The health-nutrition-sanitation triad of well-being holds the key to a nation’s social, political and economic advancement. Contrasting realities across India—of excellent performance in some attributes and massive failure in others—projects India as a hub of innovating resilient policies that juxtaposes contrasts. For instance—on one hand, India’s economic aid diplomacy has made an impact across Africa and Asia, while on the other, it is home to almost a quarter (195 million) of the world’s undernourished. Even as India steadily gains ground as a global power, it is yet to complete its own domestic transformation and address its fundamental developmental challenges.

Investing in health, nutrition and sanitation, mandated under the SDGs framework, also gives the Asian economies scope to harness the strengths of the largest cohort of the young. By spearheading policies to reap the benefits of a healthy demographic dividend, developing economies like India and China have the potential to make the present century, truly the “Asian century”.

To push the SDGs agenda, the key highlights of policies and programmes in India should be on developing a robust institutional framework supported by the right kind of combinations of skills and financial resources. Second, India needs to find solutions by employing data-driven analytics and monitoring solutions to strategise course correction. Thus, work on the 2030 agenda should begin with an acknowledgement of the interdependence and links between goals, with all complexities intertwined. While developing solutions to mitigate the development challenges, countries like India have had success stories that are worth looking at. Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in India, observed that India has on various occasions exhibited a business model that can be replicated. He referred to the successful implementation of the JAM trinity—Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile penetration—as well as Indian leadership in generic drugs manufacturing and production and distribution of low-cost LED bulbs.

These schemes have defied problems linked to scalability by channeling the least-cost and most innovative methods, and maximising the involvement of government to co-produce sustainable development. India, being the largest functioning democracy with immense scope of industrial growth, can mobilise its strengths to conceptualise participation in an industrial revolution of smart manufacturing. Discussing the cornerstone position of the democratic system, Mr Afanasiev emphasised how due processes in a democratic setup like India work out solutions to problems with a certain degree of sustainability and efficiency. Thus, instead of simply emulating established successful models from elsewhere, India must build on its people’s strengths of innovation and creativity—and call it ‘jugaad’ with a positive spin.

In his address, Dr David Wilson of the World Bank highlighted aspects related to human development in India. He noted that while India is ranked by the World Bank as the world’s third-largest economy by purchasing power, in the World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index, India stands 105th out of 130 countries—behind all the BRICS countries and Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Another paradox is that India has the largest number of tertiary graduates in the world while being home to the largest number of the world’s illiterates. India ranks a low 116th of 157 countries on the SDG Index and given its population share, India has an uphill task ahead to achieve urgent improvements in education, employment and health. In fact, child health and nutrition is of fundamental concern because of its long-term impact on individual well-being and the economy. India has the ability to identify developmental concerns and the capacity to arrive at policy solutions. The case of successful HIV/AIDS prevention programmes through vast community engagement and effective surveillance is an important example of India’s organisational ability and programme management. Here, management and administration of national and state-level AIDS Control Society has played a major role.

Policy-making in India is effective because it builds on existing strengths and works around the weaknesses of institutions and models. Similarly, India formed major national and international partnerships with developmental agencies (such as BMGF, USAID, DfID, and the World Bank) for programme support, technical inputs and capacity building.

To achieve the SDGs, India must display an urgency and adopt a similar model that harnesses the skills at the national, state and local levels. India should expand its focus beyond conventional public-health strategies and devise alternatives that are based on community engagement, accountability, and the recognition of rights. Social and economic inclusion are also necessary to achieve greater impact from various technical public-health solutions. With advances in science and technology, policymakers and programme managers can make use of Big Data, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and other technologies for efficient targeting and delivery of various services.

Communication and outreach have also improved tremendously and should be used effectively in programme design. The eradication of Tuberculosis, for example, is an area where direct benefits of such technological coordination and community engagement can make an immediate impact. The Government of India has allocated an increased share of budget towards TB eradication. However, the constant search for a cost-effective model of healthcare delivery is critical, as sometimes, different solutions are required for varied problems.

Overall, it is important that India continues its focus on development innovations and programme implementation based on dynamic partnerships between government, the private sector, civil society and communities. Further, promotion of citizen engagement, accountability, and rights can further accelerate the approach toward the SDGs. India should embark upon achieving Agenda 2030 with an approach that market failure in the delivery of social goods and services such as health and education is a problem everywhere. But collaborations with the private sector for ideas, delivery expertise, finance, can be leveraged to the advantage of the public sector to boost the human capital agenda underlying the SDGs.

The UHC Trajectory: Ensuring Quality Health Services and Financial Protection to All

Priyanka Shah

Goal three of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires all countries to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. This entails access to quality essential health care services; access to safe, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines; as well as financial risk protection for all at all ages. UHC could, therefore, be regarded as an umbrella goal for health in the new development agenda. The importance of this particular target cannot be overemphasised – it not only transcends all other health-related targets but also draws linkages with the rest of the development goals. The achievement of UHC is critical to the success of the overarching vision of the SDGs, which is “to leave no one behind”. Given the population size and health burden of India, one can also posit that the global accomplishment of the SDGs is contingent on India’s success.

While healthcare in India has witnessed considerable progress over the past decade, the pace of improvement has been slow and the country continues to be plagued by multiple challenges. A Lancet study published in 2017 ranks India 127th in terms of meeting the United Nations health-related SDGs – the lowest among its BRICS peers (Figure 1). It is clear, therefore, that India’s fast economic growth has failed so far to translate to significant progress in the health sector. To ensure sustained growth levels, the country requires a strong and healthy workforce – this is possible only when citizens are protected against health-related financial risks and can access quality health services. If India is serious about goal three—as it should be, given that health is a building block for the country’s growth and development—it needs to address the various obstacles to the accomplishment of UHC.

Figure 1: Performance on the Health-related SDG index among BRICS countries

First, it is imperative to look at UHC through a gender lens. This does not mean a discussion on women’s health alone, but an approach to UHC that is inclusive in nature and attends to the needs of men and women. What is needed is a shift in narrative: to recognise that the onus of a woman and child’s health does not fall on women alone but on the entire society. Addressing such issues requires going beyond health and delving into challenges that arise from societal attitudes, and gender discrimination when it comes to nutrition, education and sanitation. Given the patriarchal nature of Indian society, gender equity in health would need approaches that are much more women-centric and supportive of their multiple roles. These social determinants and root causes should be recognised while framing policies to extend UHC in the country.

Next, achieving UHC requires long-term, high-level political commitment. This, unfortunately, has been absent in the Indian context. At a macro level, the government spends a measly proportion (1.18 percent) of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health – among the lowest globally. The long-awaited National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 proposed to increase public health spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025. This is disappointing, to say the least, given that eight years from now India intends to continue spending well below the current world average of 5.99 percent. Together with low public sector investments in health, the system also suffers from poor coordination caused by the presence of a vast number of vertical health programmes (many of which deal with similar issues) and several institutions within the health department that must work together if they are to deliver anything worthwhile. This often leads to bureaucratic apathy and inertia, which tends to slow down delivery of healthcare services and hampers the smooth functioning of the healthcare system.

Finally, given that the private sector is the largest provider of healthcare services in the country, it would be impossible to achieve the 2030 goals without its active involvement. The government, however, should keep the lead as no country has built a successful health system devoid of a central authority. The challenge is in defining the role that the government wants the private sector to play in the provision of healthcare and how it can ensure that funds are spent efficiently. One way to do this would be through price control, as already done with stents. This is an effective tool to extend quality health services at affordable prices. Other such mechanisms need to be explored and implemented to maintain a balanced participation from the private sector.

Way Forward

While it may be tempting to follow the path that other countries have embarked upon to achieve UHC, it is important to remember that India has its own unique challenges and therefore requires context-specific solutions. Within the country, too, certain states are performing exceptionally and so rather than looking outside for lessons, India should look inwards and take lessons from the successes and failures of its own states.

Central to the UHC theme are access, affordability and quality. Given the crucial role of the private sector in the healthcare delivery system, India needs to begin seriously finding an ideal mix of public-private investments. It would also help to clearly define and distinguish the purview of public and private sectors within the health system. The government should leverage private sector resources to fill in the healthcare delivery gaps. Resource allocation is a critical decision that also needs to be taken. Speaking at a high-level consultation organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr. C.K. Mishra, Health Secretary, stated that majority of resources should be directed towards “primary healthcare, to preventive and promotive health. It does not make sense to go on increasing hospital beds and simultaneously go on increasing the number of patients in the country. Therefore, all policies must converge on getting investment into primary healthcare”. In fact, the NHP released this year calls for two-thirds of health resources to flow into the primary health sector.

Should investments flow from public or private sectors, and how much? Where should resources be allocated? How can underlying socio-economic issues causing gender inequities be addressed? How can government accountability and transparency be maintained to ensure political commitment for UHC? Often, asking the right questions is the key to finding solutions. In order to redesign the Indian healthcare system so as to make it conducive to UHC, India needs to first recognise its failures. Perhaps it is time for a dose of realism – identifying gaps and flaws will only help find viable solutions and lead to informed policy-making.

Addressing Malnutrition through a Multi-Sectoral Approach: The Unfinished Agenda and Emerging Challenges

Malancha Chakrabarty

India has won significant battles against malnutrition. Unlike a few decades ago, instances of severe malnutrition such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are now rare. Latest figures from the National Family Health Survey revealed that there has been a ten percentage-point decline in stunting from about 48 percent in 2005-06 to 38.4 percent in 2015-16. However, national figures mask regional variations. On the one hand, there are states like Kerala and Goa which have a low burden of undernutrition. On the other hand, there are states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh which have a high incidence of undernutrition. Within the states, there is also considerable variation. For example, despite Odisha having stunting levels of 34.1 percent (also known as ‘high prevalence’) certain districts such as Cuttack (15.3 percent) and Puri (16.1 percent) are among the top 10 ‘low stunting level’ districts in the country. Similarly, in Karnataka, districts like Mandya have stunting rates as low as 18.6 percent while others such as Koppal have levels as high as 55.8 percent. Overall, however, India’s record in addressing undernutrition has been much poorer when compared to other countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Thus, the war against undernutrition is hardly over and meeting the World Health Assembly targets will be an uphill task for India. Moreover, the problem of undernutrition in India coexists with the problem of overweight and obesity and associated non-communicable diseases for a small, affluent section of the population.

The panellists at the ORF-BMGF conference agreed that India has a plethora of policies that address almost all aspects of the undernutrition problem but the implementation of those policies has been uneven. According to Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, the fundamental flaw in India’s approach has been its “food-centric” understanding of undernutrition. The discourse on undernutrition has largely ignored the social determinants of undernutrition; in particular, the role of women has been underappreciated. Gains in nutrition will be much faster with a more “woman-centric” approach towards tackling undernutrition because it is not food but birth which determines whether a child will be stunted or not. In Menon’s words, “the biggest risk factor for being stunted is who you are born to”. A highly significant burden of stunting is borne by the fact that children in India are born to mothers who are also stunted, uneducated, and not empowered enough to take care of their children. According to Menon, women-centric factors account for a bulk of the difference between high and low stunting rates in India’s states. Therefore, nutrition policies must try to address the key determinants of undernutrition such as women’s body mass index, women’s education, early marriage, and access to ante-natal care.

The panel observed that a multi-sectoral approach towards addressing nutrition is the need of the hour because nutrition does not belong to a single ministry. In fact, narrow departmentalism has been a critical constraint in the case of India. Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development stressed that a whole range of initiatives, better sanitation, clean drinking water, and trained rural medical practitioners, were required to achieve better nutrition in rural areas. Nutrition outcomes tend to be better in areas where public investments have also been made in primary education and health centres, along with nutrition interventions. He gave the example of China where there was a dramatic reduction in child undernutrition and infant mortality during the period 1949-1979—a number of initiatives were behind such success. First, the green tea kettle in school enforced the habit of making children drink boiled water. Public health facilities were improved through immunisation against diseases and training of traditional doctors. Lessons must also be learnt from better-performing states and districts of India. Sinha also underscored the role that communities play in improving the nutritional status of the population by highlighting the successes of women’s self-help groups in states such as Tamil Nadu.

Saumya Swaminathan, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research, emphasised the need for dietary diversity and absorption of nutrients, as over half of the Indian population is deficient in micronutrients. This is mainly because of a cereal-based diet. Carbohydrates account for over 80 percent of the diet along with small portions of fat. The bulk of the population is completely deficient in proteins and micronutrients. However, fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals are beyond the reach of most of the people in India who are poor. Access to a healthy diet that is rich in essential nutrients is necessary but not sufficient for better nutrition if the body is not able to absorb the nutrients. Often, young children, even from high-income households, get colonised by infections due to exposure to contaminated air and water.

The panel made the following recommendations. First, nutrition policies must take into account the role of social factors, particularly gender inequality. It will be next to impossible to address the challenge of undernutrition without addressing the key issues of early marriage, lack of control over child birth, and poor health of mothers. Most interventions must be targeted to two age groups: children between 0-1,000 days and adolescent girls. This is so because the first 1,000 days are crucial for the baby. Undernutrition during this period can have profound implications on the development of the child into a healthy adult. Similarly, it is important to target adolescent girls because they are likely to be the future mothers. Second, to address the issue of diabetes and micronutrient-deficiency, it is important to invest in improving nutrition literacy in India. Third, the basket under the public distribution system must be widened to include pulses, and processed fruits and vegetables to ensure dietary diversity. Last, linking agriculture to nutrition is critical. Farmers must be encouraged to produce nutritious crops and vegetable not only for the market but also for household consumption.



Equity through Accountability in the Health Sector: Towards UHC in India

Oommen C Kurian

Multi-sectoral convergence and integrated solutions considering regional specificities are needed in the health sector. To facilitate effective implementation in a situation of wide district-level disparities even within states, a performance-based categorisation of districts similar to what Karnataka has tried will be immensely useful. Availability and use of regular, good quality health data thus becomes a policy imperative. “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, the panel discussion organised in August 2017 by ORF and BMGF, explored issues of data in health and nutrition towards the SDGs.

Better data is needed for making a robust case for more state intervention in sectors like health and nutrition, and for harnessing the strengths of the well-entrenched private sector to achieve public health goals. In May 2016, the Health Secretaries of the States and Union Territories of India gathered in the capital and issued “The Delhi Commitment on Sustainable Development Goals for Health”. Among other measures, the document called for greater investments in health data collection, analysis and research. Given that the success of global SDGs over the next 15 years will largely depend on India’s performance, it is important to measure progress closely and ensure mid-course corrections when needed.

Real-time data flow will also have a major role to play in breaking the thick wall of suspicion that exists between the private and the public health sectors in India, given the inevitability of private sector engagement. After all, 70 percent of the population depends on the private sector for care. Data flow in itself can be a confidence building measure. High-quality data will be essential to ensure that the country’s health programmes hurdle the last mile. Huge unused bed strength in the private sector and long waiting lines in the public sector co-exist in India in secondary and tertiary healthcare, and a robust information infrastructure is a necessary condition for any solution that reconciles issues of financial and physical access using government’s bargaining power.

India has covered some ground in terms of streamlining its public-sector health information infrastructure. At present, as Graph 1 shows, 676 out of the 700 Indian districts regularly report public facility-level data to the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). Ninety-seven percent of Sub Centres, 94 percent of Primary Health Centres, and 85 percent of Community Health Centres submit regular health data. The quality of the HMIS data has improved over time, and some important information on improvements in equitable distribution of health infrastructure has become available.

Graph 1: HMIS Data Reporting from Public Hospitals: All India.

Over the last decade, a 65-percent increase in public health infrastructure in Adivasi areas was recorded, compared to the much lower 10-percent increase in non-Adivasi areas. Similarly, the gap in human resource availability in the public sector between Adivasi and non-Adivasi areas has come down in the last ten years from 21 percent to three percent. It is also known that immunisation coverage is improving rapidly for Adivasi areas in states like Odisha and Chhattisgarh, at a much higher rate than the respective state averages. Gender gap in under-5 mortality rate too, is narrowing down, noted Mr Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary & Mission Director, NHM, during the ORF-BMGF event.

The National Health Mission (NHM) is using data from diverse sources including HMIS to zero down on geographies and populations that need more attention, and high-priority districts thus identified within Empowered Action Group (EAG) states already receive per capita 1.3 times more funds than other districts. Quality and reliability of the HMIS data still remains a problem despite improvements; and on some parameters, the difference between HMIS estimate and a third-party survey estimate can be reportedly as wide as 50 percent. Underutilisation of other existing datasets like National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys remain a concern too.

India has not fully tapped into the potential that Information Technology (IT) offers to integrate the health information systems in the country. Notification of EHR standards was done to facilitate interoperability. The NHP 2017 has suggested that a national digital health authority will be responsible for developing common standards, notifying them, and to ensuring that there is buy-in from stakeholders. This is important, as the private sector, which provides care for almost 70 percent of the population is still mostly outside the purview of the national health information system. To overcome this binding constraint, a National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) is currently being rolled out.

Much of the health policy debate in India typically happens post-facto: not during or before decisionmaking. To enable focus on using data, resolution of structural issues on both supply and demand sides are required. Given the complexity of the systems and the multiple stakeholders involved, there is a need for transparency in the datasets behind policy decisions for the sake of open and democratic decisionmaking. A strong digital architecture will help address both the supply as well as demand level concerns.

The government is doing considerable work around e-Health information systems, according to Mr Ashish Sharma, Partner, Strategy&. The digital architecture will need to be open and inclusive so that the private sector participates voluntarily. In addition, it needs to be universally adoptable so that even if different stakeholders build components individually, these are built consistently and uniformly across the overall system.

The new health information infrastructure will also have to find ways of overcoming the inter-sectoral, inter-ministerial incoherence and inter-organisational incoherence in terms of numbers. Prof. Aasha Kapur Mehta of IIPA, New Delhi pointed out that, for example, while NITI Aayog’s three-year action agenda seeks to reduce MMR to 120 per 1 lakh live birth by 2020, the National Health Policy 2017 aims to decrease the MMR to 100 per 1 lakh live births by 2020. Therefore, India has two different targets for the same year for MMR. The Indian Statistical Service, which forms the backbone of the National Statistical System, needs to be reformed and overhauled, starting with the vital registration system.

The trained personnel who collect data have been one of the first to bear the brunt whenever there is a cut-back, and over time, this has had an impact on the quality of the data collected, particularly morbidity data. The administrative data on morbidity exists in hospitals, but are never compiled or analysed. As a votary of the open data initiative, India needs to find ways of organising existing data in the system in a manner that every stakeholder finds useful. Improved levels of standardisation at the point of data collection will facilitate data use, and policy discussions informed by relevant numbers.

India has a great opportunity: it has the resources, owing to the consistently high growth rate, freeing up for improving healthcare coverage for its population. Giving priority to health is an area where perhaps India can learn from China, according to Dr David Wilson, Global Lead for Decision & Delivery Science of the World Bank. The Chinese government had concluded that catastrophic health spending forced so many Chinese to save at such disproportionately high rates, to an extent that they could not consume and contribute to the rebalancing of China’s economy towards domestic consumption-led growth. China had a real economic reason to invest in universal health coverage, apart from equity. Given that India has a considerable proportion of its population falling under the poverty line every year because of healthcare spending, public health spending in India can be an investment for the future.

To make that investment meaningful, high-quality data is inevitable. India is planning to undertake an ambitious step towards UHC through the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), which will reportedly cover 70 percent of the Indian population. Ensuring a seamless transition from the existing RSBY to the proposed NHPS will require insights from the analysis of RSBY scheme data as well as survey data on impact. It is time for India to drop the much-discussed apprehension to programme evaluations and to liberate data being collected at institutions and by schemes including the RSBY data to facilitate independent evaluations.

Human Capital in the Knowledge Age: Investing in India’s Billion-Person Data Set

Samir Saran

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will prompt a tectonic shift in the way the world has traditionally organised economies. The Knowledge Age is giving way to a new barometer of economic aptitude – one that is predicated on possession of data and information, rather than the conventional advantages of cheap labour, or even coal and petroleum. This is because the ability of modern-day innovations, such as mobile supercomputing and machine learning, to enhance the way we live, work and exist is contingent on the consumption of data. In a context where data is the key to economic success, India is uniquely positioned to distinguish itself as a formidable actor. While data is regularly exchanged among developers, advertisers and consumers for services, its value is linked to the capabilities of the population it describes.

India is home to a young, billion-person community. Correspondingly, the country has the potential to access and develop a billion-point (1.3 billion to be precise) data set. Access to data of that scale is uncommon and generally monopolised by a handful of private stakeholders. In the United States, for example, the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) source and analyse the data of billions of diverse users on a daily basis. Similarly, in China, the BAT conglomerate (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) dominate the data collection market of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. India is the only country that has integrated data into its public infrastructure – the Aadhaar programme enables every resident of India to register for a unique biometric identification. With 1.18 billion Aadhaar enrollments, India is the largest country in the world with a unique digital identity.

The challenge for India, however, is to streamline systems to cultivate a data set that is educated, healthy and sustainable so that both the capacity of Indian citizens and the corresponding value of their data are strengthened. This re-conceptualisation of individuals essentially overturns India’s approach to human capital investment itself – where such investment is no longer viewed as an altruistic, social welfare enterprise, but instead as an economic imperative that is necessary to sustain the country’s rapidly expanding economy. Technology-based innovation has proved to be a successful social model in the past, and it can certainly be a remedy for the pervasive gap in services and skills that exists in Indian society today. If India is able to bridge this gap, it has the chance to possess a nearly unparalleled source of human capital and data that will catalyse the country’s growth for the foreseeable future.

Commodifying Human Capital

The state of the human will define the state of the economy. To reflect this reality, India will need to reshape its understanding of social services and investment. For nearly 50 years following independence, India’s economy was largely insulated. This meant that for years there was minimal external competition on its products, and in turn, on the quality of its labour force. Investments in health, education and skilling were therefore considered parallel social initiatives and rarely featured in the country’s growth strategies, if at all.

Today, however, in a global environment increasingly dependent on data, human capital investment serves both an economic and a social purpose. Simply put, human development and economic growth should be viewed as interdependent measures. To reflect this reality, India must turn towards technology-based solutions to develop a healthy and well-educated society and capitalise on its data set.

A Technology-Driven Framework for Investment

The digital platform presents India the opportunity to approach investment in human capital as a pragmatic, value-creating scheme that improves human knowledge and capacity. Where traditional social institutions have struggled, India’s expansive digital economy can assume an efficient and cost-effective service-delivery mandate. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme is a classic example of this potential. In an effort to streamline the way subsidy benefits were handed out, the government cut out the middleman and began depositing subsidies directly into eligible citizens’ bank accounts. The result? An overwhelming decrease in subsidy scams, duplication and service-delays, which also saved the government some INR 50,000 crore.

Digital innovation for the bottom of the pyramid changes the approach to public goods delivery altogether – from a supply-driven mechanism to a more effective demand-driven one. In public institutions, if app-based programmes provided education and health coupons directly to beneficiaries instead of the institutions themselves, schools and hospitals would be forced to compete for customers, at least in urban and peri-urban settings. It would also allow communities to establish self-arranged solutions and mitigate governance or accessibility issues.

Investment through digital innovation can also ensure a greater level of oversight at the state and local level. Through decentralised programmes, customised by state and locality, digital applications can source baseline data regarding health and education indicators, starting with civil registration and vital statistics. This initiative would create a real-time monitoring system of states’ progress in human development. A subsequent system could develop based off of this data that incentivises or rewards states that successfully improve their human development capacities.

Similar to how governments invested in the steam engine during the First Industrial Revolution or in financial systems during the rise of Wall Street, in this age, the Indian government can find value through investment in the health and education of its growing labour force. As the investments in social services materialise, India’s human development capacity will expand, leading to more qualified participants in the labour market and a more sophisticated set of available data. For India, in the Knowledge Age, its prospects for economic growth and power will be inextricably tied to innovations in technology, data and human capital investment.

‘Faces of the SDGs’ highlights passionate individuals from the produce sector with their own personal Sustainable Development Goal, as part of the Netherlands-based company’s efforts to encourage greater uptake of the SDG challenge throughout the supply chain.

During the Fruit Logistica and Biofach trade fairs in February, Eosta shot the first of a series of portraits of produce professionals with specially-designed SDG cubes; each giving participants the option to choose their preferred goal from a total of 17.

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals framework was adopted by all member countries of the UN, with the aim of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030.

Although former secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged governments to “take the lead with decisive steps,” at the same time he called on businesses to “provide essential solutions and resources that put our world on a more sustainable path”.

Michaël Wilde, sustainability & communications manager at Eosta, said: “We want to take the SDGs out of the theoretical policy space and move them firmly into the commercial environment where economy meets ecology. We hope to create more awareness for these goals both within and outside the produce sector.

“Giving people the possibility to choose their most important goal out of the 17 takes them out of their role as a buyer, farmer or trader,"" he added. ""It creates room for a different kind of conversation about the future of our planet and everyone’s personal role in working towards a cleaner and fairer world.""

Eosta is one of the first companies in the fresh food industry to have actively incorporated SDGs into its current business model. The UN goals have been thoroughly studied and connected to the indicators of the company’s ‘Sustainability Flower,’ an assessment and transparency model developed and used by the company.



The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals form part of the organisation’s sustainable development agenda, with each goal comprising targets to be achieved over a 15-year period.

Goal 12 – ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns – is of particular relevance to the global fresh produce sector. However, Eosta estimates that close to ten further Sustainable Development Goals would be impacted positively if the sector began farm more responsibly.","Eosta, the organic fruit and vegetable marketer and campaigner for fairer practices in agriculture, has announced the launch of the ‘Faces of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’ campaign; an initiative aimed at raising awareness of UN SDGs across the fresh produce sector.

43,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-paul-apostle-of-christ,"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Paul, Apostle of Christ’","Jim Caviezel co-stars as St. Luke the Evangelist in Affirm Films’ drama about the last days of St. Paul and the struggles of the Roman Christian community in the days of Nero.

“I expected more,” muses Mauritius, the Roman prefect of the Mamertine Prison, critically eying the frail, bald-headed, bewhiskered prisoner standing unsteadily before him.

Perhaps Mauritius is looking for some sign of the charisma and commanding presence that would mark a powerful leader of an infamous cult blamed for burning half the city — or possibly something to warrant the rumors of the prisoner’s supernatural powers and otherworldly character.

Either way, Mauritius wouldn’t have been the first to be less than impressed by the unimposing figure cut by Paul of Tarsus. (Per 2 Corinthians 10:10, Paul seems to have had a rap for being less powerful in person than his mighty letters would suggest.)

The year is A.D. 67, about a dozen years into the notorious reign of Nero, widely deemed responsible for the Great Fire of Rome and said to have scapegoated Rome’s Christian community, not just for the fire, but for hatred of humanity.

For this they were tortured and executed in heinous ways, including being nailed to crosses and set ablaze at night. (The depiction of the persecution is drawn from the Roman historian Tacitus; an opening title tacitly supports the late folk etymology of Nero’s human pyrotechnics giving rise to the term “Roman candle.”)

Paul, Apostle of Christ offers a compelling account the last days of St. Paul — played with gravel-voiced authority by James Faulkner (Game of Thrones; X-Men: First Class) — in a dungeon in the Mamertine Prison, facing execution for treason. It’s not the unmade epic about the life of Paul of Tarsus many would like to see, but what it is is worthwhile in its own right.

Writer-director Andrew Hyatt (Full of Grace) interweaves Paul’s story with two secondary story strands, one concerning Rome’s underground Christian community and the other involving the prefect Mauritius (Olivier Martinez) and his family.

Tying the story strands together is Paul’s old traveling companion, Luke the physician (Jim Caviezel). St. Luke slips quietly into Rome to visit Paul in prison and to bring from him some word of encouragement and guidance to the Roman Christians and the larger Christian world, in the process becoming entangled with Mauritius and his family.

The most dramatically and thematically interesting material emerges from the agonized deliberations of the Roman Christians under the de facto leadership of the missionary couple Priscilla and Aquila (Joanne Whalley and John Lynch), who are companions and fellow workers of Paul (mentioned as such several times in the New Testament).

Conflicting impulses divide the community: Should they remain in Rome, as light in the darkness? Should they seek a warmer welcome elsewhere? Or should they join other Romans opposed to Nero and oppose his tyranny by fighting fire with fire?

Even Priscilla and Aquila are split on whether to stay or go; there are no clear answers here. As for the question of fighting, when speaking to the community Luke strenuously repudiates this as contrary to the way and teaching of Christ — but when he talks to Paul about the horrors inflicted on the believers, he finds his conviction wavering. Though decisively rejected, the prospect and the plausibility of violence in the name of Christ is treated with a level of complexity welcome in such a film.

All of this means trouble at work for Mauritius; there’s also trouble at home. His wife, Irenica (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), is anxious about their daughter’s dangerous illness and worried that her husband may have incurred the wrath of the gods through lack of devotion — or deference toward his sectarian prisoner.

The prospect of a brutal but thoughtful pagan official with a seriously ill family member in a film like this raises the distinct possibility of a miraculous cure and a dramatic conversion. In Paul, Apostle of Christ, these possibilities are actually floated onscreen, which again suggests that the filmmakers may be thinking at least somewhat outside the box.

The conversations between Luke and Paul, which eventually lead to the sequel to Luke’s Gospel, the Acts of the Apostles, form the central arc. Paul recounts vignettes from his life to flashbacks of his early religious training and murderous opposition to what he sees as the heresy of Jesus' followers to his shattering Damascus Road encounter with Jesus Christ and his healing encounter with Ananias.

Luke and Paul have a comfortable relationship easing at times into good-natured banter, though it’s clear that Luke regards the “Old Man” with a species of awe, since everything Luke knows of Jesus has been mediated through Paul’s life and preaching.

If anything troubles Paul, it’s the weight of trauma he still carries from his early crimes as a persecutor of the Church. The stoning of Stephen (André Agius), the killing of a Christian child and other enormities weigh on him, heightened by visions in which he sees his victims standing silently as if bearing mute witness against him. The wordless resolution of this theme is perhaps the film’s most memorable and effective stroke.

Hyatt uses impressionistic slow motion for these visionary sequences, blended with flashback memories, breaking up what is otherwise a largely conversational film shot mostly in dimly lit interiors penetrated by atmospheric beams of light. (The most striking lighting effect involves a pagan offering made to a Roman deity — perhaps Asclepius, the god of medicine — represented as a vast disc-shaped visage like Rome’s famous Bocca della Verità, with bright beams blazing from its eyeholes like laser vision, ready to smite unworthy worshippers.)

At times the nonlinear storytelling leads to some ambiguity regarding the timeline. Some viewers might be confused by a reference in a closing scene to Paul’s two years under house arrest (with which the Book of Acts concludes). The reference is to Paul’s first Roman arrest before the Great Fire, a much less serious affair. (What’s especially tricky is that Paul’s surroundings in this scene are consistent with a house arrest, but the lodgings are not his own and two years don’t pass in the last minutes of the film.)

One oddity is the absence, even in dialogue, of other apostles, notably Peter, whose martyrdom in Rome is generally thought to have coincided closely with Paul’s. Presumably Peter would have been imprisoned like Paul or else with the underground Christian community, yet there’s no mention of him.

Hyatt is Catholic, so the silence about Peter in Rome — or even Linus and Clement, among his first successors as bishops of Rome — seems an odd missed opportunity. (On a subtle note, all the Roman Christian men have beards, which suggests that they’re probably mostly Jewish Christians with an occasional Greek like Luke. I would have liked to see a few clean-shaven Latin faces.)

Shot on a budget and a tight schedule in Malta (where Gladiator and Troy, and more recently Risen, were shot), Paul, Apostle of Christ is remarkably authentic-looking. The screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful, with only occasional missteps, ranging from an occasional poorly chosen phrase (like Luke’s “thoughts and prayers”) to a late moment in which a character who has suffered a trauma more dangerous than Paul’s floggings is up and about far too quickly.

Paul, Apostle of Christ is dedicated to all who have been persecuted for their faith. This potentially raises a sticky point.

Jesus warned Christians to expect persecution, and from his own crucifixion until today the Church has never been without opposition. Today, in fact, Christians around the world are being persecuted as never before. Yet at times the memory or idea of persecution has outstripped the reality.

After the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, Christians often looked back on the early centuries of the Church as a period of constant, ferocious persecution by one Roman emperor after another. In reality, with notable exceptions (including the persecutions of Nero and especially Diocletian), persecution was generally sporadic, haphazard and not state-sponsored. (Some skeptical historians have even questioned the Neronian persecution, though its historicity is accepted by most scholars.)

In our day, global persecution notwithstanding, American Christians are generally far less aggrieved than many of us are inclined to think. It’s easy to imagine many comfortable viewers watching Paul, Apostle of Christ as if it were not only a story of our heritage, and one that resonates with the experiences of suffering souls around the world, but a mirror of our own experience.

On the other hand, the film’s clear repudiation of violence in the name of Christ, its repudiation of efforts to seize the reins of power by any means necessary, and its theme of seeing enemies as human beings are especially welcome today. Sometimes in the effort to resist evil one risks becoming what one opposes, or worse. Paul, Apostle of Christ suggests that it’s always better to suffer evil than to be brought to its level in resisting it.

Canada is slated to present its VNR on progress in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in July 2018, during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Noting Canada’s commitment to build a more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world as envisioned by the SDGs, the press release states that the Canadian Federal Government will: reach out to all Canadians to develop a national strategy to catalyze nationwide SDG implementation; work with partners to raise awareness and build partnerships and networks; establish an SDG team to support integrating the SDGs into policies and programs of federal departments and agencies; continue to contribute to the UN’s SDG Indicator Framework; and present its first VNR.

To develop the VNR, the release further announces the launch of a VNR Web Portal allowing Canadians to contribute to the report’s development. Organizations and communities are invited to provide “snapshots” of their work towards “a more sustainable and prosperous future,” including information on efforts focusing on specific SDGs, measuring progress towards achieving those goals, and innovative approaches related to sustainable development. A selection of the submissions received will be used as contributions to the VNR or may be featured as examples of SDG implementation in the report. The portal will be open for contributions submitted online or by email until 4 May 2018.

Several events and publications during the first half of 2018 are expected to contribute to Canada’s review of progress and its VNR, including the following:

In April, the Brookings Institution released a working paper titled, “A Canadian North Star: Crafting an advanced economy approach to the Sustainable Development Goals.” The report identifies which issues in Canada are “on track” for success and which issues require a “breakthrough,” and provides recommendations regarding the roles of different groups of actors.

On 24 April 2018, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development of the Auditor General of Canada presented the 2018 Spring Reports, including a report on Canada’s Preparedness to implement the SDG. The report represents the first national audit of a country’s preparedness to implement, monitor and report on SDG progress following a framework developed by the International Office of Supreme Audit Organizations (INTOSAI).

An audit of biodiversity conservation in Canada was also released as part of the Commissioner’s 2018 Spring Reports. This report examines whether Environment and Climate Change Canada provided national leadership and coordination to conserve Canada’s biodiversity, and whether responsible federal departments and agencies were working to meet selected biodiversity conservation targets. Progress in conserving biodiversity will be reviewed in depth at the HLPF in July 2018 as part of its review of progress on SDG 15 (Life on Land).

In May 2018, Statistics Canada is expected to launch an indicator portal to track SDG implementation at the national level. The portal is expected to provide access to indicator data that is aligned with, comparable, or complementary to the indicators proposed by the UN’s SDG Indicator Framework.

Several SDGs are also reflected in the themes Canada has chosen for its presidency of the G7. The G7 Summit, to be held 8-9 June 2018, in Charlevoix, Canada will focus on, among other issues: gender equality and women’s empowerment, contributing to SDG 5 (gender equality); working together on climate change, oceans and clean energy, contributing to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy for all), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water); growth that works for everyone and preparing for jobs of the future, contributing to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); and building a more peaceful and secure world, contributing to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

To track action for SDG implementation in Canada, a group of NGOs has just launched the Alliance2030 Portal, which will function as a searchable database of the work undertaken in Canada in alignment with the SDGs, including through news posts, storytelling, blogs and podcasts.

Addressing lessons learned about investment, Cristina Duarte, Cabo Verde’s Former Minister of Finances, Planning and Public Administration, noted that building institutions and regulatory systems conducive to investment can take 10-15 years, and it requires policy coherence and integration. Admasu Nebebe, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Finance and Economic Cooperation, spoke about the importance of investing in human development, noting that Ethiopia is currently investing 25% of its national budget in education. He observed that Ethiopia is the country with the third-largest public investment in infrastructure, which he said is also essential for attracting private investment.

The acting mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, said the local government has collaborated with the national bank of Colombia to develop a strategy to target extreme poverty eradication and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Sergio Londoño Zurek, who is also the Director General of the Presidential Cooperation Agency (APC-Colombia), also reported that 55,000 people live in extreme poverty in his city.

Anne Simpson, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), observed that the SDGs bring benefits for pension funds because they address risks. She said that after the 2008 financial crisis, CalPERS decided to rethink investment in terms of long-term value creation, and concluded that it needs to manage three types of capital: financial; human; and natural. As these three types of capital are also addressed by the SDGs, she said, the Goals are great for the sustainable investments that funds must harness in order to pay pensions.

Simpson moderated a series of presentations on successful PPPs in Kenya, Nigeria and Brazil. Ormat Olkaria III (Kenya) – the first privately funded and developed geothermal plant in Africa – reflects the importance of successful risk allocation between the private sector and public sector in achieving efficiency. The project was funded through two separate rounds of equity and debt financing, resulting in profits for the private investor and a decrease in energy costs for consumers.

Among the ingredients that led to the project’s success, Paul Mbuthi, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, noted the government’s focus on removing barriers to investment such as tariffs, as well as shouldering the high costs of the first explorations. Nachman Isaac, Ormat, explained what makes projects bankable and thus prone to success: long-term power purchase agreements; strong sovereign support, including support letters from the government; strong existing provisions that guarantee the recovery of a sufficient part of the investment; international arbitration; stable and predictable regulatory frameworks; and risk sharing.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) – OLAM Farmers Partnership (Nigeria) provides smallholder rice farmers with access to a profitable and reliable market, and OLAM with a consistent source of high quality produce. The project leverages multilateral financing from IFAD to attract funding from a large multinational firm (OLAM) to provide a consistent source of income to small-scale farmers, which, in turn, should lead to increased capital investment by the small-scale farmers. Odoemena Benjamin, IFAD, said multilateral agencies can help governments catalyze the necessary resources for projects aligned with national needs and priorities.

The Renewable Energy Market and Pacific Hydro Wind Farms (Brazil) was financed by a national development bank, and shows that private infrastructure investment can be successful even without financing and/or guarantees from international lenders. Based on the success of this project, Pacific Hydro is currently pursuing several much larger renewable energy projects in Brazil, illustrating how smaller investments can spur larger-scale, long-term investments.

The panel discussions were followed by thematic parallel working groups on ‘Large-scale, Capital- intensive Infrastructure,’ ‘New Investment Opportunities in Agriculture,’ and ‘Innovative Financial Instruments to support the SDGs.’

47,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/delegates-debate-scope-of-migration-compact/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Delegates Debate Scope of Migration Compact,"6 April 2018: Delegates debated the root causes of migration that the Global Compact on Migration should address, whether the text should include new commitments, as well as whether to emphasize the non-legally binding nature of the document. Many supported a strong focus on children and the gender dimension of migration, with Australia calling to also add reference to people with disabilities. This third round of intergovernmental negotiations on the Compact convened from 3-6 April 2018, in New York, US.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference to convene from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico.

While Jamaica noted that all migration brings positive development outcomes, Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and China said that, when mentioning the positive role of migration in development, the text needs to read “regular” migration.

Many countries, including Austria, for a group of 27 European States, Norway and Australia, welcomed the stronger language of the revised draft on human rights and the protection of vulnerable migrants. Russia said the strong language on human rights is not justified.

Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Austria for a group of 27 European States, Norway, and Mexico welcomed strengthening the gender dimension of migration in the text.

Comoros, for the African Group, and Ethiopia stressed that the root causes of migration such as poverty and development would require the implementation of projects in countries of origin, thus call for a new, separate objective and actionable area on international cooperation on financial support for countries of origin to implement projects that address the root causes of migration, as well as for a special fund and a capacity building mechanism. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, expressed concern that the language on root causes of migration – such as corruption, access to justice, respect of human rights, good governance, rule of law, and strong civil society – has been reduced. South Africa noted that conflict as root cause would be better placed in the Global Compact on Refugees, while in the Global Compact on Migration, the root cause should be underdevelopment and addressed through, inter alia: infrastructure development; market access; investment in agriculture; technology transfer; investment in education and training; and respecting official development assistance (ODA) commitments.

Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, said paragraph 39 of the revised draft, which recognizes “the discretion of all States to determine their national legislation and policies with regards to the implementation of the actions envisaged in this Global Compact” is problematic as it leaves it to the discretion of the Member States to implement the actionable commitments and weakens an already nonbinding document. China insisted on changing the term “actionable commitments” in “policy options and best practices,” explaining that the Compact should not create new commitments for Member States. Brazil stressed that the sovereignty of the State is not absolute, but it is limited by international law. Thus, States are sovereign to decide who are irregular and regular migrants, within the parameters of international law. Japan called for flexibility in implementation and follow-up. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia warned against using prescriptive language in the text, suggesting “should” or “could” instead of “must” or “commit.”

Several countries, including the African Group, Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, Tuvalu, and the Holy See welcomed the inclusion of reference to migrants affected by the slow onset of climate displacement in the document. Nauru, for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (P-SIDS), said the Compact should include calls for the international community to plan for the management and support of climate-related migration. Ethiopia said climate change and natural disasters should be approached as root causes and addressed under each objective and actionable area. Canada called for adding language on climate migration in the Guiding Principles section. China said climate change causes refugees and not migrants, thus it should be addressed in the Global Compact for Refugees. Russia requested the deletion of references to the Paris Agreement on climate change and to the UN Convention to Combat Diversification (UNCCD).

The African Group and the Holy See called for the abolishment of migration detention camps and detention of migrants. Pakistan noted that the draft focuses too much on drivers of migration in countries of origin and too little on creating opportunities in destination countries. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia called for emphasizing the duty of nations to accept the return of their nationals, consistent with human rights law.

Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, called for measures to support family reintegration and for legal pathways for low-skilled families to migrate with their children. The need to protect migrant children was also emphasized by Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, and Bangladesh, Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Guatemala, Turkey, Venezuela, Norway, Mexico, Panama and the Republic of Moldova.

On implementation and follow-up and review, Austria for a group of 27 European States, expressed hope to receive a proposal on the capacity building mechanism, information on the financial implications of the proposals in the text, as well as clarifications of who are the actors involved in each of the proposals (States regions, the UN, stakeholders).

Several countries, including China and Russia, requested clear emphasis in the text on the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. Bangladesh and Uganda stressed that references that the document is not legally binding makes the text weak.

The next round of negotiations will take place from 14-18 May 2018 in New York, US.

The NAP Expo aimed to discuss country experiences, best practices, lessons learned, gaps and needs, and information on support provided and received in relation to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. It also offered a platform for countries to interact with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and others providing support for NAPs, as a means to improve access to financing for NAPs.

The event convened amidst alarm bells sounded by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who called for “a race to the top – with political will, innovation, financing and partnership” to counter “the most systemic threat to humankind” that is climate change. [Opening Remarks at Press Encounter on Climate Change by UN Secretary General António Guterres] [UNFCCC Press Release]

Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under NDCs.

The urgent need for adaptation action in light of the “relentless pace of climate change” is reflected in recent updates from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO confirmed the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to be among the most destructive on record, with damage costs exceeding US$250 billion in the US alone, and March 2018 to be the third warmest on record. [WMO Press Release on 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season] [WMO Press Release on March 2018]

The main topics of NAP Expo 2018 were: systematic observations, monitoring and evaluation, and learning from experience from past climate shocks; assessing vulnerability and risk; designing implementation strategies while taking into account vertical and horizontal integration, and different pathways over time; and financial support for the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

Areas of adaptation addressed at the Expo included: climate information services (CIS), climate data and scenarios; monitoring and evaluation; linkages among adaptation, the SDGs and disaster risk reduction (DRR); consideration of gender in NAPs; lessons learned from the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs); long-term adaptation planning and transformation; adaptation in the agriculture sector; water crises and other climate shocks; adaptation in human settlements; and applying traditional and indigenous knowledge. Emerging topics such as big data and artificial intelligence were also discussed.

NAP Expo 2018 was the fifth consecutive NAP Expo, organized by the UNFCCC Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) in collaboration with various organizations.

The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF) in 2010. Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The process is supported by the LEG and though initiatives such as the NAP Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) and the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs Programme (NAP-Ag). NAP-GSP is a joint programme by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to assist developing countries to advance NAPs. NAP-Ag, carried out jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and UNDP, focuses on climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector.

49,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/parties-provide-inputs-to-talanoa-dialogue/,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Parties Provide Inputs to Talanoa Dialogue,"2 April 2018: Since January 2018, the Talanoa Dialogue Platform has been receiving submissions from UNFCCC Parties and non-Party stakeholders on the three questions of the Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This summary provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received from Parties regarding the three questions.

Inputs that were submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Party submissions thus far include those from Australia, China, Ethiopia, the EU, Fiji, Indonesia, Norway, Palestine, Saint Lucia for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group. Input has also been provided by Switzerland, Costa Rica, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden, supported by Monaco.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), many of the submissions concede that current emission trajectories and policies are at odds with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The CARICOM submission reiterates support for the global average temperature rise to remain below 1.5°C, given that climate change impacts are already being experienced in the region with lower warming levels. It laments that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not yet on a pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The submission states that CARICOM countries’ economic and physical survival is already being threatened, and their adaptive capacity challenged or potentially exceeded. It warns that the observed temperature change in the region is greater than the global average stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea level has risen by around 20 centimeters over the past 100 years, and heat waves are already impacting ecosystems. [Report of CARICOM Workshop on IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C and Talanoa Dialogue] [Caribbean Marine Climate Change Report Card 2017] [US Global Change Research Program’s Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary]

China’s submission underscores that efforts to address climate change are inadequate, and notes “huge gaps” in pre-2020 mitigation ambition and action. It indicates that: developing countries are still facing financial difficulties and barriers in delivering climate actions; greenhouse gases (GHGs) are still rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere; and good practices and opportunities regarding mitigation, adaptation and international cooperation have been identified through through the Technical Examination Process on mitigation (TEP-M) and adaptation (TEP-A).

Fiji’s submission discusses, inter alia: political will and effective policymaking, including the Fijian Government’s introduction of innovative green fiscal measures to stimulate investments and economic growth in a range of sectors; successful mitigation initiatives, including solar home systems, a renewable energy revolving fund and solar islands; and Fiji’s progress on adaptation in the housing, transport, agriculture, energy, health and education sectors.

The Arab Group’s submission laments inadequate funding flows to developing countries, including for the transition to more climate-friendly technologies. It states that a carbon market with carbon pricing should not be considered as a source of funding or as a catalyst for action, and describes the adverse impacts of response measures in many developing countries, particularly those that are heavily dependent on a single sector or commodity.

The EU’s submission confirms that the EU is set to surpass its goal of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, and that the EU 2030 climate and energy framework will lead to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030; noting that the reduction target has been translated into a legislative framework that will ensure objectives are met. It also describes, inter alia, the EU’s share of global emissions, its specific mitigation efforts, and governance and an ongoing review of energy and climate policies in the EU.

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), the CARICOM submission reaffirms that 1.5°C mitigation pathways are the only way forward, and highlights that regional efforts are underway to provide detailed assessments of the impacts of 1.5°C warming. It states that CARICOM expects scientific evidence presented through the Talanoa Dialogue to highlight the need for more ambitious, updated NDCs by 2020 to enable vulnerable communities, such as those in small island developing States (SIDS), to survive.

China’s submission calls for climate targets to be aligned with the SDGs, and for global climate goals to be equitable, taking into account the principle of common but differential responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).

The EU stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.

The Arab Group’s submission supports a regime that acknowledges differing circumstances between developed and developing countries. It notes that the level of developing country actions directly relates to the level of developed country support, and highlights the need for adequate, predictable and sustainable means of implementation for developing countries to implement their NDCs and build resilience.

Underscoring the aim of collectively meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the temperature and long-term mitigation goals, the EU’s submission states that the EU’s NDC and its domestic mitigation targets are consistent with reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. It notes that the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) will provide clarity on the scale of the challenge to meeting the temperature goal, and on how this compares to the 2°C goal. The submission also discusses the need for creating enabling environments for transitioning to low emission development pathways, and progress made by various EU countries on such transition.

How do we get there?

On the third question (How do we get there?), submissions discuss various actions required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. China’s submission underscores the need to, inter alia, encourage technology innovation and enabling policies to promote an “energy revolution,” and accelerate structural changes in the economy to decouple emissions and economic growth. It calls for stimulating climate-friendly lifestyles, and providing developing countries with adequate financial, technological and capacity building resources for mitigation and adaptation actions.

In its submission, Fiji calls attention to the need for: adequate, predictable and sustainable finance for mitigation efforts; innovative climate finance; development of institutional capacity; access to technology; overcoming economies of scale; and enhancing national carbon sequestration. It also explains that Fiji will adopt “no regrets” adaptation measures, which include: better management of natural resources, particularly of coastal habitats, land and water; disease vector control; and improved spatial planning.

The Arab Group’s submission recommends, inter alia: ensuring that equity and CBDR are implemented across the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP); considering the impacts of the implementation of response measures and removing barriers that may hinder technology development and transfer; establishing a clear process for monitoring progress and reporting of financial support; and ensuring that the provision of funding achieves a balance between adaptation and mitigation.

The EU’s submission highlights the EU’s ongoing work on a proposed strategy for meeting the long-term Paris goals to be presented by the first quarter of 2019, noting that all its member States will develop national low-carbon mid-century strategies. The submission stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). It describes, among others, the EU policy framework for domestic action and preparing for enhanced action, and sectoral opportunities and policies to enable the transition. The submission outlines the EU’s assistance to other countries in transitioning towards low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways; and, stressing the need for a just transition, calls for mitigation action by and with non-Party actors.

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The project has reached around 30,000 people.

UNFG also hosts an annual youth event, which focuses on urban agriculture, resilience, community engagement and food security, and aims to ensure that the voices of youth are heard in implementation of the SDGs. In northern summer 2018, UNFG will launch a partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) to showcase equipment used by small-scale farmers in the field, highlighting the importance of technological innovation to promote food security.

These guiding questions fall under each of the three overarching questions of the Talanoa Dialogue process: Where are we? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there?

The May intersessional Talanoa Dialogue, which will be the first opportunity for Party and non-Party stakeholders to interact in a “constructive and non-judgmental” manner, will include plenary sessions and three working group sessions addressing the three overarching questions. Responses to questions will provide the foundation for ministerial discussions at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. Ministers will consider key messages from the preparatory phase in the form of a synthesis report, along with a complementary Yearbook of Global Climate Action.

Regarding the first overarching question (Where are we?), additional guiding questions address, inter alia: main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, current and future trends, and underlying drivers; existing legal and policy frameworks for addressing climate change, and whether they adequately address climate goals; successes and barriers regarding current initiatives; best practices, business models, and available technologies and anticipated costs; response of the financial sector; successful partnerships with governments; and the role of women, local communities, indigenous peoples and youth in transitioning to low-emission and carbon-resilient societies.

At COP 24, ministers will consider key messages from the Talanoa Dialogue’s preparatory phase in the form of a synthesis report, along with a complementary Yearbook of Global Climate Action.

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), guiding questions address, inter alia: short-term and long-term visions for climate resilience and for balancing emissions and removals post-2050; required scientific evidence for such visions; near-term scope for increasing national ambition; and technology barriers preventing specific sectors to respond to climate change and how to overcome them.

On the third question (How do we get there?), guiding questions address, among others: legal, policy and fiscal frameworks required for the short-term and long-term visions; required technological advancements and developments by sector; investment levels and sources; the role of the of the financial sector, and external and internal reforms and incentives to accelerate capital flows; and the role of the UNFCCC.

The UNFCCC has also provided information on how all stakeholders can participate in the Talanoa Diaogue process. They can do so by: submitting written input to the Talanoa Dialogue portal; expressing interest to be part of an in-person Talanoa discussion during the Bonn Climate Change Conference; and fostering a broader conversation by, for example, holding or participating in a “regional Talanoa” or putting out a “call to action” through social media. The COP 23 Presidency and the UNFCCC Secretariat are also holding a series of webinars on the preparation of inputs.

The preparatory phase of the Talanoa Dialogue will enable countries and non-Party stakeholders to contribute ideas, recommendations and information that can accelerate climate action to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change and support the SDGs. It will provide the foundation for the Talanoa Dialogue’s political phase.

The Dialogue, launched by the COP 23 Fijian Presidency at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn in November 2017, aims to promote enhanced ambition and will consider pre-2020 efforts by Parties on action and support. The UNFCCC Secretariat has established a Talanoa Dialogue portal to help countries and other stakeholders engage in the process. Talanoa is a concept from the Pacific that describes an inclusive, non-confrontational space for collective problem solving.

The note describes the general trends and contents of inputs, categorized according to the three questions of the Talanoa Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there?

The note, which synthesizes inputs received before 2 April 2018, is intended to facilitate Talanoa Dialogue discussions that will take place in parallel with the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The overview will be updated prior to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC, convening in Katowice, Poland, from 3-14 December, to capture inputs submitted by 29 October.

A total of 220 inputs met the 2 April deadline and were uploaded to the Talanoa Dialogue platform. Some answer all three questions, while others answer only one or two. 49 Parties submitted 15 inputs, including seven individual Parties and eight groups of Parties. The rest of the inputs are from non-Party stakeholders, including civil society, academia, research organizations, the private sector, subnational governments, international organizations and UN bodies.

Many inputs call for development paths that are just, inclusive, and consistent with human rights and equity.

Most of the inputs call for “wider and deeper” collaboration and partnerships, and say that the scale and pace of climate action must increase “dramatically and immediately” at the international, national and subnational levels. At the international level, inputs reflect the need for, inter alia, more ambitious and robust Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020, delivering on pre-2020 actions and a strong rule book for the Paris Agreement on climate change. At the national and subnational levels, inputs underscore the need to establish legal, policy, regulatory, fiscal, governance and investment frameworks to remove barriers, create incentives and mobilize broad action. Finance is a recurrent issue across all three questions, focusing on assessments of current finance levels or estimates of what is required to meet climate goals.

Many inputs refer to the moral dimension of climate change, and call for transitions and development paths that are just and inclusive, and consistent with human rights and equity. Some point to consequences from failing to fully apply the polluter-pays principle, and the benefits of policies like carbon pricing and phasing out perverse subsidies.

Highlighting synergies between climate action and sustainable development, inputs discuss links between meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. On resilience and adaptation, inputs highlight links between the Paris Agreement’s goals and those of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).

A total of 107 inputs address the first question (Where are we?), describing findings on greenhouse gases (GHGs) at the global, national or sectoral scale, setting out the state of play on climate impacts and vulnerability, showcasing initiatives and actions, and analyzing existing institutional arrangements.

A total of 114 inputs address the second question (Where do we want to go?), identifying aspirations in terms of global goals and principles for climate action, outlining emissions scenarios and trajectories compatible with goals, describing a future vision towards a zero-emissions world and climate resilience, outlining the stakeholders’ vision and ambition for themselves; and setting out expectations regarding future institutional arrangements.

A total of 148 inputs address the third question (How do we get there?), showcasing existing action on the ground that is achieving results and may be replicated and/or scaled-up, sharing knowledge on high-potential solutions, including technologies and collaboration models that may help accelerate climate action, and making recommendations for the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Convention bodies on issues to be addressed in international climate negotiations. They also make recommendations for national government action to ensure progress towards achieving the vision and ambition outlined in question 2, and for the private sector and intergovernmental organizations.

The May Talanoa Dialogue arrangements include an opening meeting on 2 May, in-depth discussion of the three questions on 6 May, a report-back meeting on 8 May and a closing meeting on 9 May.

54,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/non-party-stakeholders-provide-inputs-to-the-talanoa-dialogue/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Non-Party Stakeholders Provide Inputs to the Talanoa Dialogue,"2 April 2018: Since January 2018, the Talanoa Dialogue Platform has been receiving submissions from UNFCCC Parties as well as non-Party stakeholders on the three focal questions of the Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This article provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received before the 2 April deadline from non-Party stakeholders.

Inputs submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The online portal will remain open for submissions throughout the year. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), most submissions demonstrate that current emission trajectories and policies are not in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, highlighting that impacts of climate change are already being felt, while also emphasizing positive actions that are already being taken by various actors but which need to be scaled up. A submission from UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) underlines that current national climate plans – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – would almost deplete the carbon dioxide budget for a 2°C scenario by 2030, and far exceed the 1.5°C budget. It underscores that more ambitious NDCs will be necessary by 2020, building on the existing extensive knowledge about cost-effective policies and measures that can be taken. Analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) of a range of studies shows that, even if fully implemented, current NDCs would lead to between 2.7-3.7ºC of warming.

The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) submission takes the assessment a step further, applying an equity lens to the NDCs of 32 Parties, representing 80% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing whether each NDC represents a fair contribution or not. The CAT findings show that not only are global efforts insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but furthermore, the majority of NDCs assessed were found to be inconsistent with the CAT criteria of a fair contribution. According to the submission, only seven governments of the 32 reviewed have implemented 1.5ºC or 2ºC targets, four of which, it claims, are not backed up by sufficient policy action. The CAT submission also shows that currently implemented policies are expected to result in a further growth of global GHG emissions by about 9-13% between 2020-2030.

A submission from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) considers the finance aspects of the current state of play, noting that while climate-related funding is increasing, it is not growing quickly enough to keep the world on a 2ºC pathway.

Many of the inputs also make note of the climate change impacts being felt already. ActionAid International’s submission, on behalf of the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance (CLARA), highlights the “irremediable impacts” the world is already seeing due to the current overall “lock-in” of 1ºC of warming, including the loss of human development potential, negative impacts on livelihoods, and damage to ecosystem integrity caused by climate change and inappropriate land-use purposes and practices.

Actions being taken by private actors also form the basis of several submissions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) submission provides an overview of positive change and commitments undertaken by investors, including: globally, the share of low-carbon supply-side energy investments grew by six percentage points to 43% from 2014-2016; over 50 investors have signed a statement of support for the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and investors holding US$28 trillion in assets under management have signed on to Climate Action 100+, a collaborative five-year global initiative committing investor signatories to engage actively with the world’s top emitting companies. A submission from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that over 350 companies have committed to setting science-based targets, which are absolute GHG emissions reductions in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C. However, while these actions demonstrate a positive direction, the IIGCC submission underscores that the existing action could and should be scaled up, noting the need for governments to set the right enabling policy frameworks, including clear, long-term legislative programmes it highlights as “critical to the ability of investors to assess and manage climate-related risks and to invest in opportunities that support a low carbon, more energy efficient and climate-resilient world.”

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), many of the submissions highlight the emissions reductions and mitigation actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the adaptation and resilience actions required to ensure a safe future. In line with the official mandate of the Talanoa Dialogue, many submissions refer specifically to the long-term goal reflected in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, outlining the need to phase-out net GHG emissions in the second half of the century at the latest, achieve peak emissions in all sectors – energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture – by 2020, and consider the overall carbon budget as guidance for enhancing NDCs in 2020, with UNEP calling this the “last opportunity to close the 2030 emissions gap.”

Noting that the world’s major economies subsidize investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction amounting to US$18-70 billion per year, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) submission outlines the need to curtail fossil fuel supply as an essential part of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, outlining a vision for a managed decline in fossil fuel use. The submission highlights the potential for such a transition to result in social and economic benefits, including through the reinvestment of added tax revenues from fossil fuel production, particularly if these are redirected towards meeting the SDGs. The WRI submission also highlights the need to ensure a vision in which the SDGs and climate action are mutually reinforcing, noting that climate impacts have the potential for detrimental effects on the achievement of the SDGs, whereas well-designed climate policy measures for mitigation and adaptation can advance core development objectives, including health (SDG 3), decent employment (SDG 8), energy access (SDG 7), transport accessibility (SDGs 9, 11), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and landscape protection and biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15).

How do we get there?

Having identified the significant gap between current actions and policies and that which is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the submissions relating to the third question (How do we get there?), identify policies, plans and sectoral actions that need to be put in place to achieve the long-term goals. Underscoring the need to enhance ambition, the submissions also highlight opportunities for broader achievement of social and economic benefits, and interlinkages with the SDGs.

Setting long-term, low-GHG emission development pathways is identified as a key tool in response to the third question. The submission by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) underscores that “developing national and local long-term pathways is critical for the low-carbon transition,” highlighting the importance of creating broad stakeholder ownership of a long-term vision, as well as informing short-term policy decisions in light of deep decarbonization goals.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) submission highlights the economic growth and new employment opportunities that can be created through a transition to a clean energy future, noting that the millions of new jobs that will be created in activities related to deployment and maintenance of renewables and energy efficiency measures would “more than offset” job losses in fossil fuel sectors. Specific policy measures suggested within the submission include: ensuring the quick implementation of renewable energy targets in current NDCs; considering options for strengthening renewable energy targets in NDCs; and broadening the scope of renewable energy components in NDCs.

Many submissions note the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector. Noting that the aviation sector currently accounts for 4.9% of the warming impact on earth, and that international shipping is responsible for 2.6% of global emissions, Climate Action Network (CAN), with the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), and Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), respectively, call for decarbonization pathways for these sectors to be developed, detailing the measures that can be taken to make these achievable, and highlighting the sensitivity of these sectors to climate change impacts. The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) submission, on behalf of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the SLoCaT membership, identifies 20 “quick win actions” for the transport sector as well as a “global macro roadmap” to achieve a net-zero emissions transport sector by 2060-2080.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) submission also recommends action to be urgently enhanced, highlighting the mutually reinforcing nature of well-designed economic and climate policies, which it claims could add 1% to average economic output in G20 countries by 2021, rising to almost 5% by 2050 if the economic benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding or storm damage, are factored in. Specifically, the OECD submission makes several recommendations, for example to integrate climate imperatives into structural reform and broader national development strategies, including sustainable infrastructure, “reflecting the role of the physical environment as a fundamental pillar for strong, sustainable, balanced growth.”

Many submissions also note the importance of non-state actors in advancing climate action, including cities, civil society, and corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, among others.

An overview of inputs to the Talanoa Dialogue by Parties and non-Party stakeholders will be prepared by the COP Presidencies and the UNFCCC Secretariat for the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, with the objective of simplifying the wealth of information received and making participants aware of inputs submitted.

55,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-analyzes-ocean-conference-commitments/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Analyzes Ocean Conference Commitments,"March 2018: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has published a summary and an analysis of the voluntary commitments made in support of the UN Ocean Conference and achievement of SDG 14 on life below water. The commitments covered all SDG 14 targets, with most relating to more than one. The most frequently addressed target was 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). By the text, a majority of the commitments were registered by governments, followed by NGOs and UN entities, with academia, the scientific community and philanthropic organizations registering the fewest commitments.

The high-level event titled, ‘UN Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ (the Ocean Conference), convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from 5-9 June 2017. As part of the outcomes of the Conference, stakeholders registered voluntary commitments for implementation of SDG 14. To date, 1,406 have been logged, and the registration continues. The summary cautions that a number of deliverables pre-date the Ocean Conference, often by many years, indicating ongoing projects.

In analyzing the voluntary commitments geographically, the publication finds that overall, voluntary commitments had good global coverage, spanning most countries and including almost all countries with access to the ocean. They covered all ocean basins, with most commitments relating to the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Regions contributing the largest number of voluntary commitments were Western Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania. The text notes that developed regions with high GDPs made commitments, but many of these focused on activities within their own regions. UN entities provided commitments covering the largest number of countries and global contributions, or contributions not targeting specific countries.

541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion.

The authors mention that using the best, currently available data, a total of 541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with the total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion. In addition, almost all the commitments include in-kind funding as well as staff and technical expertise.

The voluntary commitments will contribute, when achieved, an additional 2.85% to the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs). The increase in protected areas will add to the MPAs present today, covering 6.35% of the ocean. These actions will contribute to the achievement of target 14.5, and, together with the already proposed but unimplemented MPAs (about 1.3% coverage according to the World Database on Protected Areas), will help reach the 10% target, with approximately 10.3% attained by 2020.

The report also offers an analysis of how the voluntary commitments may contribute to the attainment of other SDGs. It shows close linkages between SDG 14 and SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, and SDG 2 on zero hunger. Voluntary commitments on SDG 14 were most often linked (by a count) to SDG 13 on climate action.

The report also reveals a number of gaps. On targets and priority issues within those targets, the publication notes that more attention needs to be paid to both the politically sensitive topic of fisheries subsidies and the issues impacting small scale and artisanal fishers. In addition, answering the many open scientific questions on ocean acidification should also be made an urgent priority. Other issues, such as marine biotechnology and innovative ocean technologies and engineering solutions, such as renewable ocean energy, the text observes, could also benefit from further attention. While there were no glaring geographical gaps, the authors mention that some adjustments might be necessary to ensure that efforts to increase scientific knowledge, capacity building, and technology transfer (target 14.a) focus on those regions and countries that need it most. This is also the case, the text underlines, for capacity building relating to ocean acidification research (target 14.3).

Noting the large number of commitments and the variety of the types of information submitted when registering them, the publication reports that some aspects of successful follow-up should include:

a framework, such a web-based registry, to review commitments and incorporate progress reports to assess individual and collective progress in a public follow-up;

defined methods, data and indicators to support follow-up;

regular reporting by commitment makers in a manner that accounts for diversity between commitments, while including common elements that allow progress to be summarized across targets and SDG 14 as a whole;

and maintaining momentum through face-to-face meetings, possibly at the margins of oceans-related conferences.

As new commitments are continuously registered, the authors mention that this analysis will be periodically updated. They further note that the Ocean Conference voluntary commitments should be analyzed in relationship to other similar commitments, such as those registered during the ‘Our Ocean’ Conferences or those found in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) related to the Paris Agreement as well as National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). They recommend a study that looks in detail into the collective impact of all ocean relevant commitments.

56,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/regional-forum-promotes-3rs-resource-efficiency-to-achieve-multiple-sdgs/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Regional Forum Promotes 3Rs, Resource Efficiency to Achieve Multiple SDGs","16 April 2018: The Eighth Regional 3R Forum in Asia and the Pacific examined how using the 3Rs (reducing, reusing and recycling) can help achieve waste-related targets under SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), as well as other SDGs, including on health, water, land, climate, oceans and sustainable cities. Its outcomes will serve as a contribution to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF).

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum convened from 9-12 April 2018, in Indore, India. Its outcomes include: a dialogue among Asian mayors and city authorities on how the 3Rs and resource efficiency can make their cities sustainable; a declaration by cities; the launch of a report on the state of 3Rs in the region; and awards recognizing Indian recipients for their contributions to the 3Rs in their country.

The Eighth Forum’s theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3R and Resource Efficiency – A 21st Century Vision for Asia – Pacific Communities,’ focused on how the 3Rs, resource efficiency, and promoting the principles of a circular economy can contribute to achieving the targets of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). For example, a plenary session devoted to water noted how street cleaning, improved waste management infrastructure and practices, no open defecation, and basic sanitation services can reduce water pollution and water scarcity, improve the provision of clean drinking water, and reduce vector- and water-borne diseases, as well as improve resilience to natural disasters.

A plenary session on air examined how cleaner streets and the prevention of open trash burning reduces asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Participants also discussed ways to switch from the common practice in Asia of burning agricultural wastes such as rice straw, which reduces air quality, to recycling the wastes to produce bio-ethanol for use as fuel and chemical inputs.

Other plenary sessions addressed: how 3R principles and strategies can contribute to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems from land-based activities, particularly marine litter; how to “green” small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and get them involved in the circular economy; 3Rs technologies appropriate for addressing special waste issues, such as plastics, e-waste and medical wastes; and financing 3R infrastructure and programs. A parallel event examined strategies for addressing marine litter in the South Asia region.

During the Forum, a parallel Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue convened on the theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3Rs and Resource Efficiency,’ co-chaired by the mayor and commissioner of the host city of Indore, respectively, Malini Laxman Singh Gaur and Manish Singh. The Dialogue discussed the contribution of the 3Rs to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Guar and Singh discussed Indore’s efforts to meet the seven targets of SDG 11 before the 2030 deadline, including efforts on housing, transport, participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning, municipal waste management, green and clean public spaces, and disaster and climate resilience. Special sessions of the Mayors’ Policy Dialogue addressed waste challenges specific to Asian cities such as plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical wastes.

The Mayors’ Policy Dialogue concluded with the signing of the ‘Indore 3R Declaration on Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air in Cities’ by mayors and city authorities of 37 Asian cities. The declaration calls for collective efforts on 3R and resource efficiency and the signatory cities pledge to, inter alia:

Accelerate holistic waste management;

Implement local-level actions to make cities clean, safe, smart, resilient, resource efficient, inclusive and sustainable;

Partner with civil society organizations (CSOs), including integration of the informal recycling sector with the formal waste management chain;

Work towards a complete ban on the use of plastics in eco-sensitive or eco-fragile areas, including in tourist areas close to oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;

Work for wastewater treatment and reuse; and

Focus on effective management of special waste streams such as micro-plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical waste.

Two more cities signed the Declaration before the close of the Forum, and it remains open to signature by other Asian cities through 2030.

The Forum also launched a report titled, ‘State of the 3Rs in Asia and the Pacific.’ Mandated by the sixth Forum in 2015, the report is envisioned as a regular assessment of Forum member State progress towards achieving the commitments in the Ha Noi 3R Declaration (2013-2023) adopted at the fourth meeting held in 2013 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The 2018 report makes a series of recommendations, including: highlighting 3Rs as part of the global sustainability agenda, particularly SDG 12; continued prioritization of resource productivity, waste prevention and reduction activities; ensuring comparable and credible data across countries in Asia and the Pacific; and giving greater attention to e-waste, marine litter and coastal plastic waste, micro-plastics, food waste and food loss issues in the region.

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum was organized by the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ), and India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was attended by delegates from 45 countries, including government representatives of 28 Forum participating countries.

Created by the East Asia Environment Ministers Meeting in 2008 based on a proposal by Japan, the Forum is intended as a framework for high-level policy dialogue on the 3Rs among central and local governments, international organizations, aid agencies, research bodies, NGOs and the private sector. As of the Fifth Forum held in Surabaya, Indonesia, the platform was extended to include participation by Pacific nations, particularly the Pacific small island developing States (P-SIDS).

The white paper explores the successful use of blockchain in bringing new levels of efficiency and effectiveness to the fields of development aid, supply chain management, renewable energy and economic growth.

The Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development was established in September 2017 to develop a multi-sectoral framework to support the UN system, along with Member States, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector and civil society in utilizing blockchain-based technologies to develop local, national and global solutions to urgent challenges.

Launched on 2 March 2018, the publication titled, ‘The Future is Decentralised: Block Chains, Distributed Ledgers and the Future of Sustainable Development,’ aims to demystify block chain technology and demonstrate real-world applicability of its potential, using case studies and field work. The paper is designed as the first volume in a series of primers to provide policy makers, regulators, and UN Member States a non-technical introduction to block chain technology.

The paper calls for using the principles of “do no harm” and “design with not for” when using block chain technology.

The text also looks at the risks posed by this nascent technology, providing suggestions on managing them. The publication identifies several factors that may temper block chain adoption, including:

Telecom infrastructure: Every country must have a certain quality level of information and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate the reach of block chain technology;

Legislative barriers: There needs to be consideration of each country’s legislation and how block chain technology intertwines with it;

Data integrity: Data security protocols and procedures must be in place;

Project management: Agile management, randomized control trials to measure progress and impact, and informed iterations of the actual product itself are needed;

Barriers to communication and education: Customers must be educated about what the technology does, what its advantages are and how to use it; and

Inadequate institutional capacity: Relevant institutions require an appropriate operational capacity in terms of staff, finance, procurement, and logistical resources, as well as the requisite technical ability.

The white paper identifies several principles that should be respected when designing and using block chain technology, including “Do no harm” (stressing that ethical concerns surrounding privacy and the rights of the individual ought to be at the forefront of considerations) and “Design ‘with’ not ‘for’” (conveying that the role of the individual should inform the design of any block chain initiative).

Volume 2 in the primer series is expected to address six additional development areas and feature case studies. It will be released in mid-2018.

Titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste: Hotels,’ the findings have been welcomed by industry and sustainability actors for their potential contribution towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3, which seeks to halve food waste by 2030.

The report was co-authored by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and sustainability organization WRAP, with support from Walmart Foundation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands. Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive of Tesco and Chair of Champions 12.3, which commissioned the study, emphasized the need to take action right across the food chain in order to achieve SDG 12.3. It is estimated that one-third of all food produced in the world is never eaten, with food loss and waste accounting for around US$940 billion in economic losses and eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. At the same time, some 800 million people do not have enough food to eat.

Based on a sample of 42 hotel firms in 15 countries, the study found that the majority were able to achieve a 7:1 return on investment from buying less food and thereby reducing purchase costs, increasing revenue from new menu items developed from leftovers or foods previously considered “scraps,” and lower waste management costs. According to the study report, nearly 90 percent of sites were able to keep their total investment below $20,000, which was less than one percent of sales on average, with more than two-thirds recouping their investment costs within one year.

Yolanda Kakabadse, Board Member of the World Wildlife Fund US, stated that reducing food waste within the hospitality sector provides a unique opportunity not only to influence an industry, but to raise awareness with travelers globally. Marcus Gover, Chief Executive of WRAP, called for a “momentum for change in all hotels,” noting the study had clearly demonstrated that with simple measures, hotels can save money, protect the environment and still satisfy the needs of their customers.

The report outlines five actions for hotel owners and managers: measure the amount of food being wasted to know where to prioritize efforts; engage staff; re-think the buffet; reduce overproduction; and re-purpose excess food. It further proposes that by working together, businesses may also be able to share new best practices to make an even greater impact.

The report follows a 2017 study titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste,’ and is the first in a series of papers examining the business case for specific industry sectors. Analyses of the catering and restaurant industries are expected to be released in 2018.

Meanwhile, the Plastic Bank is using blockchain technology to incentivize the collection and recycling of plastic waste.

The Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance represents an agreement among the UK, Ghana, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Vanuatu to jointly tackle marine plastic. The countries have pledged to ban microbeads in personal care products and rinse-off cosmetics and to cut plastic bag use by 2021. The Alliance aims to drive action on SDG 14 (life below water) and to encourage other Commonwealth countries to sign up to and implement international agreements to protect the ocean, including the UN Clean Seas campaign, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative and the London Protocol.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance. This funding includes £25 million to support research on marine plastic from a scientific, economic and social perspective; £25 million to address plastic and other environmental pollution generated by manufacturing in developing countries and prevent this waste from entering the ocean; and £16.4 million to improve waste management at a national and city level, and prevent plastics from entering the water. Participating developing countries are also eligible to bid for support to improve their waste management systems and implement other initiatives to address plastic waste. In addition, the UK Department for International Development will match public donations to the Alliance.

The UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said, through the Alliance, the UK aims “to harness the full power of the Commonwealth in pushing for global change and safeguarding our marine environment for future generations.

The Alliance will work with business and NGOs, including the World Economic Forum, Sky, the Coca-Cola Company, Fauna and Flora International and WWF. Fauna and Flora International CEO Mark Rose said, “urgent and collective action is now needed to reduce the levels of plastic reaching our oceans” and expressed his organization’s commitment to help the Alliance achieve its aims.

Also on plastic pollution, the Plastic Bank aims to incentivize people in Brazil, Haiti and the Philippines to bring plastic waste to recycling collection areas. The Bank rewards plastic collectors with digital tokens that can be accessed by smartphone and exchanged for goods such as food, water or phone minutes. The Plastic Bank works with Cognition Foundry and IBM to implement this exchange using blockchain technology, which helps to ensure a cashless method that can support financial inclusion and minimize individuals’ risk of robbery. According to its co-founder, Shaun Frankson, the Plastic Bank provides an opportunity for “anyone with a smartphone and scale to create their own local recycling business and ecosystem.” The Bank plans to expand into Indonesia, Ethiopia, India and South Africa within the next year.

The agreement was announced at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of the GEF-7 replenishment.

The meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 April 2018. The GEF-7 replenishment will formally conclude during the GEF Assembly, which will convene from 27-28 June 2018, in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

The talks for GEF-7 included a review of the ‘Sixth Overall Performance Study of the GEF’ (OPS6), which notes that the GEF occupies a unique space in the global environmental financing architecture because of its broad focus and role as a financial mechanism for environmental conventions. Participants also considered programming directions during GEF-7 (FY19-FY22), and recommended updates to the STAR allocation methodology, including measures to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable GEF-recipient countries, among others.

The talks for GEF-7 were called for in October 2016, at the 51st meeting of the GEF Council, which requested the Trustee, in cooperation with the Secretariat, to initiate the discussions. Subsequently, meetings took place in Paris, France (28-30 March 2017), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (3-5 October 2017), Brasília, Brazil (23-25 January 2018) and Stockholm, Sweden (25 April 2018). Participants in the negotiations included: existing and potential Contributing Participants; representatives from non-donor recipient countries representing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean; NGO/CSO representatives from a donor country-based NGO/CSO and a recipient country; representatives of the private sector; and representatives of GEF Agencies and the conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism.

The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol. The GEF also funds activities in the areas of sustainable forest management, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.

The SDGs aim to target different stakeholders, including businesses and development cooperation agencies, into “doing more and better with less"". Of the 17 SDGs, one goal that companies are adopting at the workplace is SDG 12, which aims to promote responsible consumption and production, resource and energy efficiency, and development of sustainable infrastructure within the workplace, among others.

For instance, some companies are integrating green practices in day-to-day functions, especially dry waste management and recycling. Eco-actions include promoting the use of ceramic mugs or glass cups for beverages to save on paper products, recycling office supplies such as discarded paper, purchasing recycled paper, and using refillable pens.

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), an advocacy organization, says the private sector is increasingly adopting practices that aim at reducing and recycling waste produced within the office premises. “These are very important strategies to change practices within offices that can then have a cumulative impact at a citywide scale,"" she notes.

E-commerce firm Flipkart, which has just moved into a new office building in Bengaluru this month, has replaced paper cups with ones made of ceramic and glass. Employees have been given stainless-steel water bottles that they can refill. “This one move is helping us save 4,000 litres of potable water every week, and not add 10,000 plastic bottles to landfills every year,"" says Nagaraj Kulkarni, senior director, projects, at Flipkart.

The company has also placed large bins at different points on each work floor to segregate wet and dry waste. To ensure this, and minimize the use of garbage bags, it does not allow dustbins at individual desks. These steps were taken after employee surveys, with ideas being developed over around 18 months.

As a part of its green initiative, online classifieds company OLX India has replaced the plastic tableware in its cafeteria with reusable cutlery. Paper recycle bins have been installed in its Gurugram office to store paper waste. “Every month, the collected paper waste is reused to produce reusable office stationery,"" says Varun Madan, head of human resources, OLX India.

Pune-based technology services company Persistent Systems has stopped the use of disposable plastic paper cups and plates, and is hoping to restrict the use of tissue paper. On an average, it dedicates around 10 days in a year to programmes such as “no plastic day"" or “zero food wastage week"", to reinforce sustainable consumption practices.

“We also run several environment conservation programmes, such as observing ‘no printer days’ to save paper,"" says Kedar Paranjape, chief administrative officer. Most of these initiatives—employee-led, and facilitated by internal teams and the Persistent Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm—are run through the year, adds Paranjape.

Some public sector utilities are also pitching in. Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL), a natural gas distribution company, has adopted initiatives such as the conversion of waste paper into writing pads and envelopes through a waste management enterprise, Sampurna Earth. “The aim is to drive both the individual (employee) and the organization towards eco-friendly practices,"" says Goutam Ghosh, technical director at MGL.

Some companies are taking the help of non-profits and social enterprises which provide services such as waste audits, designing waste management systems, monitoring waste generation, recycling and collection of paper waste, metallic and plastic materials.

“Most of the companies with whom we work are quite eager on sustainability. They use our recycled products that are processed from their waste,"" says Abdul Rahman Janoo, product manager at Waste Ventures India, a Hyderabad-based waste-management enterprise that has worked with around 13 companies, including Google India, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever and Amazon India.

It has also developed a software that allows companies to track waste generation, and design green strategies accordingly. “Through this process, for example, a company realized it was generating a lot of tetra-pack waste. After examining the information, instead of going with 100-200ml juice packs, the firm decided to use 2 litre boxes for its events and meetings. In that way, they reduced tetra pack waste from their premises by 30%,"" says Janoo.

What is helping to drive this change is the fact that firms are beginning to realize they must be seen as a “green company"" to attract the increasingly environmentally conscious consumer.

Roychowdhury notes that both growing consciousness and regulatory demand are influencing corporate policy. “Sustainability is also linked to economics, because at the end of the day you are saving resources. And if you are saving resources, the cost recovery of operations becomes much more efficient.""

If you’re willing to part with a few hundred dollars US, you can get some serious hardware that a decade ago would have been effectively outside the reach of the hobbyist. Right now you can order a four channel oscilloscope for less than what a new Xbox costs; but which one you’ll rack up more hours staring at slack-jawed is up to you.

Of course, these “cheap” pieces of equipment aren’t always perfect. [Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking. Fortunately, the function generator accepts an external clock which can be used to increase its accuracy, so he decided to build one.

[Paul] starts off by going over the different options he considered for this project, essentially boiling down to whether or not he wanted to jump through the extra hoops required for an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). But the decision was effectively made for him when his first attempt at using a more simplistic temperature controlled oscillator failed due to an unfortunate misjudgment in terms of package size.

In the end, he decided to spring for the OCXO, and was able to use the USB port on the front panel of the SDG 1025 to provide the power necessary for the crystal to warm up and remain at operating temperature. After he got the oscillator powered, he just needed to put it in a suitable metal enclosure (to cut down external interference) and calibrate it. [Paul] cleverly used the NIST WWV broadcast and his ears to find when his frequency standard overlapped that of the source, therefore verifying it was at 10 MHz.

Hackers love accuracy, and accordingly, we’ve seen a number of frequency standard builds ranging from extremely cheap to luxuriously overkill.","[Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking.

Where television offers a venue for exploring a subject for years, movies make a definite statement.

The Avengers, which brought the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe project to a close, was a real movie in this Whedonesque sense. With Avengers: Age of Ultron, a creative tug-of-war erupted between Whedon and Marvel Studios (one Whedon later admitted “broke” him) over the studio’s insistence on using the film to set the stage for the next phase, like a TV episode.

The fact is, every MCU movie to date that isn’t an origin story (for a hero or a team) has had a distinct extended second-act feel, like episodes in a series orchestrated by power producer Kevin Feige, the big-screen equivalent of a showrunner.

This includes the more celebrated installments like the Captain America sequels as well as introductory non-origin stories like Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther. Even the origin stories aren’t automatically immune: Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange meet Whedon’s standard, but Ant-Man doesn’t.

Fans might ask whether this is necessarily a bad thing. Who says Whedon’s theory is the only way? There have been big-screen cliffhangers before, from The Empire Strikes Back to Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Anyway, television is better than movies these days; perhaps movies can or ought to adapt?

I don’t think so, no. Not like this, anyway.

Consider Avengers: Infinity War. Indeed, you must consider it, since it isn’t just the latest installment in the MCU, it is the MCU — as much of it as could possibly be compressed into a sprawling 160 minutes.

Picking up where Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther left off, it mashes up the Guardians with Doctor Strange, Spider-Man and the remnants of the shattered Avengers left in the wake of Civil War.

What pulls all these sprawling properties into the same orbit is the MCU’s ultimate big bad: Thanos, a twisted, godlike being who looks not entirely unlike a lavender-dyed Dwayne Johnson, but with a tree stump where his chin should be.

The power broker behind Loki in Avengers and Ronan in Guardians, Thanos is out to collect all six of the MCU’s all-powerful MacGuffins, the Infinity Stones, which together form a weapon of ultimate power capable of reshaping reality.

Unique among comic-book screen villains, Thanos is soft-spoken, with an air of empathy and compassion and none of the grandiosity of Loki or the sneering swagger of Guardians’ Ronan. (He’s sagely underplayed, via performance capture, by Josh Brolin, but for the rest of the cast you’re on your own. If you don’t know the main players by this point, heaven help you.)

Thanos doesn’t want to rule the universe or destroy it. An implacable embodiment of Population Bomb-style Malthusian culture-of-death anxieties, he just wants to wipe out half of all living things for the good of the remaining half.

Infinity War is the grandiose culmination to date, not only of the 10-year history of the MCU, but of the larger comic-book super-culture. Infinity War can be seen as a commentary of the failings of Justice League, which unwisely sought to conflate the arcs of all the Avengers movies to date, including this one, into a single film.

More than that, Infinity War is a rebuke to every would-be Hollywood shared universe seeking to emulate the MCU’s success, every cinematic Big Bang that fizzled out, from Warner Bros’ MonsterVerse and Universal’s failed Dark Universe to the abortive franchise planned around Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur movie.

It’s even an apex of sorts for the whole apocalyptic ultimate-weapon action-blockbuster genre linking movies from Star Wars to Tomorrowland, along with something like half the Marvel movies to date, all of which turn on what I’ve called a Black Box of Badness.

The Tesseract in The Avengers, the Aether in Thor: The Dark World and the Orb in Guardians were all Black Boxes of Badness. They were also Infinity Stones, and, when you combine them with the other three, they become the Ultimate Black Box of Badness. Really! Infinity War is peak Black Box of Badness, for good and for ill.

Infinity War does the thing it does about as well as I can imagine it being done. It’s from the same writer-director teams as Civil War (screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, directors Anthony and Joe Russo), but the cast is almost twice the size and the storylines to be juggled are exponentially more complex.

There are some tonal dissonances between, for instance, grim scenes of death and mayhem and banal Guardians-style buffoonery — for example, an insecure Star-Lord protesting that he’s not affecting a deeper voice to sound more like Thor. Later there’s a far worse moment with Star-Lord that disgraces his character basically beyond redemption (not that he wasn’t already a total jerk in the second Guardians movie).

Yet the screenplay has been much labored over, with clever choices made and threads carefully aligned; for the most part it barrels along like the world’s biggest, flashiest monster truck. Six years ago I described The Avengers as “awesomeness squared”; Infinity War strives with all its might for awesomeness cubed and even tesseracted. It wants to leave you texting your friends “MIND. BLOWN.” It might succeed — but there’s a catch.

Infinity War works by going bigger than every Marvel middle movie to date, not only in all they do, but in all they leave undone. These movies all write checks to be paid off by future movies, which means that a final verdict on any film is always hostage to the next film, and the one after that.

Infinity War settles existing debts in uneven ways. The heroics at the end of Thor: Ragnarok felt hollow to me at the time, but they feel a lot hollower now. Wakanda becomes the site of a fiercely fought last stand, which will gratify Black Panther fans while at the same time burying Wakanda’s political evolution and aspirations in nihilistic destruction.

What will it feel like to go back and watch these films, knowing what follows? There’s no way to know, because Infinity War achieves the biggest of effects by writing the biggest of checks — to be paid off, as always, in the future.

Looking back, I find myself focusing on vanishingly brief moments of humanity, notably a pair of potentially important conversations between a man and a woman about their relationship: Tony and Pepper in New York; Vision and Wanda/Scarlet Witch in Scotland.

Both conversations are rudely and quickly interrupted by extremely dangerous events, because this is a movie about a potential apocalypse and not about ordinary human life. But there it is: We need some sense of ordinary human life if the apocalypse is supposed to matter.

The scene with Wanda and Vision, in particular, is perhaps the most ordinary human moment in the film (prescinding from Vision being an artificial being). If there’s a moment in the film that says “Life is good,” it’s this moment — and, in a movie with a villain eloquently articulating a compassionate case for wiping out half of all life in the universe, the counterproposal that life is good shouldn’t be taken for granted.

No relationship in the MCU is as vital and interesting as Tony and Pepper’s in the first Iron Man. (T’Challa and his sister Shuri in Black Panther come closest.) That so vibrant a “civilian” as Pepper has been for years reduced to cameos (or, worse, temporarily infused with superpowers) is emblematic of why the small-screen approach doesn’t scale well to the big screen.

On a weekly series, Pepper would be a regular character and her relationship with Tony would occasionally be at least the B-plot of an entire episode. A weekly series can vary between quieter, less eventful episodes and more high-impact episodes, each informing the other.

A tentpole movie, no matter how many Marvel cranks out or how long past two hours they run, has no time for that. Each installment is an Event, with big beats and (hypothetically) big stakes. (Spider-Man: Homecoming somewhat subverted the formula with a pleasingly smaller-scale story. Infinity War is the polar opposite, working the formula as it’s never been worked before.)

Infinity War not only doesn’t make a definite statement; it hardly poses a question. Thanos has an idea, an ideology, but it’s barely challenged or cross-examined.

Perhaps the most important exchange occurs between Thanos and Gamora, whom he raised as his daughter after massacring her people. (By the end of the film it’s clear that Thanos is the de facto protagonist and his relationship with Gamora the defining relationship. There’s a flashback to Gamora’s childhood that probably should have opened the film.)

Thanos argues that he saved Gamora since her people lived in desperate poverty — but Gamora insists that they were happy. To Thanos’ contention that universal overpopulation will lead to misery, Gamora says only, “You don’t know that.” There’s nothing here like the elderly German defying Loki’s command to kneel in The Avengers or Cap rebuffing Loki’s worldview by alluding to his “disagreement” with Hitler.

While the filmmakers work hard to balance the cast, some players are more crucial than others. In chess terms, Vision is the king and the Scarlet Witch perhaps the queen. After that, Thor and especially Doctor Strange stand out.

On its own terms, Infinity War must be judged a success. That’s because the overriding creative priority is just like most Marvel movies: to make you want to see the next one. Mission accomplished — though I say it with a certain resentful irony.

Yes, I want to see the next Marvel movie. But I long for popcorn movies like the last couple of Mission: Impossible installments, in which, after two-plus hours of ridiculously entertaining action, the mission actually is accomplished.

Caveat Spectator: Much intense fantasy action violence, fantasy torture and a high mortality rate; some profanity, cursing and crude language.

67,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-ready-player-one,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Ready Player One’,"The sell for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is a little like the sell for Jurassic Park, except instead of dinosaur shock and awe, it’s pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe.

So the T-rex from Jurassic Park is actually in there, along with King Kong, the Iron Giant, Lara Croft, Marty McFly’s time-traveling DeLorean and Adam West’s Batmobile, a notable weapon from the Alien franchise, an iconic setting from a celebrated horror movie, an ’80s-centric score that includes Van Halen, Tears for Fears and Joan Jett, and far, far too many video game and cinematic homages and Easter eggs to document, even if I saw the movie a dozen times, which would definitely be at least 10 times too many.

Worlds collide in Ready Player One in a digital mashup multiverse called the OASIS, a sci-fi virtual vale akin in its own way to J.M. Barrie’s Neverland or C.S. Lewis’ Narnia, a patchwork of disparate mythologies all hugger-mugger. (Barrie juxtaposes pirates, mermaids, fairies, American Indians and flying children; Lewis draws on Greco-Roman and Norse mythology, Hans Christian Andersen, Beatrix Potter and Kenneth Grahame, Arthurian legend, Father Time and even Father Christmas, and, of course, the Bible.)

J.R.R. Tolkien detested such pastiches, but the sort of person who loves Tolkien for the encyclopedic depth of Middle-earth will often love the very different encyclopedic quality of Narnia — or the OASIS.

Ready Player One is a curator’s garden of delights, and if you love the sort of things that go into it and you don’t mind your carrots and peas touching (the way Tolkien did), this movie might be your candy store.

You know there’s a “but” coming, right?

The world of the OASIS exists in 2045 alongside an oppressive dystopian future from which the virtual reality of the OASIS is the only escape for most people.

Take our hero, a young orphan named Wade Watts (The Tree of Life’s Tye Sheridan), who lives in the high-rise trailer-park slums of what used to be Columbus, Ohio, with his aunt and her abusive boyfriend (Susan Lynch and Ralph Ineson).

Wade’s life is lived as Parzival, a digital character with a shock of fair hair like The Legend of Zelda’s Link (circa Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, twin hanks flowing like curtains framing his forehead) and a sword emblem on the back of his jacket in token of his Arthurian nom de jeu.

And here’s the thing: Ready Player One, adapted from Ernest Cline’s novel by Zac Penn and Cline himself, wants to go all in on pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe in virtual-reality fantasy — but it also wants to leave us with the salutary notion that reality is, like, important, too (so kids, remember to unplug, go outside and interact with people in real life).

After all, reality is “the only place you can get a decent meal,” according to tech wizard James Halliday (Mark Rylance), co-creator of the OASIS. Well, actually, Halliday is dead, so it’s a digital version of him in the OASIS who says the thing about decent meals.

But Ready Player One isn’t interested in decent meals, and we never see anyone preparing or enjoying one. Anyway, Halliday is referencing Groucho Marx, so the movie’s best line about “reality” is just one more blasted Easter egg.

Reality is also purportedly the only place where a boy and a girl can really get to know one another, fall in love and certainly kiss. Anyway, Wade is perhaps meant to look foolish for thinking he’s in love with a legendary gamer he knows only by her digital alter ego, Art3mis, a punk-rock action heroine with spiky pink hair and anime-ish oversized eyes.

Certainly Art3mis thinks Wade a fool, and pointedly tells him that he knows nothing about her; certainly she doesn’t actually look like her avatar. And Wade definitely makes a serious mistake by giving Art3mis his real name inside the OASIS. (Always remember, kids, how very foolish it is to give strangers personal information online.)

But eventually Wade meets the face behind Art3mis, which belongs to Samantha Cook (Ouija’s Olivia Cooke), and his digital crush merges pretty seamlessly into the real world. Fortunately for Wade, Samantha is a) actually female, b) actually attractive, and c) neither too old nor too young for him. This does not go without saying (in the OASIS nobody knows you’re a dog).

Samantha isn’t even a different skin tone from Wade, which might not have mattered, except insofar as not mattering would have mattered. She does have a feature she is embarrassed about, which Wade pointedly dismisses as unimportant to him. That Wade himself lacks Parzival’s sculpted cheeks and flippy white locks does not come up.

Eventually there is a real-world kiss, but the individuals in question have spent very little real-world time together. The bottom line is that Ready Player One wants to tell us that reality matters, but the movie really has no interest in its posited “reality” — which is, of course, just a grimmer and less stimulating fantasy.

The plot pits Wade, Samantha and a trio of allies — Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zhao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) — collectively known as the “High Five” against the ruthless CEO of Innovative Online Industries, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn).

At stake: total control of the OASIS. The arena: a series of competitive challenges embedded in the OASIS by Halliday before his death. Yes, rebel gamers must play video games to save the internet from a corporate villain. Remember, this is the movie’s “real world.”

Resolving the challenges involves getting inside Halliday’s head and understanding his defining regrets in life: love lost through fear; friendship lost through resentment. (Don’t be afraid to take the risk, to kiss the girl, to face your pain.)

These are potentially potent themes, but, despite another soulful performance by Rylance, Halliday never emerges as a vital character whose regrets in life amount to much more than scavenger-hunt clues, Maguffins, Rosebuds. The man is (let’s remember) dead, and, while his OASIS alter ego, Anorak, lives on, it’s not him.

It’s not impossible that the figure of Halliday could have had some real poignance. Not only is he played by Rylance, on some level he parallels Spielberg, who did as much as anyone to create the world of 1980s pop-culture nostalgia celebrated here. (Ready Player One doesn’t explicitly celebrate the Spielberg legacy as much as it might have — for one thing, Spielberg didn’t want to make it all about him, and in some cases the rights to certain properties weren’t available anyway — but in any case it’s impossible to imagine the Iron Giant without E.T. or Lara Croft without Raiders of the Lost Ark.)

Perhaps flashbacks of the real Halliday, scattered throughout the film, would have made the theme of middle-aged regret more vital. Perhaps if the drama ultimately turned on vital real-world relationships, the theme of embracing reality wouldn’t feel like a tacked-on public-service announcement.

Perhaps if saving the world involved more than battling a corporate suit for control of the OASIS — perhaps if it involved people’s real-world needs and the lousy state of the world — it might even be moving.

Hey! Did I mention Art3mis drives Kaneda’s bike from Akira and a knife-wielding Chucky shows up to wreak mayhem? Would you believe there are nods to Speed Racer and ThunderCats? How about Battletoads and Halo? I’m just scratching the surface.

The UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed made this known in Bali, Indonesia at the opening plenary of the 2nd International Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) Summit on Monday.

The Summit with the theme; ‘Shifting Norms, Changing Behaviour, Amplifying Voice, What works,’ also featured Entertainment Education as one of the tools for behaviour change communication and holds from April 15-20, 2018.

Mohammed who addressed the ongoing gathering of more than 1,200 researchers, academics and policymakers in a televised message said SBCC is playing important role in engaging young people, empowering victims and shifting attitudes.

“Social behaviour change is critical to addressing gender inequality. The media, entertainment, education and technology sector play important role in helping us mobilize in these constituencies, engage young people, empower victims and shift attitudes.

“The social behaviour change community is well placed to contribute and add meaning. You have the proven ability to harness the power of communication. You are a vibrant community shown by the presence of over 1200 practitioners, researchers, academics and policymakers.

“The United Nations looks forward to working with you and other stakeholders to fully integrate social behaviour communication strategy into development agenda and practice. Together, we can transform societies and our future and uphold our promise to leave no one behind,” Mohammed said.

Earlier in her welcome remarks, the Executive Director, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Program (CCP) Susan Krenn said the presence of so many professionals at the conference will deliver insights that would serve the community of communicators for many years to come.

Among this community of communicators at the summit, are Nigerian organisations including Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI), Save The Children, Centre for Communication and Social Impact (CCSI), UNICEF Nigeria, USAID Nigeria, African Radio Drama Association (ARDA) and Breakthrough Action, among others.

The Minister of Health, Republic of Indonesia, Dr Nila Moeloek who delivered a keynote address said SBCC has the power to change norms and attitudes adding that SBCC is important because it has the power to change people’s lives.

“I am fully aware of the importance of SBCC in improving people’s lives. Indonesia has put this to use in reducing open-air defecation and the use of Sulphur in washing hands. SBCC was key in the fight against Ebola outbreak in Africa and when we had the bird flu (H5N1) strain, communication strategies helped us to overcome this and we were able to change the attitude of both buyers and sellers,” she noted.

The Minister who was represented by the Health Economics Advisor, Dr Mohammad Subur also noted that the social media will be a critical tool in SBCC communication.

The conference has participants from at least 93 countries, 222 sessions, 58 exhibition booths, 1,150 attendees, 20 sponsors, with 1,300 abstracts submitted and 429 organisations represented.","The UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed made this known in Bali, Indonesia at the opening plenary of the 2nd International Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) Summit on Monday.

69,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-a-quiet-place,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘A Quiet Place’,"Real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and director John Krasinski star in a smart monster movie centered on a winning premise — and an even more winning family.

Early in A Quiet Place, the four unnamed members of an unnamed family clasp hands around the supper table and close their eyes for a silent family grace before meals. Such an unremarkable daily gesture of domestic togetherness and piety might be likelier to crop up, ironically, in a post-apocalyptic horror movie than in any other Hollywood genre.

There is something about living from hour to hour for weeks and years in constant peril of vicious predatory monsters roaming the earth that makes one alive to the gift of a meal with loved ones. There is something, too, about the humdrum ritual of giving thanks for daily bread that weaves together yesterday, today and tomorrow with threads of hope and trust, keeping alive the ordinary and at least momentarily banishing the monsters.

It’s not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad — per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs — have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young’s Harvest Moon — sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly — is the most tender screen dance in ages.

Evelyn and Lee are archetypal parents, nurturing and self-sacrificing. Evelyn, carrying their fourth child for much of the movie, home schools Marcus (Noah Jupe, about 12) in math and English, along with doing the cooking and cleaning, though she can handle the family’s lone shotgun as well as Lee.

Bearded Lee tinkers with the elaborate surveillance system with which he has tricked out their remote farmhouse compound and takes Marcus on father-son hunting-gathering expeditions, training him to assume, if necessary, Lee’s role as chief provider and protector.

There isn’t much concern about traditional gender roles in their relationship, and the considerable masculinity on display is anything but toxic. A couple of years ago, in a pair of essays on problems around the negativity of religious representation in Hollywood movies, I noted that positive depictions of Catholic faith and identity in major Hollywood films in recent years tend to be almost exclusively in a particular sort of horror film. Perhaps a good husband and father, like a good priest, is nowhere likelier than in a horror movie of another sort.

On the other hand, their eldest, Regan (Millicent Simmonds, about 14), resents that Marcus is always the one to accompany Lee on his trips — and Marcus would be happy to let his older sister go in his place. But Lee wants Regan to stay home and help Evelyn in his absence.

This is perhaps only partly because Marcus is the oldest boy. It may also be because Regan is hard of hearing, and Lee’s attempts to jerry-rig a cochlear implant that will help her have not yet been successful. Regan fears, too, that there is another reason: She worries that her father blames her, as she blames herself, for a tragedy that is like a wound that won’t heal.

Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness — the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival. For one thing, the family members were already fluent in American Sign Language when the monsters arrived. (Simmonds, excellent in Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck last year, is really deaf, and she coached her fellow cast members in ASL.)

Silence is an effective device in a filmmaker’s arsenal, but few films rely on it quite so extensively — or on the shattering power of even a quiet noise at the wrong moment. A Quiet Place contains almost no spoken dialogue, though characters occasionally permit themselves bare whispers and, on the rarest of occasions, even shouts.

An especially sharp touch in the film’s sound design is the pitching of key moments to Regan’s auditory point of view, depriving the viewer of the sonic cues she doesn’t have. Almost as unsettling are moments in which we hear what the sharp-eared monsters hear.

The Abbotts are survivors, even by necessity survivalists, and they have built a life for themselves that excludes all but the quietest sounds. (The family go barefoot as much as possible, and the creak-free floorboards have been painted so that even Regan can navigate soundlessly. In one scene, Regan and Marcus play Monopoly, rolling the dice onto cloth and using soft objects as makeshift pieces.)

Still, accidents happen, and the movie builds up the defenses around the Abbotts in the first half so we can watch them crack and crumble in the second half. Sooner or later, of course, there will be a childbirth scene, and babies cry. (Notably, there is no ambivalence about Evelyn’s pregnancy; even in this post-apocalyptic landscape, life is an absolute good.)

Perhaps the film’s most dreadfully effective moment involves an utterly mundane household danger — one that would make viewers squirm and wince in any movie but is especially terrible in a movie in which the one thing one must never do is scream.

Monsters and even fear can potentially be kept at bay. More insidious are grief and guilt.

Regan isn’t the only one who blames herself for the family’s great sorrow, and both Evelyn and Lee live with the parental imperative to protect their children at all costs, which, of course, isn’t entirely possible. “Who are we if we can’t protect them?” an anguished Evelyn asks in what should be a moment of joy.

One of the film’s key assets is its minimalism. The story begins on Day 89, with no invasion sequence and little back story. In the time-honored tradition of Jaws and Aliens, the monsters are kept offscreen for as long as possible.

The filmmakers occasionally succumb to the temptation to do more, to the film’s detriment. Marco Beltrami’s creepy score is at its best when it goes subtle and unnerving; too often it seems like a score for a louder horror movie.

Some of the information conveyed via news clippings and Lee’s whiteboard is overkill; the movie tries to make a mystery of something that should have been obvious. (I had barely described the film’s premise to my 11-year-old when he proposed what is meant to come as a third-act revelation.)

What finally sells the film are the performances — all of them.

Blunt, so steely in another smartly made high-concept alien-invasion movie, Edge of Tomorrow, makes Evelyn’s maternal devotion no less formidable than her earlier character’s military edge. Krasinski, best known from The Office, wears the survivalist family-man role so naturally I can scarcely imagine another current actor improving on the performance. (A friend recently commented that it is hard to imagine many young male actors today persuasively playing competent fathers; Krasinski is clearly one who can.)

Both children are excellent, but it’s Simmonds, in perhaps the pivotal role, who especially shines in a performance evoking all the overwhelming emotional complexity of adolescence, whether or not there are predatory monsters about. Even though A Quiet Place is a terrific film just the way it is, I can’t help wishing there were more families like this in other kinds of movies.

70,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-devil-and-father-amorth,"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Devil and Father Amorth’,"The director of The Exorcist makes a documentary about the most famous exorcist of modern times. The result is not greatly to either of their credit.

“He who sups with the devil,” a wise medieval proverb has it, “needs a long spoon.”

William Friedkin, forever known as the director of The Exorcist, may or may not appreciate that proverb, but in The Devil and Father Amorth, a 69-minute documentary featuring Father Gabriele Amorth — perhaps the world’s best-known exorcist until his death in 2016 — Friedkin does interview two people who clearly do.

One is Jeffrey Burton Russell, a historian noted for a five-volume history of demonology who talks about how depressing it was to “work with evil all the time.” His advice: “Don’t concentrate on the devil all the time. … Concentrate on the good, concentrate on God, concentrate on the positive, and don’t think that much about the evil side.”

The other is Bishop Robert Barron, the winsome and media-savvy auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles and founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries. To Friedkin’s astonishment, Bishop Barron adamantly pronounces himself unworthy of “getting in close quarters” with the devil. “People like Father Amorth may be able to do it,” he says cautiously. “I would never dare to do it.”

Clearly, Father Amorth dares. Over a 30-year career, from 1986 to 2016, he performed what he claimed were hundreds of thousands of exorcisms (160,000 as of 2013), averaging up to nine exorcisms per day for years at a time — a furious rate that has elicited astonished criticism from sober Catholic commentators like canonist Edward Peters and apologist Jimmy Akin. (Full disclosure: I know both Ed and Jimmy, especially Jimmy, who is an old and close friend.)

Often wrongly billed as “the chief exorcist of the Vatican” or “the pope’s exorcist,” Father Amorth was never attached to the Holy See, but to the Diocese of Rome, where he was authorized to act as an exorcist but had no special title.

Still, as a co-founder of the International Association of Exorcists, the author of a number of books about demons and exorcism, and a frequent public commenter in the media, he was the de facto public face of the exorcist community. In this capacity, he was known for sensational, extravagant claims, most famously condemning the Harry Potter books as satanic in origin and pronouncing not only Hitler and Stalin, but all rank-and-file Nazis, to be demon-possessed.

None of this comes up in The Devil and Father Amorth. In fact, other than the 20 minutes or so of handheld video footage of the exorcism of an Italian woman — her ninth exorcism, administered on Father Amorth’s 91st birthday, less than five months before his death — we see very little of the celebrity priest himself.

Instead, after an extended introduction filmed at various locations connected with Friedkin’s more famous movie, including Georgetown’s iconic Exorcist steps, the balance of the film is largely made up of interview footage.

Interview subjects include a brother and sister who credit Father Amorth with successfully exorcising the sister, a second woman who is the subject of the present exorcism, and a number of talking heads. Among these are Friedkin’s Exorcist collaborator, the late William Peter Blatty, who adapted his own novel for the screen, and a number of eminent medical and psychological authorities who speak cautiously about the limits of their fields and diagnoses like dissociative trance disorder.

Friedkin makes much of the novelty of his filming of an exorcism, asserting that the Vatican has never before given permission for an exorcism to be filmed. Actually, the Vatican does not directly oversee all exorcisms worldwide, and exorcisms have been filmed before.

For instance, in 1991, ABC’s 20/20 filmed and broadcast the exorcism of a woman who was said to have been inhabited by as many as 10 demons, most memorably one who self-identified as “Minga.”

That 1991 broadcast included moments more striking than anything in Friedkin’s footage of Cristina, administered at the Society of St. Paul congregational residence in Rome where Father Amorth lived and worked.

Although Father Amorth tells us that the devil speaks and acts through Cristina, it seems the devil has little on his mind beyond angry recalcitrance.

The ritual begins with the priest, his long purple stole draped over Cristina’s shoulders, along with a large rosary around Cristina’s neck, thumbing his nose at the devil as he leads Cristina and about a dozen of her family members in the Lord’s Prayer.

Among others, Father Amorth invokes Padre Pio and his own mentor, Father Candido Amantini, who also performed exorcisms for some 30 years. On the wall over Cristina’s head is a photograph of Pope Francis, who has talked more about Satan than the last two popes combined.

Presently, Cristina becomes agitated and begins rocking and writhing in her chair, obliging others to restrain her. Her outbursts — generally inarticulate snarls and cries like “No!” and “Stop!” — are uttered in a voice that sounds unmistakably like an audio editing chorus effect. I am only a permanent deacon and a film critic, not a priest and certainly not an exorcist, but if Cristina’s voice hasn’t been digitally tweaked, for my money the devil needs a new sound design team.

Friedkin’s audio chicanery detracts from what seems to be the sincerity of the woman’s distress, whatever its origin or nature. The very humdrum nature of her outbursts supports their authenticity; a calculated or scripted performance would presumably be more dramatic.

“Send the priest away! I can’t stand it!” she cries. “She belongs to me!” She refuses to answer the priest’s questions about when the possessions began and identifies herself as “Satan” and “legion” or “armies.” At one point, Father Amorth sternly tells the evil spirit it is damned forever and gets the reply, “It’s you who are damned!”

One of the more intriguing exchanges is left untranslated. When Father Amorth asks her how many devils are with her, she says something that sounds like “80 million,” but on cross-examination clarifies as “80 chiefs” (Italian capi).

Sometime after the ordeal is over comes a bizarre coda in which Cristina and her boyfriend allegedly arranged to meet Friedkin in the town of Alatri’s Cathedral Basilica of St. Paul (“considered to be a sacred place,” Friedkin hilariously clarifies, in case this is unclear).

Friedkin offers a complicated account for why this encounter, which winds up taking place in another church, wasn’t filmed, but the bottom line is that we have only his lurid account, scored with screeching strings and dramatized with impressionistic images and sounds, blending the earlier exorcism with glimpses of the church’s interior. Make of it what you will.

Toward the end of The Devil and Father Amorth comes an anecdote that made me cringe. Father Amorth couldn’t wait to reach heaven, an acquaintance says with a chuckle — so that he could beat the devil with a cane. I hope the one-liner does the man a disservice.

If Cristina and Father Amorth seem sincere, the same cannot be said of the filmmaker. Beyond the audio effects and the suspicious unfilmed incident, Friedkin seems more interested in spinning his interview subjects’ answers than in hearing out their perspectives.

For Blatty — a practicing Catholic who researched the real story behind The Exorcist for a nonfiction account, and fictionalized it only when he couldn’t get the family’s permission to write the real story — the hunt for the devil was genuinely part of a larger quest for God.

Friedkin gestures toward this pious move in the closing seconds of the film, but there’s no hint of such a sentiment in the preceding 60-odd minutes.

Whatever Bishop Barron or others may have said about God or Jesus, virtually nothing of this sort made it to the screen. Nor is there any perspective on behaviors that might open the door to demonic influence: involvement in occult activity, magic or divination, for instance.

In a secular age, the mystery of evil can serve for some as a useful signpost to the greater power of good. Sometimes, though, people don’t see past the sign itself, and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in 1975, rightly warned against “obsessional preoccupation with Satan and the demons.”

There is little, if any, genuinely religious dimension to The Devil and Father Amorth. It’s basically a “boo” movie in documentary form — that, and an exercise in brand reinforcement and exploitation.

In an era of found-footage horror movies, genre fans may get a kick from the suggestion that there could be something to this “woo-woo” after all.

Pious viewers may be gratified by the film’s validation of their worldview and the reverential treatment of a conservative fire-and-brimstone clergyman. Skeptics will find confirmation of their disbelief in the film’s evident jiggery-pokery. Few, perhaps, will find much to challenge the preconceptions they sat down with.

Deacon Steven D. Greydanus is the Register’s film critic and creator of Decent Films.

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

The report, published by Global Water Intelligence (GWI), and sent via e-mail to businessam comes at a time when the funding model for water infrastructure is evolving to incorporate more private and commercial finance sources, in the face of ageing infrastructure, population growth and climate change.

Entitled Financing Water to 2030, the report argues that in order to achieve these targets whilst reducing utility dependence on grant finance, tariffs around the world will need to increase substantially, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9 percent and taking the global average combined tariff from $2.08 /m^3 to $4.38 /m^3 in 2030.

In Southern Asia, where average combined water and wastewater tariffs are just $0.14/m^3 compared to a global average of $2.08 /m^3, this means that tariffs would need to rise by 15.2 percent annually in order to meet the investment required by 2030 for SDG6.

Christopher Gasson, publisher at GWI and co-author of the report commented, “we are at an inflection point in the way water is financed. For the past two decades, there hasn’t been much change in the way utility assets are paid for. Going forward, there will be. We will see the utility sector steadily building its financial independence and the corollary of

all this is that tariffs will have to rise.”

The report states that meeting SDG 6, utilities will need to mitigate the effects of ageing infrastructure, industrial pollution, growing urban populations, and the more extreme flooding and droughts brought by climate change, and will need to access more finance sources to meet these challenges.

GWI forecasts that the amount of global private finance used to fund water infrastructure will increase from $3 billion during 2013 / 2017 to $35 billion a year in the next 12 years, providing 7.7 percent of global infrastructure investment needs by 2030.

Within the same time frame, funding for water infrastructure by central government grants and international transfers is expected to fall from 31 percent to 18 percent of annual investment needs, according to the report.

GWI notes that the key driver of this trend is governments moving away from financing water projects on their own balance sheets and through grants to utilities, and towards providing more loans and encouraging public-private partnerships.

In the USA for instance, the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment plan brings with it only $200 million of federal finance. Financing Water to 2030 explains that the rest is expected to come from the private sector.

In Saudi Arabia meanwhile, the government is contemplating the largest water privatisation programme since the UK government sold off its water assets in 1989. The report detailing how the governments of countries such as Japan, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, and Vietnam have recently announced major plans and new legislation for bringing private finance into their water infrastructure, examines how the trend towards mobilising more private finance for water infrastructure is also being driven by development, finance institutions (DFIs), pointing to the “blended finance” strategies at major DFIs like the World Bank.

This increasingly involves developing structured financial products designed to attract commercial finance for more credit-worthy clients, while directing more concessionary resources to places and projects for which they are critical.

Though blended finance has been growing as a concept for several years, the US government’s denial of a capital increase for the World Bank has given the strategy added impetus and visibility.

GWI also found that utility consolidation and government reforms aimed at improving the bankability of projects will be crucial in order to attract the infrastructure finance that utilities need to achieve the SDG on water and sanitation. The report examines several political developments as part of this trend.

In Japan, recent legal reforms to support and incentivise the consolidation of its 2,800 small-scale water and wastewater utilities have been introduced. The USA has also seen growing discussions on utility consolidation with many of the country’s small utilities struggling to maintain their infrastructure. The report explains that the elimination of $509 million in grants for small rural utilities by the federal government will likely make the discussion even more relevant.

GWI will next host The Global Water Summit 2018 in Paris on 15-16th April 2018. The summit’s 2018 agenda will feature a pre-conference workshop on the privatisation of Saudi Arabia’s water sector, along with expert-led sessions and roundtables on PPP opportunities in emerging markets and utility bankability, and sessions on blended finance run in partnership with the World Bank.","Water tariffs globally will need to increase 5.9 percent each year in order to generate the $449 billion of annual investment required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on water and sanitation between 2018 and 2030 and maintain existing infrastructures, a new market report has found.

The two-day expert group meeting, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), featured in-depth discussions on climate action, ocean action, plastic pollution in the ocean, food loss and waste, and sustainable transport as they relate to SCP.

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is one of the six Goals for which governments will conduct an in-depth review at the HLPF’s 2018 session. During the expert group meeting, participants recalled that SDG 12 is the “least well resourced” SDG, according to a report of the UN Secretary-General.

On SDG 12 stocktaking and HLPF preparations, Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA, said the market is “not getting it right” on the true costs of consumption and production. He highlighted the extensively interlinked nature of the SDGs and targets, and called for using empirical information to decide which interlinkages to prioritize for action, but said these choices must be context-specific.

Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of Secretariat of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (10YFP) at the UN Environment Programme, reported on the formation of the ‘One Planet Network,’ a multi-stakeholder network that will serve as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12. Cecilia Lopez Y Royo Di Taurisano, 10YFP Secretariat, said most activity has taken place in the area of SCP readiness, with less activity in SCP implementation. She reported a notable increase in the number of SCP policies and instruments, but said approximately half of these are voluntary, and only 11% are financial instruments.

Participants discussed the need to make an economic case for SCP at the global level, and considered whether the private sector will respond to potential efficiency gains as an incentive to improve SCP, or only regulation. One suggested the need for better branding of SCP. On SCP’s interlinkages with other issues, a government representative highlighted her country’s toolbox to allow national focal points to bring SCP to the table of negotiations in other areas.

The idea that SCP is highly interlinked with other Goals continued to emerge in the session on climate action. Annika Lindblom, Finland’s Ministry of the Environment and Secretary General of the National Commission on Sustainable Development, said SCP “directs attention to the interface of climate and poverty.” She said Finland has combined the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change in order to address material usage and energy usage together. The framework is called ‘Carbon Neutral and Resource-wise Finland,’ and includes a medium-term climate policy plan to 2030 and action plans on procurement, product innovation and support for investments.

Hannah Janetshek, German Development Institute, said that while SDG 12 can have “strong co-benefits across the entire agenda,” it could also increase competition for resources, especially as policies seek to expand access to services in order to leave no one behind.

Mathilde Bouyé, World Resource Institute (WRI), said targets from SDGs 11 and 12 are poorly reflected in the NDCs, specifically 11.6, 11.c, 12.3 and 12.c. Jocelyn Blériot, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, added that so far, the focus of a low-carbon economy has been on energy, with less emphasis on raw material extraction and production. He called for an approach beyond ‘Recycling 2.0.’ With three billion new consumers coming soon, he said we must think differently, such as shifting from selling goods to selling services.

Suggesting that “most people don’t care about the impact of what they buy,” moderator David O’Connor, WRI, suggested that businesses should force people to opt out of positive behaviors rather than require them to opt in. Blériot suggested that regulations are needed in addition to business-led action, and said a number of governments are creating circular economy road maps, including Finland and France, in which businesses must consider what will happen to a product at the end of its first useful life.

In the course of the meeting, participants identified tradeoffs between SDG-related issues that have implications for SCP. These include:

Energy efficiency can be improved by certain thermostats, but recycling could be a challenge given the rare pollutants they contain. Similar challenges were noted with disposal of solar panels.

Lego plans to begin producing blocks out of sugarcane instead of plastic, but harvesting the needed sugarcane could increase land competition.

Plastics are part of the packaging innovations that have reduced food waste.

The interests of marginalized groups could come into conflict with the creation of marine protected areas.

Given these and other trade-offs, Gerald Singh, University of British Colombia, called for choosing priorities to prepare for “sub-aspirational” SDG scenarios. Bouyé said some countries are creating incentives and compensations for vulnerable populations who may be affected by SCP implementation. For example, El Salvador and France are among those including a climate solidarity package in their NDCs.

Wilberforce Kisamba-Mugerwa, Chair of Uganda’s National Planning Authority, reported that the HLPF is not sufficient for creating awareness of SCP, and urged involving sub-national leaders.

Edda Fernández Luiselli, Mexico’s Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources, said that in the Latin American and Caribbean region, sustainability must be promoted as a tool for competitiveness, not an environmental issue. She said that in LAC, the SDG implementors must be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which represent 80% of GDP.

Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, reported on efforts to link the existing ‘OneNYC’ plan with the SDGs, noting that after Hurricane Sandy, the City realized that prevention and protection must be equitable. She gave examples of New York’s waste management policies, such as ‘zero waste by 2030’, which includes bringing recycling to public housing and making public schools zero waste. She announced that New York City will present the first-ever ‘Voluntary Local Review’ at the 2018 session of the HLPF, and said it will map city-level efforts against the SDGs to enable discussions and exchanges with other cities and countries about best practices and filling gaps.

During the sessions on SCP and ocean action and plastic pollution in the ocean, Arthur Andambi, Permanent Mission of Kenya, said Kenya banned plastic bags in 2017. He announced that Kenya will host a blue economy conference from 26-28 November 2018, and noted that Kenya has proposed to host, along with Portugal, a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020.

Sian Sutherland, Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet, said the use of plastic for food and drink packaging represents a momentary use with consequences that last forever, and recommended that governments take action on this. Another participant noted that plastics play a key role in packaging innovations that reduce food waste.

Participants developed ideas for bringing together communities of practice around targets that are closely linked. Arden-Clarke suggested creating a working group on value chains, which could cover both food and plastics. He noted that the upcoming session of the Trade for Sustainable Development Forum will meet on the theme of sustainable value chains for SDG 12, and suggested that a working group on value chains could take advantage both of this event and the subsequent blue economy conference in Kenya.

Several presentations informed participants of the current status of plastic pollution in the ocean and efforts to address it. Speakers noted that plastic production is expected to double or triple within ten years, while the volume of additives in plastic and products’ complexity make recycling a limited solution. Participants observed that many consumers know about the problem, with one suggesting addressing the dynamic between consumer and retailer in order to “beat the speed of regulation.”

Recent actions taken to reduce plastic, as reported by the experts, include:

In the Maldives, schools have eliminated single-use plastics as of April 2018;

In the Netherlands, an affordable grocery store opened a plastic-free aisle;

The UK recently announced the Clean Oceans Alliance to reduce plastic waste in Commonwealth states;

In Switzerland, major supermarkets placed a five-cent fee for plastic bags, reducing demand by 80%.

Additional ideas were brainstormed, including:

Use extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies with regard to plastic packaging, as well as industrial fishing and the loss of gear;

Work with mineral water bottling companies to shift to other types of bottles, and hold a conference with the five largest bottled water companies in the world to secure commitments on going plastic-free;

Create legislation covering supermarkets’ responsibility, especially as some have said, “we would love to be legislated into” reducing plastic; and

Use blockchain technology to track ships, fishing nets and other aspects of fishing supply chains and manufacturing.

One participant said demand is only part of the solution, and legislation is required when producers and packagers are not ready to come to the table. A government representative said that despite regulations and laws, the petroleum industry can perpetuate a bad situation in a country through lobbying and investments.

On food loss and waste, experts including James Lomax, UN Environment, and Harry de Gorter, Cornell University, US, explained that in food and agriculture, unlike other areas of SCP, efficiency is not the problem. Calories are produced very cheaply already, which leads to consumption of the wrong food – non-diverse, high-calorie, and corn-based – in turn creating an obesity crisis. Moreover, when food is wasted, the water, energy and wildlife habitat used in creating the food are also wasted. However, decreasing production and consumption will increase prices. Redistribution of surplus is not the solution, Lomax stressed, and will only entrench the system of waste.

Participants stressed the need for consumer campaigns and public outreach, such as conducting food waste audits in schools. They also noted the importance of measurement and monitoring, such as through the food waste index led by UNEP and partners, and through initiatives to separate food waste from the waste stream.

On whether there is a business case to be made for reducing food waste, one participant said the westernization of diets is driving the crisis, and it is difficult to make a business case to address that. However, Richard Swannell, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), said businesses can experience a favorable rate of return on reducing food loss and waste in under two years, and companies that measure how much is wasted through the entire process of producing the food in the first place realize the need to reduce waste.

Regarding SDG 12’s status as the least funded SDG, participants suggesting linking food waste to other issues, highlighting that it is difficult to mobilize funding for what is perceived as a first-world problem. They also called for more measurement of gains from reducing food loss and waste, which will lead governments to invest.

73,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-secretary-general-announces-initiative-for-global-disarmament/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Secretary-General Announces Initiative for Global Disarmament,"24 May 2018: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced a vision and agenda for global disarmament, aiming to eliminate nuclear arsenals and other deadly weapons around the world. He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

The note was prepared in order to advance discussions at the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48), convening during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany.

The document (FCCC/SBSTA/2018/INF.2) provides information on cooperative activities, initiatives and programmes since the SBSTA 46. On the relationship with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the document explains that the 2030 Agenda recognizes the UNFCCC as the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and that the UNFCCC Secretariat can help countries achieve the SDGs. It describes UNFCCC activities towards SDG implementation, focusing mainly on SDG 13 (climate action), as well as engagement with activities and relevant agencies for achieving SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 15 (life on land).

The document showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with UNEP, FAO and ILO, among others.

On mitigation-related cooperative activities, the note highlights implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the role of the NDC Partnership, which supports developing countries in implementing their NDCs and achieving the SDGs. It showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with, inter alia: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to support climate and SDG-aligned finance and investment action in the context of sustainable development; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) to enhance countries’ capacities to integrate adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs into activities in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work.

On technology, the note outlines cooperation related to, inter alia, the technology facilitation mechanism to support implementation of the SDGs. It highlights the Secretariat’s participation in the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and in the high-level seminar on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

The note also describes cooperative activities related to climate finance, capacity building, adaptation and action for climate empowerment (ACE). It underscores the UNFCCC’s participation in a review forum for the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, which discussed the role of teachers and teacher training, as well as implementation of education for sustainable development in achieving SDG target 4.7 (ensuring all learners acquire knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development).

Additionally, the note provides an overview of activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) that help achieve the SDGs. On SDG target 2.4, on ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices, the document highlights the UNFCCC’s role in identifying knowledge gaps around agriculture and fisheries that hinder implementation and scaling up of adaptation.

On SDG target 5.5, on ensuring women’s participation and equal opportunities for leadership, the document references knowledge resources on gender-sensitive approaches and tools for adaptation. On SDG target 11.3, on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the note highlights a synthesis report on adaptation in human settlements, prepared under the NWP, which shares key findings, good practices and lessons learned on adaptation in human settlements. Regarding SDG target 11.B, on increasing the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing mitigation and adaptation policies and plans, the document outlines the Secretariat’s efforts to catalyze climate resilience action in human settlements through an adaptation knowledge portal.

The document also describes NWP activities related to: SDG target 6.A, on expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes; SDG target 9.A, on facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries; and SDG 13. The note also highlights the potential of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform to help advance the SDGs, particularly SDG target 13.B, on promoting mechanisms for building capacity for climate change-related planning and management for local and marginalized communities.

LDN is the third target under the Sustainable Development Goal on life on land (SDG 15).

The LDN Country Profiles aim to provide policy-makers with easily accessible and scientifically sound information that can help estimate the value of investments in land restoration and inform on the economic returns of remedial action. The assessments highlight the multiple benefits of investing in sustainable land management (SLM), which is recognized as a key factor in accelerating SDG achievement, including for: Goal 1 (No poverty), Goal 2 (Zero hunger), Goal 5 (Promote gender equality), Goal 6 (Clean water and sanitation), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and Goal 13 (Climate action).

Asia and Africa bear the highest costs of land degradation, estimated at US$84 billion and $65 billion per year, respectively.

The profiles are largely based on analytical work undertaken by the Center for Development Research of the University of Bonn, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The analysis reveals that Asia and Africa bear the highest costs of land degradation, estimated at US$84 billion and $65 billion per year, respectively. Average losses resulting from land degradation for the 21 countries are estimated at nine percent of their gross domestic product (GDP). The UNCCD points out that this figure is even higher for some of the planet’s worst affected countries, such as the Central African Republic, where the total losses are estimated at “a staggering” 40 percent.

A total of 116 out of 169 countries affected by land degradation and/or drought have made commitments to set voluntary national targets under the UNCCD’s LDN Target-Setting Programme.

76,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/publication-recommends-stronger-laws-policies-to-implement-paris-agreement/,"Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Publication Recommends Stronger Laws, Policies to Implement Paris Agreement","May 2018: The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the LSE Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, UK, in partnership with the University of Leeds, UK, and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at the Columbia Law School, New York, US, have published a policy brief highlighting global trends in climate change legislation and litigation.

The brief titled, ‘Global Trends in Climate Change Legislation and Litigation: 2018 Snapshot,’ explains that all 197 signatories or ratifiers of the Paris Agreement on climate change have at least one law or policy addressing climate change or the transition to a low-carbon economy, of which 139 countries have framework laws that address climate change mitigation or adaptation holistically. Of the more than 1,500 climate laws and policies that exist worldwide, 106 have been introduced since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, with 28 explicitly referencing the treaty, although the brief notes that further analyses will be required to determine consistency with the Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). On litigation, the publication highlights that some strategic court cases against governments that link climate and rights have been successful, with more climate-related human rights cases emerging.

Importing internationally agreed targets into national laws and policies, and translating those targets into action, will significantly impact on the Paris Agreement’s success.

The brief notes that obligations emanating from the Paris Agreement will require countries either to introduce new or strengthen existing laws and policies to keep up with increased ambition, and that stronger links between national and international agendas are still needed. It states that a “de facto” disconnect between national and international processes might prevent countries from measuring progress towards and ratcheting up their NDC ambitions. The brief explains that importing internationally agreed targets into national laws and policies, and translating those targets into action, will significantly impact on the Paris Agreement’s success.

Citing the importance of framework legislation to implement the Paris Agreement, the brief discusses the UK’s Climate Change Act, one of the earliest framework laws. Its legislative features, which are being replicated elsewhere, include: a science-based, long-term emissions target; economy-wide five-year carbon budgets; adaptation planning towards climate resilience; an independent advisory body; and mandatory progress monitoring and accountability.

The brief notes that while around 25% of laws and policies are explicitly climate change mitigation or adaptation laws, others integrate climate change into laws focused on specific sectors or activities such as energy, forestry or transport. Other laws incorporate climate change into wider frameworks, such as economic development or green growth plans, which are often consistent with meeting the SDGs.

Regarding litigation trends, the brief highlights the ‘Climate Change Litigation of the World’ database, which includes over 276 court cases across 25 national courts (excluding the US) and international bodies. While the majority of cases in the database deal with mitigation, some address adaptation, for example as it relates to coastal planning and risks from climatic hazards. Corporations are the most represented group of plaintiffs, frequently bringing cases against governments to overturn administrative decisions made on the basis of climate change. Over 800 US cases are included in a separate database, which includes more than a dozen lawsuits challenging deregulation by the US government. Other US litigation relates to, inter alia: federal government transparency; environmental review and permitting; municipality-led suits against fossil fuel companies; state-led efforts to decarbonize electricity; and liability for failure to adapt.

Strategic climate litigation, the brief notes, is increasingly challenging governments and corporations on climate action, pushing courts to examine linkages between climate change and rights protection. It influences policy by urging mitigation, adaptation and compensation. Litigation also affects corporate behavior and strategies, with plaintiffs seeking compensation from carbon producers for climate change-related damage. Even unsuccessful litigation contributes to increased long-term climate action as it raises awareness, and leads to a broader public discussion on climate change-related issues.

The guide titled, ‘Creating a Sustainable Future: The Role of the Accountant in Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals,’ details how businesses and management accountants can benefit from SDG-related opportunities, and how finance professionals can help achieve an organization’s social and socio-economic objectives.

The guide underscores the fundamental role of business in delivering on the SDGs, including by creating jobs, enabling access to healthcare, innovating new technologies, and spearheading the development and responsible use of resources like energy and water. It also provides examples of ways in which organizations in different sectors and across geographic regions are already contributing to and meeting requirements of the SDGs.

Management accountants play an important role in making the business case for pursuing appropriate SDGs.

According to the report, management accountants play an important role in making the business case for pursuing appropriate SDGs, monitoring and evaluating their impact, and ensuring alignment of sustainability initiatives with corporate activities. Moreover, they can: encourage businesses to meet SDG requirements through improved innovation capabilities; emphasize the importance of ethical behavior throughout the value chain; provide decision makers with information about sustainability factors, which can be integrated into business planning and reporting; focus more on best practice in governance and stewardship; help form strategic partnerships; and help businesses base their corporate reports on the six “capitals” of integrated reporting: human, social and relationship, intellectual, natural, manufacturing and financial.

The report recommends that accountants and their employers should focus on those SDGs most relevant to their industry, sector and business type. It includes tools and methods to help businesses manage reputational risk, respond to globalization, digitization and the impacts of policy changes and meet investor demand for greater reporting transparency. The guide suggests that management accountants’ skill sets (expertise in governance, risk management and control, business analysis and decision support), organizational role and ethical commitment place the profession at the forefront of SDG planning and implementation.

The guide also provides steps that employees can take to determine: whether their employers are aligning with and contributing to the SDGs; how business and organizations are making a difference with respect to each of the SDGs; and how to build the SDGs into organizational culture and thinking. Regarding the latter, the report proposes: building the SDGs into organizational strategies and business; engaging supply chain partners and company ecosystems with the SDGs; reporting on the SDGs as part of integrated reporting; and building the “learn and relearn” feedback loop into planning and strategy development.

The plan, known as the ‘Hoja de Ruta,’ identifies five priority areas for implementing the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and links each area to available partner and programme resources from across the NDC Partnership.

The priorities are: revising the country’s NDC; prioritizing mitigation and adaptation efforts; developing roadmaps for prioritized actions and signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) with partners; establishing a monitoring, reporting and evaluation system; and strengthening inter-institutional coordination for climate action.

To deliver on these priorities, the plan identifies 21 activities, to be implemented over the next three years, including: a comprehensive review of the country’s NDC; development of a national climate change investment plan; data collection and monitoring; capacity building; and increased public awareness. Annual review of the plan will seek to ensure inclusion of emerging priorities and reflection of progress.

Honduras is also developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support. The country has created institutional enablers for coordinated climate action, including the Presidential Office for Climate Change, climate change units within government institutions, and a multi-stakeholder national commission on climate change.

Honduras is developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support.

To highlight country experiences in developing Partnership Plans, the NDC Partnership hosted a side event on 8 May 2018 on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which convened from 30 April to 10 May. The side event titled, ‘Partnership Plan for NDC Implementation: Connecting the Dots,’ offered six member countries (Honduras, Jordan, Kenya, Mongolia, the Netherlands and Uganda) the opportunity to share their perspectives on and lessons learnt from Partnership Plans and NDC implementation. The event addressed such issues as gender in climate change action, working with global development partners, challenges faced when dealing with multiple government agencies, and the value and challenges of the Partnership Plan as a tool to implement and enhance ambition of NDCs.

Mongolia highlighted his country’s efforts to automate the Partnership Plan through an online portal, which will have an interactive interface to enable government representatives and development partners to update and share information on projects, initiatives and sustainable development priorities.

The Netherlands emphasized that the country engagement process contributes to improving donor coordination, transparency, and encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach.

Launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016, and hosted by the UNFCCC and the World Resources Institute (WRI), the NDC Partnership is a coalition of countries and institutions committed to advancing climate and development action. Partnership Plans are part of the NDC Partnership’s in-country engagement work, matching needs of countries with resources from other Partnership members through a government-led process that is flexible, supports transparency, enhances coordination among in-country and global actors, and mobilizes support for NDC implementation.

Launched during the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 30 April to 10 May, the report recalls that the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the UNFCCC resulted in, inter alia: almost US$1 billion in financial commitments to address climate change; the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue, which aims to inform and inspire Parties as they increase their commitments; the first-ever Gender Action Plan; a platform for indigenous peoples and local communities aimed at the exchange of knowledge, technologies and practices; and an agreement on agriculture.

The report discusses goals for the year ahead, including: increasing the number of ratifications of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol so it can enter into force; concluding the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue in the lead up to and during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland; and adopting the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) by the end of 2018 at COP 24.

The report acknowledges links between the Paris Agreement on climate change, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), whereby action in one area benefits the others, and, in the words of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, pursuing the three together “increase[s] impact and efficiency” and helps transform peoples’ lives and ensure a healthy planet.

The report highlights the Law and Climate Change Toolkit, piloted in 2017 to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

On increasing the ability of countries to report on emissions, UN Climate Change 2017 activities included: training programmes for review experts on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and on biennial reports (BRs) and national communications (NCs); a handbook for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV); and regional training sessions and expos to help national experts prepare and finance national adaptation plans (NAPs), and align them with the SDGs.

The report highlights that, in 2017, the Adaptation Committee shared good practice on accessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and provided advice to Parties through the adaptation finance bulletin. In addition, the Secretariat launched the following: the Adaptation Knowledge Portal, which includes information and knowledge resources on enhancing climate resilience; NAP Central, a hub of information on creating and implementing NAPs; and ‘The Adaptation Exchange’ Facebook page, which disseminates knowledge, engages stakeholders and provides learning opportunities. At COP 23, the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) launched the Fiji Clearing House for Risk Transfer to help Parties develop and implement risk management and connect with risk transfer experts.

The report also provides an overview of climate financing, including: the GCF, with 76 projects and programmes, amounting to US$3.7 billion in direct funding and US$8.9 billion in co-financing; the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$4.2 billion in direct funding and US$38.2 billion through co-financing for over 1,000 mitigation projects, and over US$8 billion mobilized for adaptation; and the Adaptation Fund, which, as of March 2018, had committed US$476 million for adaptation and resilience activities in 74 countries. The Secretariat and the regional collaboration centres (RCCs) initiated the Green Investment Catalyst Roundtable to mobilize private sector finance for implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

On technology, the report notes that the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) launched three publications, and organized two major events, namely an innovation and climate change event, and a thematic dialogue on industrial energy efficiency and material substitution. The publications include: ‘South-South Cooperation and Triangular Cooperation on Technologies for Adaptation in the Water and Agriculture Sectors’; ‘Technological Innovation for the Paris Agreement,’ which highlights ways in which innovation can accelerate NDC and NAP implementation; and ‘Industrial Energy and Material Efficiency,’ which recommends policies for scaling up use of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial sector.

On building new partnerships, the publication reports that the Secretariat used COP 23 to pilot an initiative to establish links with a range of stakeholders on innovative ways to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention. During Climate Week in New York in September 2017, the Marrakech Partnership launched the Climate Action Leadership Network. At COP 23, the inaugural Yearbook of Global Climate Action was launched, showcasing the results of the Marrakech Partnership.

On developing effective climate legislation, the report notes, the Secretariat, together with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, piloted the Law and Climate Change Toolkit to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

Also, the report highlights an Asia-Pacific Climate Action Agenda developed under the Nairobi Framework Partnership (NFP) to promote enhanced pre-2020 ambition and the employment of carbon pricing instruments and policies, and improve access to finance.

The ongoing preparatory phase of the Talanoa Dialogue is expected to continue deliberations on its three questions related to countries’ efforts to combat climate change: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there?

The Talanoa Dialogue’s preparatory phase started in January 2018 and will last until December, to be followed by a political phase at the Katowice Climate Change Conference.

The Bonn Climate Change Conference comprises meetings of three bodies: the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 48), the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48) and the fifth part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-5).

Some of the main issues under negotiation in Bonn relate to the Paris Agreement’s cyclical and iterative nature.

The agendas of the three bodies cover a range of issues, including the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) and a set of decisions required to operationalize the Paris Agreement on climate change, on which the Bonn Climate Change Conference is expected to focus.

Some of the main issues under negotiation in Bonn relate to the Paris Agreement’s cyclical and iterative nature. They include Parties updating their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) at five-year intervals, regular reports on progress under a transparency and accountability framework, and convening a global stocktake (GST) every five years to assess collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s goals.

Related discussions in the negotiations focus on, inter alia: information that could improve the clarity, transparency and understanding of NDCs; NDC features; accounting for NDCs; and the transparency framework for action and support, which includes reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and financial support provided to developing countries. Deliberations will also center on matters relating to the GST, common timeframes for NDCs, and modalities and procedures for the NDC registry.

Other PAWP themes to be discussed in Bonn include: the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement; accounting of financial resources provided and mobilized through public interventions; and recognizing developing countries’ adaptation efforts. Delegates will also consider adaptation communication, the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures, and cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which include market and non-market based approaches.

Ahead of the meeting, FAO published a synthesis report of existing scientific research titled, ‘Soil Pollution: A Hidden Reality,’ warning that pollution poses a worrisome threat to agricultural productivity, food safety, and human health, but “far too little is known about the scale and severity of that threat.”

Around 500 soil experts, policy makers and other stakeholders attended the GSOP18, which was co-organized by FAO’s Global Soil Partnership (GSP) and Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS), UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment), the Secretariats of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS Conventions Secretariat), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Symposium aimed to contribute to implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by serving as a platform to assess the latest information on the status, trends, and actions on soil pollution.

Participants assessed the status of soil pollution worldwide and explored options for its prevention as well as remediation. Specific themes included: the impact of agricultural fields and other land uses; the impact of soil pollution on food production and safety, the environment and overall human well-being; remediation of polluted sites; and developing policies and setting thresholds for addressing soil pollution and the global status of soil pollution.

The FAO synthesis report found, inter alia, that: production of chemicals has grown rapidly in recent decades and is projected to increase annually by 3.4 percent until 2030; in 2015, the European chemical industry produced 319 million tons of chemicals, of which nearly half were deemed hazardous to the environment; and levels of persistent organic pollutants in human milk are significantly above those considered safe, with a higher incidence in India and in some European and African countries. The report also raised concern about a near-doubling of the amount of manure left on pasture, which can contain high amounts of heavy metals, pathogen organisms and antibiotics. Other sources of soil pollution highlighted in the report include approximately 110 million mines or other unexploded pieces of ordnance that are scattered across 64 countries on all continents, and high concentrations of radionuclides in “almost all soil in the northern hemisphere.”

Ongoing GSP initiatives to track the global status of soil pollution were highlighted, notably the 2015 Status of the World’s Soil Resources report, and the 2017 Global Assessment of the Impact of Plant Protection Products on Soil Functions and Soil Ecosystems, which is one of the follow up actions to the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management that were adopted by the GSP in 2016. The role of the BRS Conventions in coordinating the phase-out of persistent organic pollutants (POPs); production of global norms for sound environmental management; and fostering partnerships with stakeholders was highlighted. The meeting also discussed the implementation of the 2017 UN Environment Assembly Resolution on soil pollution.

Building on diverse national and regional case studies of soil pollution featured at the meeting, participants highlighted organic compounds and emerging contaminants as one of the main challenges. They called for a global assessment of soil pollution that includes modeling chemical production and emissions, prioritizes highly contaminated sites, and assesses, at country level, the main contaminants and impacts. The importance of developing accessible technologies to assess soil pollution was also emphasized.

During the closing session, the GSP Secretariat announced plans to establish two working groups to continue work on some of the key issues addressed at the Symposium. The two groups will focus, respectively, on developing guidelines for assessing, mapping, monitoring and reporting on soil pollution, and managing soil pollution. ITPS and its partners are developing an outcome document from the Symposium that will summarize the scientific evidence and data presented, as well as ideas for overcoming existing challenges and future steps, that will serve as a road map for the ‘Be the solution to soil pollution’ campaign and other future actions.

The GSP was established under FAO in 2012 as a mechanism to develop an interactive partnership and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders, to improve the governance of and promote sustainable soil management. The ITPS was established at the first GSP Plenary Assembly in 2013 and is composed of 27 top soil experts from all regions. Its main function is to provide scientific and technical advice on global soil issues to the GSP and to specific requests by global or regional institutions.

The Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management were adopted by the 4th GSP Plenary Assembly and endorsed by the 155th session of the FAO Council in 2016. They provide technical and policy recommendations on achieving sustainable soil management.

UN officials also stressed the Territories’ particular vulnerability to climate change.

The meeting convened from 9-11 May 2018, in St. George’s, Grenada, organized by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization. Participants discussed ways to advance gains made in the Territories under the Special Committee’s purview, with many encouraging dialogue with their respective administering Powers, namely France, New Zealand, UK and US.

Currently, 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories (NSGTs) remain to be decolonized. They are: (Africa) Western Sahara; (Atlantic and Caribbean) Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Montserrat, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands, and US Virgin Islands; (Europe) Gibraltar; and (Pacific) American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Pitcairn and Tokelau.

Committee Chair Walton Alfonso Webson recalled that following the adoption of the SDGs, the Committee had stressed the importance of fostering economic and social sustainable development of the Territories. He said that conclusions from the last seminar acknowledged that climate change had exposed many of the Territories to even greater environmental and economic vulnerability. He called for efforts to continue strengthening administrative capacity, good governance and economic sustainability.

In a message to the seminar, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said “decolonization is still incomplete,” and cannot be advanced until Non-Self-Governing Territories can address a range of economic, social and environmental challenges. He emphasized that implementing the SDGs is important for Territories facing the challenges of climate change, access to health care, economic diversification, marine resource conservation and scarcity of drinking water.

During discussions, speakers highlighted: realization of the SDGs in the Territories is related to the extent to which the UN system provides the political space for their engagement; that achieving the Goals will increase possibilities for further advancement of self-government; the need for a mechanism to enable SDG implementation; and that the Special Committee should undertake discussions on the future development agenda in parallel with its decolonization efforts.

A number of speakers emphasized that the Territories cannot realize the SDGs if their economic dependency continues. One speaker said that in Puerto Rico, following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, it had taken three weeks for the response to get under way. Countries with full sovereignty are able to receive aid and take decisions on economic development policies more quickly. Cuba said it had not been permitted to provide aid to Puerto Rico following the hurricanes. Others cited “deliberate foot-dragging” by administering Powers, inhibiting Territories from taking action to ensure an effective response to climate-related events.

Also to improve Territories’ ability to achieve the SDGs, speakers called for increased communication between the UN Special Committee and administering Powers. They discussed how the Committee can help ensure that Territories serve as owners and drivers of the SDGs, and pointed to the importance of capacity building.

An elected official from a local council in Western Sahara highlighted a project on agriculture that will create jobs and efforts to promote tourism. Morocco noted its investments in the Western Sahara in such areas as public infrastructure and services, and said the Territory’s level of human development has surpassed Morocco’s national average. A representative from French Polynesia noted the development of SDG indicators within the framework of the Pacific Island Forum (PIF).

On the UN’s role in helping Territories achieve the SDGs, representatives of UN agencies drew attention to: the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) strategy for technical cooperation with the six UK Caribbean Territories, which will be in place until 2022; the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) technical support for a sexual and reproductive health policy for Anguilla, and its provision of emergency sexual and reproductive health kits to the Turks and Caicos Islands following Hurricane Irma; and UN Women’s efforts in BVI and Anguilla on gender-related issues.

85,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/eu-issues-waste-management-rules-for-circular-economy/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,EU Issues Waste Management Rules for Circular Economy,"22 May 2018: The EU has issued a set of waste management directives as part of a broader Circular Economy Action Plan adopted in December 2015. The new rules aim to prevent waste and increase recycling.



The legislation approved by EU Member States aims to strengthen the European waste hierarchy, which prioritizes actions to take at products’ end of life. The hierarchy first seeks to prevent waste, then aims to prepare for, in order of preference, materials’ reuse, recycling, recovery or disposal.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights a need for improved waste management, including through SDGs 6, 11 and 12, as well as paragraph 34 of the declaration. SDG target 12.5 specially calls on Member States to “substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.” The new EU rules set recycling targets for municipal and packaging waste, starting in 2025 and increasing the percentage of waste to be recycled, in five-year increments. The EU targets on packaging waste are material-specific (plastic, wood, glass, aluminum, etc.), with an overarching goal of recycling 65% of packaging waste by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2030.

The rules demand separation of materials, which has implications for municipal governments and existing waste collection infrastructure. By separating materials prior to collection, the EU aims to increase the quality and purity of collected waste streams, enabling the materials to be reused or fed into new production processes, thereby increasing circularity within the EU economy. To this end, the rules feature a longer-term goal on landfilling to be met by 2035. Recognizing that landfills pollute soils, groundwater and air, the directive restricts municipal waste sent to landfills to no more than ten percent of the total amount generated. The realization of these targets also will enable EU Member States to contribute directly to SDG target 11.6, which identifies municipal and other waste management systems as means of reducing cities’ adverse environmental impacts.

SDG achievement requires not just coordination across government mechanisms, but also the whole of society. The waste management legislation builds on previous efforts to engage non-state actors in the private sector, by using economic instruments and other incentives to drive extended producer responsibility (EPR). Under EPR schemes, the producer of a product or material is also responsible for it at the end of its life – as seen in phone and clothing take-back programmes. Without landfilling as an option due to the above target, waste producers and collectors will need to improve the reuse and recycling of materials, and incorporate “design for the environment” principles that increase a product’s recyclability or reuse at the end of its life.

Doing so may imply products’ being designed for simplicity or modularity, such that their components can be reused or their materials recycled with minimal effort. In both the electronics and textile industries, products are becoming increasingly complicated, using a wider range of elements and materials that ultimately hinders their ability to be reused or recycled at the end of their life as a product.

Through the passage of new rules aiming to achieve a circular economy, the EU and others can directly contribute to a broad swath of SDGs linked to material consumption and waste production. The European Commission’s press release also notes that the legislation aims to halt both food waste and marine litter, in close alignment with SDG targets 12.3 on food waste and 14.1 on marine pollution.

86,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/p4r-network-releases-comparative-analysis-of-2017-vnrs/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,P4R Network Releases Comparative Analysis of 2017 VNRs,"April 2018: In a “non-paper” analyzing the 43 Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) submitted to the 2017 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the transnational multi-stakeholder network Partners for Review (P4R) discusses institutional mechanisms for review processes, participation of non-state actors, and statistics and data for the SDGs. Per the paper, almost all the 43 VNRs outline the importance of communication and public awareness regarding the SDGs, and approximately 20 of them refer directly to communication strategies or campaigns targeting the general public.

Two independent consultants on behalf of the P4R secretariat produced the non-paper titled, ‘Comparative Analysis of 43 VNRs Submitted to the HLPF 2017.’ It assesses VNRs from the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.

The paper finds that VNR reports vary in many aspects, such as length, structure, and thematic coverage, and that references to national follow-up and review “come in many different shapes and sizes.” For instance, it notes that some VNRs use the term “follow-up” to describe implementation, while others use it as a heading to explain their next steps, and some interpret “review” as “reporting,” although both terms are used interchangeably, with an emphasis on monitoring progress. The paper outlines challenges related to the SDG process, including on: monitoring, evaluation and statistical capacity; general data availability and difficulty of compiling and using disaggregated data; alignment of national strategies and plans, and of institutions; and financing and resource mobilization.

The authors find that the main institutional mechanisms steering the overall SDG process are assigning the responsibility to a specific ministry, or to a cross-sectoral (and sometimes multi-stakeholder) committee or council. Per the report, 23 countries have assigned the lead for SDG implementation to a specific ministry or to the offices of the Presidency or the Prime Minister, and a smaller number of countries are building on pre-existing sustainable-development related councils, commissions or committees to coordinate SDG planning and review. The authors also note that 16 countries have “recently” established lead councils, commissions or committees to steer and coordinate implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and that the 2017 VNRs indicate “an increasing recognition” of sub-national level actors and institutions as key to successful SDG implementation, compared to 2016.

According to the paper, all 43 VNRs describe efforts to ensure participation of non-state actors (civil society, private sector and academia) in the SDG process, with some devoting entire chapters or annexes to individual stakeholder groups, describing their roles, the mechanisms of their involvement and/or their contributions to the implementation of specific SDGs. The two main approaches used for non-state actor involvement are representation in institutionalized committees, and participation in special consultations, the paper notes, but both are not mutually exclusive. It adds that while some countries engage in special projects or partnerships with the private sector, countries have established private-sector or academic advisory committees in very few cases.

On statistics and data, the 2017 VNRs show considerable variation, according to the P4R paper, with countries providing different levels and structures of disaggregated data, from “mere numerical presentation” to charts, graphs and verbal explanations, and with statistical annexes ranging from one to more than 100 pages. The paper also outlines few references to the use of non-official data, with 14 countries mentioning big or other “alternative” data. Six VNRs mention data contributed by civil-society and other stakeholders.

P4R is a transnational multi-stakeholder network composed of government representatives and stakeholders from civil society, the private sector and academia. Initiated “on behalf” of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, P4R facilitates dialogue and peer learning on SDG challenges, provides space to explore best practices and lessons learned, and shares expertise on new and emerging issues related to national monitoring and review processes.

The non-paper was prepared in advance of a P4R meeting that took place from 11-12 April 2018, in Tbilisi, Georgia. It adds to a series of reports consolidating and analyzing VNRs, such as the report ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the VNR Reports Submitted to the HLPF in 2017’ published by the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC), in collaboration with other civil society organizations. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has also issued synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs, as well as a compendium that synthesizes institutional arrangements adopted by the 64 countries that presented their VNRs during the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the HLPF.

87,https://thefifthestate.com.au/business/finance/alphinity-adds-to-sustainable-investment-options-with-sdg-principles/,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Fifth Estate,Alphinity adds to sustainable investment options with SDG principles,"Elaine Prior, the highly regarded former ESG analyst with Citigroup, and Mark Lyster, who has also forged a well-regarded track record in sustainability, have been appointed advisers to a new Australian-based investment fund that will aim to abide by the principles of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Alphinity Sustainable Share Fund fund will be small to start – around $25 million to date – but its managers hope it will reach greater heights.

Lonsec has given the fund a “highly recommended” rating because of its “boutique” ownership structure and combination of quantitative and fundamental analysis in its investment philosophy, a statement from Alphinity said.

Its portfolio selection pool will be just 35 to 55 of the ASX top 300. The variation around 20 of the companies is to provide for slippage in sustainable performance that might follow an accident, at a mine for instance (the company includes investment in some miners).

“Sustainability is not just an add-on or a ‘bumper sticker’,” the fund said in a media statement, and was “at the core of this fund”.

“For example, we will not support companies which generate more than 10 per cent of their revenues from producing or operating high impact fuels such as uranium, thermal coal, coal seam gas, oil sands and arctic drilling, which are considered environmentally unfriendly and for which sustainable alternatives exist.”

According to principal and fund manager Bruce Smith the 10 per cent or less income from these sectors is cumulative.

Bruce Smith

Asked why any exposure was acceptable in such a sustainable fund Mr Smith told The Fifth Estateon Thursday that a target of 10 per cent maximum threshold would allow incidental exposure, maybe through secondary investments and would prevent an otherwise strong performing sustainable company from being excluded.

“You need some threshold. If you had zero you’d end up with funny consequences, and knocking out potential companies that are quite positive but have incidental exposure to those things. It constrains your universe.”

An example was a mining company that had a small exposure to thermal coal. You need some sort of threshold and then it’s an argument about how much you think is modest.”

Principal and portfolio manager Stephane Andre said the fund would

excludes companies involved in gold mining, animal mistreatment, old growth forest logging, predatory lending and hostile debt collection, and pornography.

“It will however invest in some companies in extractive industries, as the provision of certain commodities are vital if you want to achieve sustainable development,” Mr Andre said.

Mr Smith said the fund would perform as if it were a $750 million fund purely to focus its investments in bigger companies that provided liquidity.

“We never really want to put a number (for fund size) out there but we’re taking running the fund running as if it’s a $750 million fund, presuming it’s bigger than it is, which means the stocks we look at investing in are liquid and can be able to get in and out of.”

Demand for sustainable ethical investment was strong, he said. Alphinity previously had a socially responsible share fund for seven-and-a-half years, which had performed reasonably well – two-plus per cent above the ASX average before fees of 0.95 percentage points, but the fund was more of a negative screen.

The new fund would encompass a positive screen methodology to stock picking.

“We felt there is space in the market for a fund that has more positivity, that was contributing to society and with the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals it was really a way to do that and set up a framework for companies that are good.”

A big difficulty, he said, was to strike a balance between good market performance and sustainability performance. Gaming technology company Aristocrat, for instance, had performed very well but could not be included in such a fund.

Not everyone wants to sacrifice financial performance, he said.

Mr Smith said the fund was “certainly getting a lot of interest”.

“It’s the first we know of that addresses the SDGs in a tangible way and it’s piquing a lot of interest.”

There was not a lot of competition in the space.

“The Mercer table is 100 equities funds and maybe 8-10 ethical sustainable funds.”

There was also a geographical distinction.

The funds run by Morphic Asset Management were global for instance, while Alphinity was purely Australian focused.

The Alphinity SSF was recently awarded the Lonsec/Money Management Fund Manager of the Year award in the Responsible Investment category.

Stephane Andre

A media briefing early this year revealed that the growth of ethical investing, locally and globally, showed no signs of slowing down as the knowledge that there is no financial penalty – rather benefits – became well understood.

The briefing by BetaShares revealed that the ethical investment industry had hit a critical mass and was rapidly gaining market share.

Morgan Stanley head of wealth management research Nathan Lim (formerly of Australian Ethical) said in Australia “core” responsibly invested assets (including deep green investments that apply screening, sustainability-themed investment and impact/community investing) hit $64.9 billion in 2016, and were rapidly gaining market share (currently at five per cent), growing by 26 per cent in just one year.

Between 2006-12, the growth rate had been on average three per cent, but since then “something has clicked”.","The Alphinity Sustainable Share Fund fund will be small to start – around $25 million to date – but its managers hope it will reach greater heights.

SDGs are an ambitious commitment by the world’s leaders to ensure that people across the world enjoy peace and prosperity and also achieve environmental sustainability by 2030.

SDGs comprise 17 goals, which include ending poverty and hunger, quality education, gender equality, clean water, sanitation and energy.

In India, the Prime Minister’s Office had last year appointed NITI Aayog as the supervising agency for SDGs to improve India’s global performance.

“The index will help the government spur healthy competition among states to deliver on social and environment sectors. Besides, it will be an important tool for policy analysis that can help channelize energy and focus in the right direction,"" said a senior government official who is part of the exercise, on condition of anonymity.

Some of the best performing states according to the index are Assam, Gujarat, Jharkhand and West Bengal, he said.

A NITI Aayog official confirmed the development.

“This index will measure the performance of states on the priority and scheme indicators and highlight the efforts being made by each state in achieving the SDG agenda. The initiative highlights the importance accorded by India towards the SDG agenda and the country’s willingness to implement it,"" said the official.

According to the index report prepared by the think tank, the SDGs will offer an actionable framework that can help state governments evaluate their performance on social, economic and environmental parameters.

90,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-solo,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Solo’,"Watching Disney’s Solo is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers.

In the 40-plus years since Star Wars took the box office and pop culture by storm, no plot point or line of dialogue, however essential or trivial, has avoided endless scrutiny and second-guessing from fans and skeptics alike.

How could the Death Star’s catastrophic vulnerability, so obvious that Rebel analysts spotted it immediately, have been overlooked by Imperial engineers? How could Han Solo boast that the Millennium Falcon “made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” when a parsec is a unit of distance, not time?

Watching Disney’s Rogue One and Solo, the two stand-alone “Star Wars Story” movies that come without episode numbers and opening crawls, is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers … as new leaks burst all around him.

Rogue One proposed that the Death Star’s weakness was secretly intentionally engineered by an Imperial saboteur. Yet, when the saboteur contacted the Rebels, he inexplicably didn’t simply tell them the vulnerability, potentially pre-empting the horrific battle for the plans and the whole plot of Star Wars. (That’s before we get to Darth Vader in Star Wars arguing, “If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?” when, following Rogue One, he should be saying “LOL, I literally chased you here from the scene of the crime.”)

Now, thanks to Solo, “making the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” finally makes sense. It’s just that, also thanks to Solo, it makes no sense for Han to cite this as evidence that the Falcon is a fast ship. Given Solo’s version of the Kessel Run affair, the Falcon could be the slowest hunk of junk in the galaxy and still do it in under 12 parsecs. Speed is literally irrelevant. Han’s curious boast is emptier than ever.

If it seems disproportionate to spend four or five paragraphs in this review basically addressing one line in another movie, consider that Solo spends possibly 45 minutes basically addressing the same line — and still makes a hash of it.

I will write this review in less than a day, for a paycheck that is less than 1/100th the cost of a single second of Solo’s running time. (With a reported $250 million budget, Solo is the most expensive Star Wars movie ever made. The average cost of each second of its 135-minute screen time is more than $38,000.) More people will watch Solo on opening day than will ever read this review. So, really, what’s disproportionate?

Co-written by veteran Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jonathan, directed with unswerving vanilla competence by Ron Howard (taking the reins after Lego Movie maestros Phil Lord and Christopher Miller lost a no-confidence vote with Disney brass), Solo isn’t terrible by any means.

We meet young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) as an orphaned delinquent surviving the mean streets of Corellia with his girlfriend Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke). In the course of time, each of them winds up in the company of interplanetary criminals. Han joins a gang of outlaws led by a cantankerous desperado named Beckett (Woody Harrelson), while Qi’ra becomes right-hand girl to the silky-voiced crime lord Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany).

Fans will be rewarded with decent accounts of how Han and Chewbacca first met and how Han won the Falcon fair and square from the flamboyant gambler Lando Calrissian, played with wit and charisma by a terrific Donald Glover. There are also answers to questions no one was asking, like where the surname “Solo” came from. (Turns out it’s not just an on-the-nose character name.)

If that last is a bit of a groaner, there’s nothing here like the wince-inducing dialogue or wooden acting of George Lucas’s prequel trilogy. On the other hand, there’s nothing like their visionary quality either.

It may be hard to recall, but there was a time when one of the main pleasures of a Star Wars movie, including the prequels, was being taken to places the likes of which no movie had ever taken us and seeing things we had never seen before.

From the seemingly endless underbelly of the Imperial Star Destroyer in Star Wars’ opening shot to The Empire Strikes Back’s chaotic 3-D obstacle-course chase sequence through an asteroid field, from the groundbreaking puppet work of Yoda and Jabba the Hutt to the breathtaking cityscapes of the Naboo capital and Courscant, Star Wars was always dazzling us with unprecedented visions and vistas.

Technological innovation was responsible for a lot of that visual novelty, of course, but poetic imagination was also part of the equation.

J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens at least offered a few memorably evocative images, like the immense hulk of a long-ruined Star Destroyer on the surface of Rey’s home planet. Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi had, among other things, that haunting silent sequence in which Laura Dern’s character singlehandedly took out the enemy flagship by ramming it at light speed.

Is there a single novel visual in Solo that lingers in the imagination?

Perhaps the sinuous, spine-like articulated monorail train wending its way around snowcapped mountains in the train robbery set piece — a Western-inspired sequence honoring Han’s gunslinger vibe — expands our visual horizons a bit. I’m at a loss to think of much else.

And even that train robbery sequence doesn’t have the visual impact it could have, partly because, like so much of the movie, it’s bleakly underlit and has a flat, washed-out look.

Where Revenge of the Sith was full of (what looked like) spectacular golden-hour late-afternoon cinematography, a lot of Solo is set in dull, hazy landscapes bereft of sunlight or shadows. For a film that’s supposed to be a sort of space Western, that’s an odd choice.

Solo is the first film in the new Disney franchise with a white male lead. Besides Qi’ra, there are two notable female characters: Beckett’s partner and significant other Val, played by Thandie Newton, and Lando’s robotic companion L3-37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge), a woke navigator droid whose bitterly sarcastic commentary on the subjugation of droids is an explicit extension of the implicit feminism and racial diversity of earlier installments.

Despite this lip service to diversity, Solo’s female characters fare poorly. Vague spoiler warning: One of them chooses a stupid, pointless fate in the service of an unnecessary plot point, accomplishing nothing in the process.

Another is scarcely better served, while the third makes a crucial choice that might be called empowering, but doesn’t seem to fit the character or to have the emotional impact it ought to have, especially in a film that wants to be a Han Solo origin story.

The thing is, Ehrenreich’s young Han is a far cry — too far — from the aloof Bogartesque cynic indelibly embodied by Harrison Ford through two of the first three Star Wars films. I can imagine young Han becoming colder and harder, but not becoming less empathic.

Our hero might be a slick operator and an outlaw, but he’s also a sensitive, compassionate guy. Per the astute observation of my friend Emily Snyder (of Patheos’ “Pop Feminist” blog), with whom I saw the film, it’s hard to imagine the Han whose only answer to Leia’s declaration of love was “I know” having a history of such emotional availability as we see in his relationship with Qi’ra.

On the other end of the spectrum (or at least another end) is Lando’s relationship with L3-37. L3 bluntly remarks that Lando has an unrequited romantic attraction to her. There’s even a vague exchange about how such a pairing would “work” (L3 indicates that it’s possible).

It would be one thing if it were an open question whether Lando’s feelings were real or a figment of L3’s overheated cybernetic imagination. But no, clearly his “love” is true. This is how Disney says “Love is love” in a Star Wars movie in 2018.

“Everybody needs someone,” says Val. Her interracial relationship with Beckett is a welcome Star Wars first, I think, given that Billy Dee Williams’ Lando got nowhere with Leia. If Leia were at all flattered by Lando’s admiration, she might have felt differently had she known just how undiscriminating his tastes could be.

It’s not a total waste of time. There’s a clever plot twist or two and some worthwhile creature design. Ehrenreich’s performance is engaging on its own terms, and the film takes a big leap forward when Glover shows up.

Is that enough? For a certain type of Star Wars fan, it may be. It has to be. This is what Star Wars is now — and what it will be for the foreseeable future.

91,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word,"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Pope Francis: A Man of His Word’,"Veteran filmmaker Wim Wenders’ documentary sets out to connect the dots from one of the Church’s most beloved saints to the current pope.

Pope Francis: A Man of His Word opens with a God’s-eye view on a city that is neither Rome nor Buenos Aires. It is Assisi, where a visionary named Francis challenged all of Christendom with his radical reappropriation of the Gospel: his joyful celebration of the evangelical counsels, his enthusiastic embrace of poverty and of the poor and outcast, his celebration of the natural world, and his peacemaking efforts between Christians and Muslims, including his famed visit to the Sultan al-Kamil.

Wim Wenders, whose eclectic career has embraced arthouse dramas, documentaries, music videos and concert films, approaches the subject of his latest nonfiction film from an unusual perspective: the significance of an unprecedented papal name.

St. Francis of Assisi has long been among the most beloved of Catholic saints, even among those who don’t share his faith, and his most consequential 21st-century namesake remains popular among both Catholics and non-Catholics. Wenders sets out to connect the dots between the medieval Italian friar and the 21st-century Argentinian Pope, making the case that behind their widespread appeal is a message the world needs to hear.

A movie is only as good as its villain, and Wenders’ opening voice-over invokes nothing less than the problem of suffering and evil: natural disasters; terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; threats to the environment and extinction of species. Against this backdrop the “radical answers” of these two men named Francis stand out with fresh urgency.

Neither the life nor the papacy of the former Jorge Bergoglio is Wenders’ subject. Instead, Pope Francis focuses on characteristic themes of his preaching and teaching — particularly those most accessible to viewers of any faith or of none — as well as the engaging personality and common touch with which he advocates them.

These include Francis’ advocacy for the poor, immigrants and refugees; the perils of consumerism and the problem of unjust distribution of wealth; stewardship of the environment and an integral ecology; the horror of war and international arms trade; and the importance of understanding and peaceful coexistence among the world’s religions.

Francis himself brings these themes to viewers, looking and speaking straight into the camera in excerpts of interviews shot for the film in various Vatican City locations, including the Vatican Gardens. Intercut with these interview clips are images from globe-hopping pastoral visits to the Americas, Africa, the Philippines and elsewhere, with the Pope interacting with children, prisoners, hospital volunteers, refugees and disaster victims. The flow of images is subtly enhanced by an unobtrusive string-based score (mostly bowed instruments with an occasional guitar).

As a final touch, Wenders highlights the Franciscan foundations of the Pope’s concerns with evocative footage shot to look like clips from some lost silent-era St. Francis movie that I now wish really existed. (Wenders cross-fades into the first of these clips, shot on a hand-cranked camera from the 1920s, from one of Giotto’s frescoes in the Upper Church of Assisi’s Basilica of St. Francis which the silent footage matches perfectly.)

Focusing on Franciscan answers to global problems means, on the one hand, that Pope Francis is wholly positive in tone. Whatever tensions exist between Francis’ message and his personal failings, or whatever stumbles, gaffes or controversy have marked his papacy, are beyond the scope of Wenders’ interest.

As Pope Francis talks about the horrific crime of child sexual abuse and the necessity of holding accountable guilty priests and complicit bishops, viewers may think of the still-unfolding crisis in Chile, regarding which the Pope has acknowledged “grave errors” on his part, but the film leaves viewers to wrestle with such tensions on their own.

On the other hand, Wenders’ approach truncates Francis’ thought in various ways.

For one thing, there’s little sense of the theological vision underpinning his preaching. Little is said about Jesus — a reference to Jesus crucified in a discussion of theodicy is a notable exception — and nothing at all about Satan or hell, topics particularly notable in the Pope’s preaching.

Ideological selectivity is a factor. The controversial line “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord … who am I to judge him?” is included, but not Francis’ critical views on gender theory. The environmental and economic concerns of Laudato Si (Care for Our Common Home) are emphasized, but there’s no mention of Francis’ indictment of abortion as part of the “throwaway culture.”

And while viewers will learn that Francis is against “proselytizing,” they won’t hear his positive exhortations regarding evangelization.

The full scope of Francis’ thought has something to challenge almost everyone. The film rightly highlights themes and ideas that are stumbling blocks to some on the right — Donald Trump boosters may bristle at the Pope’s criticism of “building walls,” and Wenders himself adds a dig at “alternative facts” — but the members of U2 (who recently endorsed the move to legalize abortion in their native Ireland) could nod their heads pretty much through the whole film.

Maybe not the whole film. Rare exceptions include dismissive remarks about feminism and men’s movements as “isolated” and opposed to sexual complementarity and reciprosity. Even when Francis goes on to talk benignly about the importance of women in leadership roles, his language may sound a bit jarring to more progressive American and European ears.

Not incidentally, the film paints a similarly selective and even misleading portrait of St. Francis, along the usual lines noted by G.K. Chesterton on the first page of his excellent little sketch Saint Francis of Assisi, as a proto-archetype of “all that is most liberal and sympathetic in the modern mood; the love of nature; the love of animals; the sense of social compassion; the sense of the spiritual dangers of prosperity and even of propriety … a sort of morning star of the Renaissance.”

Such hitches and omissions notwithstanding, there’s no avoiding the power of Pope Francis’ genuineness, his expansive Christian humanism and his rapport with people of all walks of life. His celebrated turns of picturesque speech are in evidence: “spiritual Alzheimer’s disease”; “living with the accelerator down”; “globalization of indifference.”

More than once we see tears on people’s faces — and, while one might suspend judgment at the sight of a politician brushing away a tear as the Pope addresses a joint session of Congress, tears on an inmate’s tattooed face as Francis embraces and preaches to prisoners or washes and kisses their (also tattooed) feet on Holy Thursday are another matter.

The mystery of suffering and evil looms above all in a 2014 papal visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem and a 2015 multireligious gathering at Lower Manhattan’s 9/11 Memorial.

Similarly, in pastoral visits to a volunteer-run hospital in the Central African Republic, a typhoon-devastated Philippines and a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, Francis’ active solidarity with those who suffer evokes, however dimly, the Crucified Jesus to whom he pointed when asked about the problem of evil.

Some of the most memorable images emerge from these somber visits: Francis praying silently at Auschwitz or standing in a light rain wearing a translucent yellow plastic raincoat, clasping the hands of an elderly Filipino woman (also in yellow plastic) as she reverently kisses his hands.

There are also lighter moments, such as a droll Q&A with schoolchildren and a gentle papal exhortation to parents to play and waste time with their children.

The film ends with Francis citing a prayer he says he prays daily (ascribing it, following a popular misconception, to St. Thomas More) that includes a petition for a sense of humor. The last shot, of Francis grinning broadly into the camera, lingers long after the credits roll.

If Pope Francis: A Man of His Word isn’t the documentary final word on the 266th pope, in a way it’s something better: It’s a winsome, challenging call to take the Gospel more seriously and to work to make the world around us a little bit better.

He was speaking at the end of last week as 32 staff members of the SDG Centre for Africa visited Ntarama Genocide Site in Bugesera District to understand the history of Genocide against the Tutsi and how it was executed.

Ntarama has particular history of genocide since thousands were killed here as they sought refuge at the former church.

“The Genocide against the Tutsi was the worst attack on human rights, the aspect which SDGs must consider if the world is to achieve sustainable development,” he said.

“Many people read about Genocide against the Tutsi in books and other channels and it becomes difficult for them to understand. They should come and visit such memorial sites to understand first-hand,” he said.

Begashaw said that visiting memorials, remembering and supporting Genocide survivors are necessary steps to honour the innocent souls that were killed.

For Rwanda to fully recover from such situation, true love and unity must prevail, he said.

“What has been achieved in Rwanda is very impressive since many countries under similar conditions take much longer time to recover. We, however, have more things to do to ensure a better future,” he said adding SDGs promotes well-being and human rights for people.

He said that tolerance helps to manage aftermath of hard times like genocide.

“SDGs are about building people and helping them to understand what happened, fighting genocide among many other human crises. We have no room for this and should not leave behind human rights. With hardwork, we will getter a better future,” he added.

Over the next three years, the ‘Fight Inequalities’ campaign plans to integrate gender, climate and migration issues into focused campaigns on equality, sustainable farming and changing consumption and production patterns.



The campaign calls for policies and laws to make the SDGs a reality, emphasizing that “for a peaceful world, we need an equal world.” In a video, the campaign explains that inequality goes beyond wealth inequality to encompass the denial of social protections and opportunities for the most vulnerable, and to ensure equal access to health and education. The campaign calls for actions such as tackling gender inequality and discrimination, and addressing the unequal impact of climate change and environmental destruction on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.

Patrizia Heidegger, European Environmental Bureau (EEB), underscored the importance of policies and laws that aim to make societies more inclusive for everyone. She stressed, “if political leaders don’t tackle the inequalities that arise as a result of the huge environmental and social injustices facing our world then the SDGs will be meaningless.”

The campaign is part of the ‘Make Europe Sustainable for All’ project, which is funded by the European Commission’s (EC) Development education and awareness raising program that aims to promote implementation of the SDGs by and in the EU. The project brings together NGOs that work on protecting the environment, tackling climate change, defending the rights of women and young people, supporting fair trade and workers’ rights and addressing other social issues.

In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

Some of these countries presented their VNRs at previous HLPF sessions (Benin, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Switzerland, Togo and Uruguay), and are updating their progress on the SDGs.

The VNRs were called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate the sharing of national experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. The “main messages” provide a brief overview of more comprehensive review documents that are prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts during the HLPF.

By 7 June 2018, main messages were available for 35 countries, including all of the Eastern European Group (EEG) countries that will present at the 2018 HLPF. Between 8 and 18 June, 10 additional countries’ messages became available: Benin, Mali, Republic of Congo and Senegal; Bahrain, UAE and Viet Nam; Colombia and Ecuador; and Andorra.

African Group

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized. The prioritized SDGs are: SDG 2 on zero hunger, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 15 on life on land, and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

Per its summary, the Republic of Congo established a steering committee in charge of following-up on the SDGs, and is preparing an action plan for SDG implementation that should provide information on related costs for their implementation. It notes mobilizing funding for the effective and efficient operationalization of the SDGs as one of the main challenges facing the country.

Senegal’s messages note that the process of alignment between the SDGs and the ‘Plan for an Emerging Senegal’ (PES)– a policy framework to get Senegal onto the road to development in 2035 –was launched in January 2016 by the government. Its priority actions cover nearly 77% of the SDG targets. It also reports that “inclusive” mechanisms, such as an SDG monitoring platform for CSOs, were established, but that participation of some stakeholders such as the private sector, parliamentarians and local elected representatives, should be further strengthened.

Bahrain’s messages state that the Government Plan of Action (GPA) is aligned with 78% of the SDGs, and the country’s Constitution and public policies guarantee universal access to basic services, and gender equality. The country reports that basic education is free and compulsory, healthcare is free and universal, and two committees instituted by the Supreme Council for Women ensure equal opportunities and gender responsive budgeting. It also indicates that: women hold 55% of supervisory positions, with 53% and 33% participation in the public and private sectors respectively; public and civil society-led programs extend to migrant workers to safeguard their rights, provide health insurance and shelter, and combat human trafficking; five new sustainable cities are being developed; and remittances of migrant workers in Bahrain amounted to approximately US$2.5 billion in 2017.

In its messages, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announces that the SDGs and sustainability will be a central focus of Expo 2020 Dubai, and its SDG National Committee serves as a platform for multi‐stakeholder engagement. The Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, is vice-chaired by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, and comprises 17 federal government organizations, according to the VNR messages.

On progress related to SDG implementation, the UAE indicates that the SDG National Committee has: prioritized targets “to pursue on an annual basis;” determined criteria for incorporating SDG targets into the national development agenda; assessed the scope of SDG implementation “given resource capacities and constraints in a particular year;” and developed a comprehensive communication strategy to engage societal stakeholders on the SDGs. The UAE also notes that: a Private‐Sector Advisory Council reports to the vice‐chair of the SDG National Committee; it has a Minister of State for Youth Affairs; it launched the Emirates Youth Council; and seven emirate‐wide Local Youth Councils are involved in official deliberations concerning SDG implementation.

Viet Nam states that the 17 SDGs have been nationalized into 115 Vietnamese SDG targets and in its national action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It adds that sustainable development principles have been mainstreamed into its 2011-2020 Social and Economic Development Strategy and its 2016-2020 Social and Economic Development Plan. The country’s key messages note that the Viet Nam Business Council for Sustainable Development aims to enable the business community to share and spread good practices, and to play an “important role” in realizing the SDGs.

Per the messages, Viet Nam has a number of policies aimed at promoting social equality to ensure that no one is left behind, and the country has achieved a number of SDG-related results. For instance, its national multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.9% in 2015 to less than 7% in 2017; 93.4% of households in 2016 had access to safe water, and 99% of Vietnamese households had access to electricity during the same year.

Colombia’s executive summary notes that in addition to the SDG initiatives it reported on in its 2016 VNR, it has developed a national strategy (CONPES 3918) to implement the goals. The strategy, it says, includes, inter alia: a monitoring process with national indicators and quantifiable targets; institutional responsibilities; a plan for strengthening statistical capacities; and a communication strategy seeking to promote alliances with non-governmental actors.

The summary indicates that the website www.ods.gov.co comprises updated information on the country’s progress towards the goals, and that a mapping of resources from different public domestic sources and their allocation to each SDG has been prepared as a starting point for the development of a financing strategy. It also reports that a joint initiative is being developed with the private sector where companies can provide information that will enable them to make their SDG support more visible, and dialogues took place in different parts of the country to highlight SDG challenges and successful experiences.

According to its main messages, Ecuador has developed SDG “Flagship Interventions,” and has established mechanisms for the alignment, monitoring and evaluation of its planning with the 2030 Agenda. Among the SDGs to be examined in depth at the HLPF 2018, the VNR messages report that: guaranteeing universal access to water (SDG 6) is a priority for the Ecuadorian government and the “Safe Water and Sanitation for All” strategy is being implemented; and various programmes have contributed to maintain more than 16% of the national territory under conservation or environmental management (SDG 15). The messages also note that the VNR’s preparation was based on contributions from the government, private sector, academia, civil society and local governments.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Andorra reports that each “action” submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval must be associated with the SDGs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aligned its annual master plan for international cooperation with the goals. Its VNR summary notes that the Andorran private and financial sectors have integrated the 2030 Agenda into their social responsibility strategies, and education for sustainable development is a key concept of the Andorran education system, which it says, also integrates in a transversal way, education for human rights and democratic citizenship. It stresses the need to strengthen the production of statistical data, adding that the government has approved it statistical plan 2018-2021.

On SDGs examined in the VNR, Andorra says that in addition to the six goals reviewed in depth at the 2018 HLPF, it has also included Goals 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action), which are of particular importance for the country. On the VNR preparation, the Andorra’s summary states that an inter-ministerial team was set up to draft the report, national bodies representing civil society were asked to participate in the drafting process, and an emphasis was placed on the collection of statistical data. It also reports on the launch of a public consultation on the Internet and on an awareness and information campaign on the VNR.

97,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/initiatives-push-for-sustainable-fashion/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Initiatives Push for Sustainable Fashion,"5 June 2018: Sustainable development is the new black, at least at the European Development Days and for a number of campaigns and initiatives working to increase sustainable production and consumption patterns in the garment industry. Efforts are building on internationally recognized principles and guidelines, and emphasize the benefits of transparency and traceability in garment value chains.

In conjunction with the 2018 European Development Days, which convened from 5-6 June, in Brussels, Belgium, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the European Commission (EC) hosted an event on transparency and traceability in garment value chains. The event titled, ‘Do you know where your clothes come from?’ discussed opportunities for ensuring a more sustainable clothing industry.

The UNECE-ITC-EC meeting was convened as part of an initiative led by UNECE and ITC to set up a multi-stakeholder platform and develop policy recommendations and traceability standards to guide the garment industry and contribute to SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The event addressed the many challenges to traceability and transparency, discussing for instance, fragmented production processes, and the prevalence of illegitimate subcontracting and undeclared informal work in garment supply chains. Participants gave the example of the numerous, up to 15 steps, such as yarn-making, weaving, and fabric-cutting, involved in the transformation of raw materials, like wool or cotton, into a finished garment. They noted how each step has its own environmental impacts as well as labor rights issues.

A UNECE press release points out that traceability can help companies identify opportunities for efficient and sustainable resource management, health risks, environmental impacts and labor rights. This, in turn, leads to increased transparency, making it possible to obtain accurate data and disclose it to consumers and the general public. In 2017, per the UNECE, one third of the 100 largest global fashion brands had traced and made publicly available their list of tier-one suppliers.

Preceding this event, in April, the UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (CEFACT) organized an event on ‘Traceability for Sustainable Value Chains: Textile and Leather Sector.’ It highlighted the need for a harmonized set of traceability standards in garment supply chains. A 2017 CEFACT publication titled ‘Textile4SDG12‘ provides recommendations on achieving these standards. The publication “identifies basic principles, possible solutions, and provides recommendations for an international framework initiative on transparency and traceability for sustainability patterns in the clothing sector, in support of SDG 12.”

In addition to these meetings, civil society-led campaigns are working to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards openness and accountability in the fashion industry. They include #whomademyclothes by Fashion Revolution and the Transparency Pledge initiated by the Clean Clothes Campaign, Human Rights Watch and the International Labor Rights Forum. The awareness raising initiatives seek to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards more company disclosure, leading, ultimately, to a minimum, common transparency standard.

The ‘2018 Pulse of the Fashion Industry’ report published in May further explores sustainability issues in the industry. The report “aims to give guidance to companies looking to start or find further advances toward more responsible ways of doing business, by sharing proven best practices and defining bigger and bolder steps the industry must take.” Another publication, ‘A New Textiles Economy,’ was produced by a coalition of fashion stakeholders and makes the case for creating a circular fashion industry that embodies the principles of sustainable production and consumption.

Many of these ideas and pathways towards greater sustainability in fashion – as highlighted in these campaigns, reports and meetings – build on internationally recognized principles and guidelines that define sustainability requirements for the sector. These include the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector.

98,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-measuring-progress-towards-sustainable-cities-and-communities/,"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Measuring Progress towards Sustainable Cities and Communities,"This week’s brief focuses on knowledge products around SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which is one of six Goals being reviewed in depth at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

The 2030 Agenda recognizes the positive contributions of migrants. In the declaration, heads of state and government commit to “cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights” (paragraph 29), which is similar to language used in SDG target 10.7. The SDG Knowledge Hub has covered the Global Compact on Migration (GCM) process, including the most recent round of negotiations, their outcomes, additional consultations and the Secretary-General’s report, ‘Making Migration Work for All.’ This policy brief highlights research and thought pieces behind the process and issues.

At the start of the calendar year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued a publication titled, ‘World Migration Report 2018.’ The ninth of its kind, this volume “demystifies” migration, noting in its forward the heightened importance of understanding migration’s complexities in today’s “post-truth” era. Using data through June 2017, the report outlines: global migration trends; regional development; the current migration governance structure; features of current news coverage of migration; and linkages between migration, social exclusion and other hardships faced.

IOM also issued a report titled, ‘Migration in the 2030 Agenda,’ which compiles papers linking migration to thematic challenges across the SDGs. The papers suggest ways to address migration as part of efforts to implement individual Goals. As highlighted by IOM, migration is included in SDG targets 4.b, 5.2, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7, 10.c, 16.2 and 17.18.

A pilot study by IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) represents an effort to illustrate how far migrants are left behind, using harmonized census data. It discusses the potential to use such data to further monitor progress towards the SDGs, disaggregated by migratory status. SDG target 17.18 calls to increase the availability of data disaggregated by migratory status (among income, gender, age and other characteristics).

IOM GMDAC also authored a bulletin on a tool to quantify displacement and mobility. It describes IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), which aims to enable decision-making and targeted assistance in times of crisis. The DTM tracked over 30 million individuals across 72 countries in 2017, and is continuously being expanded in partnership with actors from the private sector and academia, and has fed into other reports, including the Global Report on Internal Displacement noted below. The GMDAC’s ‘Data Bulletin’ series informs the GCM process, with support from the EU.

The GMDAC previously developed Migration Governance Indicators (MGI), which have been used as a basis for assessing “well-managed migration policies,” per SDG target 10.7. The indicators help governments review the extent to which their migration policies are comprehensive, identify gaps, and advance the dialogue on migration, particularly in the context of the SDGs and the GCM. The first MGI assessment report for 15 pilot countries was released in 2016; a second report reviewing a new set of countries is forthcoming.

Also on data, the Migration Data Portal offers a tool to visualize and analyze migratory flows by country or region, as well as examine important data points on migrants’ vulnerability, well-being and remittance payments and costs. The Portal also features information on migration policy and public opinion, which can also affect other indicators such as migrants’ well-being. A summary guide is available on Data Driven Journalism. The Portal’s blog offers additional support, including a post on how to improve data on missing migrants, given the urgent need to address the more than 27,000 migrant deaths and disappearances recorded since 2014.

These efforts to collect and manage migration data are not implemented alone. The Global Migration Group (GMG) and Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) released a flagship publication in November 2017 with the IOM, World Bank Group, Governments of Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, and the broader UN system. The report is divided into four parts: concepts and criteria on migration; reasons for migration; linkages between migration and development; and protection of migrants. Titled, ‘Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ the report aims to be the go-to guide for integrating migrant priorities, policies and data into national development plans and strategies. It synthesizes best practices and lessons learned across the 16 GMG members, highlighting data needs, sources and gaps, and calling for common measures that allow comparisons migration patterns across countries and regions.

The KNOMAD partnership publishes regularly on ‘Migration and Development,’ and released its 29th brief on the subject in April 2018. This brief focuses on migration and remittances, reviewing trends in remittance and migration flows and the topic of “transit migration” where migrants temporarily stay in a country other than their intended final destination. The brief describes reasons for transit migration (both push and pull factors), regional patterns, and transit migration’s impacts on individuals, families, and the three countries involved (origin, transit and destination). The brief also notes that a significant percentage of transit migration is facilitated by smugglers. A full list of KNOMAD publications is available here.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released a report that finds over 2.5 million migrants were smuggled worldwide in 2016. Titled ‘Global Study on Smuggling of Migrants,’ the publication describes major smuggling routes around the world, and quantifies the scope of the issue, estimating that smugglers are collectively paid over US$7 billion per year. It underscores that smugglers expose migrants to risks including violence, theft, exploitation, kidnapping and death.

June 20 marked World Refugee Day. Released one day prior, the UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) ‘Global Trends’ report examines forced displacement in 2017. It finds that over 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced as of the end of 2017, 16.2 million of them being displaced that year. More than half of displaced persons are children. Of these figures, the report notes that 40 million people are internally displaced, 25.4 million are refugees who have fled their home countries to escape conflict, and 3.1 million are asylum seekers.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released a publication titled, ‘Global Report on Internal Displacement.’ The report focuses on the global displacement landscape and regional overviews, progress in reducing internal displacement, and the need for better data. It flags displacement from natural disasters as a key driver within countries, noting the issue as “both a cause and consequence of insecurity and low or unequal economic and social development.” The report sees national sovereignty as an opportunity, calling for country-led strategies to account for internal displacement risk, build governance capacity and integrate the risk into existing mechanisms. Harjeet Singh, ActionAid International, flags the report’s coverage of climate migration in an op-ed on IPS News. Separately, IOM’s Environmental Migration Portal also serves as a platform to share knowledge on the migration-environment nexus.

In its discussion on the budget for 2021-2027, the EU is proposing a near-tripling of funds for migration, asylum and border management. The Center for Global Development reviews the proposal here. Stay tuned for more on the EU budget and aid in the coming weeks.

100,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-report-2018-finds-conflict-climate-change-inequality-hindering-progress/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Report 2018 Finds Conflict, Climate Change, Inequality Hindering Progress","20 June 2018: The UN has launched the 2018 version of the yearly Sustainable Development Goals Report. It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

102,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-adopts-resolution-on-un-development-system-reform/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Adopts Resolution on UN Development System Reform,"31 May 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a resolution on the repositioning of the UN development system, in order to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By this decision, the functions of the Resident Coordinators (RCs) of the UN system in each country are separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said that, while the resolution is not seen by everyone as “the perfect document,” it represents a legitimate outcome of a multilateral process.

The consultation process on the resolution was co-facilitated by Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, and agreed on 7 May 2018 via silence procedure. The UNGA held a plenary meeting on 31 May 2018 to adopt the final draft text titled, ‘Repositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system’ (A/72/L.52).

The agreed text, inter alia: requests the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with the UN development system entities, to present an implementation plan for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system, including on the operationalization of its funding arrangements, to the UNGA before the end of the 72nd session; and endorses the transformation of the Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to assume managerial and oversight functions of the RC system under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary-General and under the ownership of the members of the ‘UN Sustainable Development Group,’ as a stand-alone coordination office within the Secretariat, reporting to the Chair of the Group (the Deputy-Secretary-General).

The funding arrangements for the new RC system are set out in a “hybrid solution” negotiated through the intergovernmental consultation process. UN Member States would provide the RC system with up to US$255 million annually, beginning in January 2019, through three sources: a 1% coordination levy on strictly earmarked, third-party, non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source; doubling the current UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Assembly following the adoption of the text. He announced that he will move immediately to put in place a transition team, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General, to implement Member States’ decisions. He noted that the reforms will enable the UN’s teams on the ground to better tailor their presence, skill sets and overall response to Member States’ priorities. In particular, the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) will better reflect country priorities and country needs, and the RCs will be impartial and empowered, with “development as their DNA.”

The Secretary-General emphasized that his preference would have been to fund the RC system through the regular UN budget, in order to ensure predictability, sustainability and ownership from all Member States. However, he noted, the hybrid funding solution put forward by the co-facilitators “is the best possible alternative.” He appealed to Member States for their immediate support so that the reforms starts to be implemented on 1 January 2019. Guterres added that the resolution represents the foundations to place sustainable development at the heart of the UN, and to advance the SDGs with poverty as the first goal.

A representative of the UN Secretariat explained that, in order to implement the provisions of the resolution, requirements amounting to approximately US$255 million would be needed on an annual basis, with the major portion of the requirements necessitating extrabudgetary resources. She expressed hope that front-loaded voluntary contributions will be received in 2018 to expedite the inception of the reinvigorated RC system as of 1 January 2019. She further added that the UN Secretariat’s share of the UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement pertaining to 2019 will be US$13-US$16 million.

In the ensuing discussion, India said the modalities for funding the proposals in the adopted text are “significantly different” than those contained in the Secretary-General’s initial funding proposals, ignoring the views and consensus of a large part of the UN membership on the need for predictable and sufficient resources for the proposed reforms. He added that the availability of resources remains unclear, and the proposed cost sharing for the RC system increases uncertainty. The US expressed the expectation that the reforms will reduce bureaucracy, improve performance, and increase flexibility for agencies to quickly respond to challenges.

The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Ethiopia for the African Group, stressed that the resolution “explicitly states” that the UNDAF should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national governments, through an open and inclusive dialogue between the host government and the UN development system, and in accordance with national development policies, tailored to priorities and the country needs. He cautioned that if the resolution is poorly implemented, the Group’s member states will bear the brunt of the costs, and this poses particular risks for the smallest and most vulnerable countries.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said the LDCs prefer no reductions in the country presence of the UN development system. The proposal of 50% common premises by 2021 should not incur any additional financial burden for LDCs, he added. He requested the UN Secretariat to ensure that the annual report on system-wide support to the UN development system provides disaggregated data and information on LDCs in every chapter, and has a separate section on LDCs highlighting the progress and challenges in these countries.

The EU noted that the agencies of the UN development system will be “in the driver’s seat.” Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), said the RC function is moving from being dependent on the infrastructure of a US$5 billion organization to that of an office that currently has a staff of 30. In this context, careful handling and maintenance of relationships is paramount, particularly during the transition period. CANZ added that the upcoming funding dialogue should be seized as an opportunity to explore how different types of partnerships can support the work of the UN development system and ensure an expanded funding base that moves beyond a small group of traditional donors.

Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) called for the reform to address multi-country offices (MCOs), and highlighted the need for dependable funding for small island states to implement it. CANZ welcomed the MCOs review.

Lajcak said the actions to be undertaken in the reforms to the UN development system cannot be considered in a vacuum, but the momentum needs to be brought forward into: the ECOSOC review and alignment process; the discussions on UN management reform and the UN’s peace and security pillar; as well as in Member States’ daily work.

The “repositioning” process began with an ECOSOC dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption, in December 2016, of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. The UN Secretary-General then delivered two mandated reports outlining proposals for reforms to the UN development system, in June and December 2017. These proposals were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings led by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, in January and February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” addressing questions raised by Member States during the briefings.

The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during ECOSOC’s Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), in February and March 2018. Petersen and Boukadoum then guided Member States in a six-week consultation process to agree on the resolution.

103,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/third-sti-forum-calls-for-national-roadmaps-technology-regulations/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Third STI Forum Calls for National Roadmaps, Technology Regulations","6 June 2018: The third annual Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs (STI Forum) focused on the Goals under review at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): SDG 6 (on water); SDG 7 (on energy); SDG 11 (on cities); SDG 12 (on consumption and production) and SDG 15 (on biodiversity).

The event took place from 5-6 June 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The STI Forum featured ten substantive panel discussions and a series of 90-second innovation pitches selected from numerous submissions related to the SDGs under discussion.

The STI Forum is a component of the UN’s Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The TFM also includes an Inter-Agency Task Team on STI for SDGs (IATT), a 10-Member Group, and an online platform.

Opening the meeting, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Marie Chatardova stressed the need for technologies to address the vulnerabilities of those most left behind. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Chef de Cabinet for the UN Secretary-General, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology and robotics, will generate new solutions to SDG implementation.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, said “STI roadmaps” serve as a practical building block for policy makers, the private sector, civil society and development partners to integrate STI into national development plans and budgets. He said the Bank will leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to: develop the foundation for sustainable, technology-led economies; expand the capacity of people and institutions to thrive in a society resilient in the face of disruption; and harness disruptive technology, data, and expertise to solve development challenges and manage risks.

Andrew Keen, author of ‘The Internet is Not the Answer’ and ‘How to Fix the Future,’ called for greater regulation of companies and data privacy, adding that the UN is the right place to begin this conversation. Miguel Ruíz Cabañas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mexico, called for the UN to collect and analyze information and develop best practices and exchange of information so governments can utilize technological change and AI while minimizing risks.

Arun Sundararajan, New York University, US, noted that it is not pragmatic to try to regulate online platforms, which will increasingly mediate people’s relationships with markets, but we need to negotiate with them as with institutions. He emphasized that we need to start a democratization of these platforms and ask them to come up with a clear, simple set of principles and take a positive role in society.

Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, addressed the environmental costs of technology. For example, the electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining equals the electricity use of the Czech Republic.

Peter Major, UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), said the CSTD focuses on the positive implications of big data to fight typhoid in Uganda and help farmers respond to food security and drought in India and other countries. He called for linking traditional knowledge with modern science, as well as examining ethical challenges and bridging the digital gap.

Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, United Arab Emirates (UAE), observed that, in order to achieve the SDGs, we will need to capture the data from ongoing experiments. Beyond big data, we will need access to data from other complex projects, she said. Thomas Philbeck, World Economic Forum, stressed that “the way we talk about technology matters” and asked for caution when using language that might lock us into dangerous narratives, such as fear or technology or “worshipping” technology.

For the SDGs to succeed in Africa, technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential.

Erika Kraemer-Mbula, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, stressed that for the SDGs to succeed, they need to succeed in Africa. She noted that Africa is estimated to double its population by 2050, and will have the world’s largest work force, comprised especially of youth. Microenterprises will thus be vital to employment, she said, and technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential for sustainable development. She called for thinking beyond education to learning systems that blend different types of science.

Suresh Nair, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India, gave an example reflecting the benefits of genetic engineering and biotechnology. To address the decrease in arable land as well as pressure to use less pesticides and the urgent need to increase food productivity, he highlighted “host-based resistance.” By using plants’ natural resistance, he said crop yield can increase, which lessens the pressure to convert forestland into farmland and prevents biodiversity loss. To that end, he recommended carrying out vigorous screening of crop germplasm to identify appropriate resistance against major pests and devise molecular tools to get a better understanding of insect pests.

During the Forum’s discussions, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) called for encouraging the development, transfer, and diffusion of technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms. He called for making the TFM online platform operational as soon as possible.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said internet access depends on a few major companies in the developed world, and LDCs lack the needed infrastructure to attract them. He stressed that access to information and communications technologies and the internet is essential to graduate from LDC status and not to relapse after graduation. He expressed hope that the Technology Bank for LDCs, inaugurated on 4 June 2018, will provide the LDCs with the support they need. Turkey noted that the Bank, which is hosted by Turkey, will strengthen the capacity of LDCs to scale up and deploy technology and innovation, and strengthen partnerships between governments, the private sector and other stakeholders.

Brazil called for addressing inequalities caused by the digital divide. Japan said that every country should develop an STI roadmap for each SDG to ensure no one is left behind.

The report titled, ‘Investing in the Green Economy: Busting Common Myths,’ aims to help investors to better understand their interactions with the green economy.

It also seeks to assist investors in developing investment strategies by measuring, in a quantifiable manner, the transition towards sustainability.

The report identifies a large investment opportunity in the green economy, backed by global efforts to combat climate change and broader environmental challenges. The green economy, according to the report, aims to achieve sustainable development without degrading the environment, and be efficient, clean, circular, collaborative and low carbon. Thus, it concludes, the green economy is critical for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The report finds that the green economy represents 6% of the global stock market, or around US$4 trillion, coming from clean energy, energy efficiency, water, waste and pollution services. It notes that it could increase to 10% of global market value by 2030, assuming approximately US$90 trillion in green investments by that time. The report also determines that, over the last five years, green companies generated higher returns than the broader stock market.

The green economy could increase to 10% of global market value by 2030, assuming approximately US$90 trillion in green investments.

According to the study, the green economy is diversified by: company size, with large companies representing two thirds of green market capitalization; sector, including industrials (the largest), followed by utilities, technology, chemicals, and construction and materials; and geography, with the US, Japan, Europe and China leading the pack. The report finds that around 3,000 globally listed companies are exposed to the green economy.

The publication analyzes a range of products and services from different sectors in renewable and alternative energy, energy efficiency, water, and waste and pollution, based on their impact on climate change mitigation and adaptation, water, resource use, pollution, and agricultural efficiency.

According to the report, the energy industry makes up more than half of the green economy, with food, agriculture, water and transport also being important. It explains that high-tech and renewables also have major roles to play, specifically through the cloud computing technology, which can help companies reduce carbon emissions by up to 90%.

The report also highlights the rapidly growing use of solar and hydroelectric power, and resources such as lithium for batteries, and organic foods or seeds that boost agricultural yields as critical to the green economy.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever.

The report provides an overview of campaigns and events that took place during 2017, with a focus on sustainable tourism and the SDGs.

The report highlights three SDG targets that mention sustainable tourism, namely: target 8.9, on devising and implementing, by 2030, policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products; target 12.b, on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and target 14.7, on increasing the economic benefits of small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

Among the numerous SDGs-related events highlighted in the publication is the 22nd UNWTO General Assembly, which convened in September 2017 in Chengdu, China. The meeting focused on tourism’s contribution to the SDGs, and adopted the Chengdu Declaration on Tourism and the SDGs. The Declaration states that tourism is vital for achieving the SDGs as it can, inter alia, stimulate economic growth, create jobs, combat poverty, enhance livelihoods, empower women and youth, and preserve terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The Declaration proposes that countries: undertake national assessments on tourism’s contribution and commitment to the SDGs; ensure tourism is included in inter-ministerial SDG commissions and/or working groups; and establish frameworks and mechanisms that enable participation of all stakeholders to enhance the contribution of tourism to national SDG strategies.

The second UNWTO/UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Tourism and Culture, which convened in December 2017 in Muscat, Oman, focused on fostering sustainable development. The conference adopted the Muscat Declaration, which calls for, inter alia: advancing the contribution of cultural tourism to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs; encouraging an innovative approach for sustainable urban development through cultural tourism; and exploring links between culture and nature in sustainable tourism.

UNWTO’s ‘Travel.Enjoy.Respect.’ campaign aims to increase awareness of the role of travelers in harnessing tourism’s contribution to sustainable development.

The sixth Global Summit on Urban Tourism, themed ‘Sustainable and Competitive Tourism on the New Urban Agenda (NUA),’ convened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in December 2017. It aimed to advance sustainable and competitive urban tourism, which contributes to the SDGs and the NUA.

A conference on ‘Tourism, a Tool for Inclusive Growth and Community Engagement in Africa,’ met in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 2017. The conference raised awareness regarding tourism’s contribution to poverty alleviation and the ways in which it can help achieve the SDGs and generate benefits for African societies. The Lusaka Declaration, inter alia, calls on African governments to develop and implement tourism policies that contribute to the SDGs; and urges donors, investors and financial institutions to increase investment in sustainable tourism development in Africa.

The Global Conference on Jobs and Inclusive Growth convened in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in November 2017 under the theme ‘Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism.’ The conference called on donors to recognize tourism impacts on sustainable development and mobilize resources for tourism development through existing financing mechanisms and new SDG-related facilities, including the UNWTO Tourism for Development Facility.

The fourth World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue gathered under the theme ‘Advancing Intercultural Dialogue: New Avenues for Human Security, Peace and Sustainable Development,’ in Baku, Azerbaijan, in May 2017. Participants discussed, inter alia, the conditions under which sustainable tourism can promote cross-cultural understanding and peace in the context of the 2030 Agenda.

The third UNWTO World Forum on Gastronomy Tourism in San Sebastián, Spain, in May 2017, concluded, inter alia, that public and private entities must work together to harness the power of gastronomy tourism to contribute to the SDGs through conserving biodiversity and empowering local communities.

In addition, the report provides an update on the UNWTO/Chimelong Programme on Wildlife and Tourism, which, among others, focuses on advancing the SDGs through sustainable tourism, particularly as it relates to wildlife conservation. It also reviews progress made on the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the ten-year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), which, inter alia, continues to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) in tourism as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), with the potential to advance other SDGs.

Furthermore, the report notes that 2017 was the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development (IY2017). As part of IY2017, the UNWTO supported a consumer-oriented campaign, ‘Travel.Enjoy.Respect,’ which will continue through 2018. Among other issues, the campaign aims to increase awareness of the role of travelers in harnessing tourism’s contribution to sustainable development. As part of the campaign, an exhibition at the UN Office in Geneva links each SDG to one of 17 stories of individuals working in tourism around the world.

UNWTO and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published a report titled, ‘Tourism and the Sustainable Development Goals – Journey to 2030,’ which aims to help the tourism sector contribute to implementation of the SDGs. The report’s findings will be included in the ‘Tourism for SDGs’ interactive web platform, a data center and educational resource to be launched in July 2018.

An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

109,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-elects-next-president-ecuadors-foreign-affairs-minister/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Elects Next President: Ecuador's Foreign Affairs Minister,"5 June 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has elected María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility of Ecuador, as President of its 73rd session (2018-2019). She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

The 2018 UNLEASH SDG Innovation Lab brought together 1,000 youth from 108 countries for an 8-day intense programme designed to accelerate innovative solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO-IOC) is the custodian agency for the indicator.

The GOA-ON, a collaborative international network of 475 members from 80 nations, is committed to increasing global ocean acidification observation capacity in support of SDG target 14.3, which calls to “minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.” SDG target indicator 14.3.1 focuses on “average marine acidity measured at an agreed suite of representative sampling stations. It is within the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

In the 14.3.1 indicator methodology, experts provide detailed guidance to scientists and countries on how to carry out measurements in line with best practices established by the ocean acidification community. The methodology outlines how to collect information that is transparent, traceable and globally comparable. According to the IOC, improved observation and research on ocean acidification is critical for supporting scientific and governmental efforts towards climate adaptation and mitigation.

The GOA-ON Executive Council also discussed efforts to increase global ocean acidification observing capacity, in line with the Council’s UN Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitment. As part of its commitment, the GOA-ON is working to build capacity in regions that have limited observation and limited ocean science capacity. The Council and its Secretariat are organizing capacity building workshops on ocean acidification monitoring and experimentation best practices and providing sensor kits to allow scientists to collect reliable data and contribute to the global ocean acidification monitoring effort.

The GOA-ON Secretariat includes the IOC of UNESCO, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, US and the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICCC) in Monaco.

CANBERRA — For much of the past year, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been carrying out a rigorous assessment into how businesses, government departments, civil society organizations, and more have been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. That voluntary national review, the nation’s first, looks at how SDGs are woven into all sectors — as well as the challenges faced in assessing them.

In the report launched in Sydney on June 15, Australia chose a case-study style of reporting with snapshots into activities across the 17 goals. The aim is to demonstrate both that the SDGs are a core part of government policy and services delivery, and that there is wide external support to help make the goals a success.

Australia’s SDG implementation strategy

The SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

According to the review, Australia’s approach to SDG implementation is to identify key areas of activity appropriate to Australia’s “national circumstances.” At the federal level, policy requirements will be determined by priorities delegated to government agencies or other levels of government.

Progressing the SDGs: What are the barriers and solutions to national implementation? At Australia's second Sustainable Development Goals Summit, held in Melbourne on March 13, participants highlighted a number of barriers to implementing the SDGs on a national scale, in a country that considers the goals more linked to the Millennium Development Goals than to domestic politics.

It is nearing three years since the SDGs were adopted in September 2015, yet the review finds that Australia is still engaging domestically to identify policies and programs that are contributing to the outcome of the goals.

During the report launch, Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop identified four goals of particular importance to Australia: Gender equality; inclusive and sustainable economic growth; ocean conservation; and peace and governance — goals 5, 8, 14, and 16 respectively.

“There is a very strong alignment between the SDGs and Australia,” Bishop said. “What is important, though, is that we all work in partnership, government, business, civil society, private sector, the public sector. This is an effort for us all.”

Three hundred and twelve government and nongovernment agencies were consulted for the review. Key stakeholders engaged to provide feedback for the VNR included the Australian Council for International Development, Global Compact Network Australia, United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, U.N. Association of Australia, People with Disability Australia, National Congress of Australia’s First People and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Nongovernment sectors including universities, businesses, and civil society are expected to contribute to the goals in building public awareness, as well as progressing the implementation of the SDGs “beyond ‘business as usual’ to make a real impact.”

Australia’s strengths, the report suggests, lie in innovation, technical capability, and its willingness to share knowledge with the world. Building upon this, DFAT hopes they can reduce inequality within Australia and globally.

Investigating interlinkages

Due to the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, it is important to look at how the goals connect and where associations can be made for greater impact. Through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s work, Australia is applying this approach in their SDG implementation.

“CSIRO’s work has shown that taking such an approach, identifying both positive and negative interactions, could help us achieve global outcomes at a significantly lower cost through thoughtful coordination of otherwise fragmented action,” the report reads. “Likewise, identifying trade-offs ahead of time could enable conflicts among objectives to be managed before they become institutionalised.”

Through this work, Australia is hoping to demonstrate that the SDGs can act as a “tool” for organizations to identify and mitigate risk and opportunities outside of their core business or functions. This will allow the SDGs to move from government-supported action to whole-of-Australia supported action.

Equally, by encouraging collaboration between organizations, Australia hopes to create stronger interlinkages between the goals.

“For example, the South Australian Government’s Health in All Policies initiative takes a ‘joined-up’ policy development approach to achieve better public policy outcomes and simultaneously improve population health and wellbeing,” the report says. “Such an approach is based on the understanding that health is not just the product of health care activities, but is influenced by a wide range of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants of health.”

What about data?

SDGs show slow progress, not on track to reach 2030 targets, UN reports Conflict and climate change drove at some of the most significant setbacks documented in the 2018 SDGs report, such as a rise in global hunger rates.

Clearly missing from the report is data demonstrating where Australia lies in relation to progress against each goal, with targets that would determine what demonstrates success domestically as well as through its foreign aid program. But the report does lay out Australia’s data strategy for the SDGs.

According to the report, Australia will need “relevant, quality and timely statistics” that provide evidence for national decision-making and policy.

“We have made concerted efforts to identify relevant, pre-existing data sets that match or closely align to the SDG Indicators,” the report says. “In line with the UN Statistical Commission guidance, Australia has approached the issue of data analysis, identification and reporting from the perspective that countries will approach the indicator framework in line with their own national priorities and capabilities.”

In identifying relevant indicators for the SDG, the Australian Bureau of Statistics undertook a data mapping exercise to identify government-held data sources that could be used as an SDG indicator. But this is not a straightforward process.

“Like other countries, Australia has challenges in identifying datasets,” the report says.

Identifying data custodians and developing a single point of truth where there are multiple custodians are important. Australia is still trying to determine data collection and analysis methodology for a number of SDG indicators that have no current accepted methodology for collection.

Domestically, Australia is working to develop an SDG data platform to make relevant government datasets on SDG indicators available and will indicate the status of Australian data collection against all 232 SDG indicators — a portal expected to be updated based on available data and information, and not a static snapshot from a point in time.

Across time, it is expected this platform will help to identify progress, becoming an SDG reporting platform to support future VNRs.

Australia’s data strategy also takes into account support for neighboring countries through the foreign aid program to enhance their ability to collect, interpret, and analyze data that will help them in determining in-country needs and progress.

Case studies to illustrate Australia’s implementation approach

For many of the case studies used in the report, SDG linkage occurs as an afterthought.

To highlight Australia’s work to support goal 15 on forest management, the report uses the Australian Business and Biodiversity Initiative, an cross-sectoral alliance of organizations promoting the mainstreaming of biodiversity into business practices and decision-making.

But the initiative was established in 2014, before the adoption of the SDGs, and therefore the linkage to the goals tenuous.

Yet the format does help to demonstrate how the SDGs are at the core of “business-as-usual” operations in Australia, as well as the diverse role individuals and organizations outside government can play in their implementation.

Highlighting the work of Plan Australia in developing Free to Be, an interactive online map to help girls and women identify safe spaces in large cities, shows that addressing social challenges is important to Australia — and encouraging these ideas and initiatives will lead to greater change that can be seen by 2030.

The response

On the whole, the VNR has been largely applauded by Australia’s NGOs, that see it as a milestone in SDG implementation. But they also see the challenges it poses — both in Australia’s policy and reporting style.

For ACFID Chief Executive Officer Marc Purcell, the report highlights the challenges Australia faces in addressing health, economic, and social issues faced by Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The environmental challenges are also great, with the Great Barrier Reef under threat from climate change and policies enabling maritime pollution. And poverty continues to grow.

Still according to Purcell, the nature of the case study report showed the value of early adopters’ work, but also showed that examples were “few and far between.”

“To have any realistic chance of achieving the goals by 2030, Australia needs to rapidly transform the way it’s working and put sustainability at its heart,” he said. “We should not be imposing the burden of our failure to act on the next generation. The time for talking has passed, now is the time for action on the SDGs.”

Australia’s VNR will officially be presented to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development at the U.N. in New York, on July 17, by Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific.","Australia’s SDG implementation strategyThe SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

Photo by: Kelli Rogers / Devex

SINGAPORE — It’s day two of the annual Sustainable Development Goals innovation lab UNLEASH, and the six innovators from across the globe making up team “Shanka” seem confident with the progress they’ve made on how to boost social and emotional learning for children. But by early next morning, the bravado has seeped out and tired eyes look up from a table littered with hastily scribbled ideas. Just days away from pitching their final idea to a panel of experts, they have more questions than answers.

“We talked until late last night. We’re still in problem framing,” says team member Najmuzzaman Mohammad, chief product officer for a Bangalore-based network of impact funds.

Mohammad is one of 1,000 young people from 109 countries who participated in the annual innovation lab that began May 31. The carefully selected millennial thought leaders gathered in classrooms and halls at various university campuses across Singapore, aiming to address some of the biggest global problems. In just five days, 170 teams of former strangers worked to define their own unique problem related to the SDGs — and come up with a viable solution.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively.” — Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group

Working under a time crunch and governed by a precise methodology, participants in self-directed groups presented their progress to facilitators to pass through “gates” to the next stage of innovation. It’s a unique model, not only because it brings young talents together from around the world, but also because the ultimate goal is not necessarily the ideas or products pitched on the final day of the event.

Moving forward, participants will have access to an online platform to stay connected with each other, as well as with the expertise and financial muscle of corporations, think tanks, foundations, nonprofits, and angel investors. UNLEASH partner Deloitte has also promised seed funding and pro bono services to three to five of the solutions developed in Singapore. But the lab is less about the pitch, and more about investing in a movement — one that will generate 13,000 UNLEASH innovators by the time the lab finishes its final year in 2030.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively,” said Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group, who helped develop the UNLEASH idea and garnered support from about 250 partner organizations to make it happen.

The process

On Sunday, the “Water Lead” team — a group of five women scientists and engineers from four continents — is back at square one after spending eight hours “thinking too big,” explained Jen Loudon, a wastewater laboratory technician from the United States.

“We took three steps back … but we’re about to take five forward,” her Australian teammate Lisa Walpole told Devex.

To create an environment for innovation and spur creativity in just one week, the event in Singapore was highly curated. In fact, “a lot of this is actually down to minute plans,” Skovby said of the structured schedule that details activities from the moment talents arrive until their departure.

As a result, “there's very limited chance of this not succeeding,” he said in terms of participants having a positive experience and walking away with an understanding of the innovation methodology. “If there is something that doesn't work on the logistical side for you, it takes away focus. So everything we can do, we do.”

To start, UNLEASH flies 1,000 talents — chosen from a competitive pool of 7,500 applicants — from all over the world to a new city every year and puts them up for a week. The event costs about $4 million, without factoring in in-kind contributions. Covering all costs ensures the diversity in income and education level of its participants, which the lab considers its most fundamental aspect and biggest draw.

The innovation process is broken up into five stages, managed by facilitators from partners such as Dalberg, Deloitte, the United Nations Development Programme and expert consultants in this year’s eight focus areas: Zero hunger, education, health, water, energy, cities and communities, responsible supply chains, and climate action. A thick deck of activity cards prompts participants through problem framing, ideation, prototyping, testing, and implementing.

Every day, the teams must present their progress to a lead facilitator in order to move to the next stage of innovation. It isn’t easy, and many of the teams at UNLEASH will revisit problem framing multiple times throughout the process — while some might not graduate to ideation at all. The Water Lead team tried and failed to pass their gate on day three, but the exercise and ensuing conversation with facilitators prompted them to think differently about the issue they’d chosen to tackle: Lead-contaminated water and ensuing health concerns due to unregulated mining in Nigeria.

“I hate exercises in futility, but I think actually without going through everything we went through yesterday, we wouldn’t be able to narrow it down to what could work versus what just isn’t feasible at all,” Loudon said.

Nigerian teammate Adesinerola Adio-Adepoju, who brought the problem of lead contamination in her country to the table, described the process as a roller coaster, and a lesson in patience: “It’s almost like UNLEASH did this intentionally,” she told Devex. “They want you to get to that point where you boil over, just so you get all the bad energy out of your system so you come back to cool. We boiled over last night, and now we are cooling off, it’s good.”

The personal

On day five, Team Shanka’s Mohammad is tired, but optimistic. The group set the activity cards aside, he said, and spent a night sharing experiences from their own childhoods to spark ideas about what it takes to teach empathy and compassion at a young age.

“We actually developed a passion for it after we shared a story and realized, ‘this is something that we really need to work on because this has affected each of us.’”

Working with a team of six people sharing insights from six different countries is challenging, but it also provides more confidence that they’ve identified a strong problem to solve, he added.

Every year will see changes to the UNLEASH model as the secretariat responds to participant feedback. This year included a bigger focus on personality and team building, explained Murrayl Berner, UNLEASH 2018 innovation lab lead.

“This is an incredibly passionate set of individuals, and they're amazing and wonderful and talented in their own right — and they're also human,” Berner said. “So, you show up at something like this, you're incredibly jet lagged, you're out of your element.”

On day one, talents were prompted to identify whether they were a “thinker,” “sayer,” “doer,” or “feeler,” as well as to write down their motivating reason for participating. Equipped with this insight, along with talents’ professional backgrounds, facilitators then created diverse groups within each SDG topic area. It has become UNLEASH tradition that the ideation of team names and team charters happens long before any SDG solutions.

This year also gave the talents a chance to escape their own thematic area and chat about each other’s solutions in an idea marketplace in downtown Singapore: “Again, it's not about one team, it's about everybody, about the process and the connections and the learning,” Berner said.

Team Shanka’s socioemotional learning app for parents didn’t win them a chance to pitch in the finals, although it will be featured in the UNLEASH Solutions Catalogue, along with all the of the ideas that came out of the lab this year.

Mohammad sees room for improvement in the innovation methodology, which he felt was too broad, with activity cards prompting far more than can be accomplished in five days. He suggested UNLEASH bring in more veteran entrepreneurs to weigh in on the process design. And according to Skovby, it sounds like that will be part of UNLEASH’s future. Already, several talents who participated in Denmark flew to Singapore to act as facilitators, and 2019 will see the addition of an advanced track for entrepreneurs who have already developed a product that needs acceleration.

“It will be for you guys,” Skovby told the audience of talents at the final pitch competition, where eight teams — ranging from a social media-based sex education program to a system of nets that can help reduce farmers’ food waste — walked away with the title of top innovation of the week. “For people who have done good stuff throughout the year, we will invite again to come to UNLEASH.”

On Tuesday’s pitch day, the Water Lead team shared their solution of a simple, low-cost water treatment system for removal of heavy metals in rural Nigeria’s water supply. They didn’t advance to the final “Dragon’s Den” pitch competition, where the top spot for water went to a team that designed a safe latrine solution for a slum in South Africa.

Still, Adio-Adepoju got what she wanted out of the week, she told Devex: “I didn’t come here with a solution, I came here with a problem. I don’t have all the answers, but with young professionals in these many different fields, chances are you will talk to somebody who can provide feedback or a different insight. I feel like this is my United Nations.”

P. Nadda on Monday said India will achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target in maternal mortality by 2022 while the government's Ayushman Bharat, popularly known as Modicare, is aimed at changing the face of the country.

""India has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 139 per lakh (100,000) live births by achieving 130 by 2015. At this rate, we shall achieve SDG target of 70 by 2022, ahead of target timeline of 2030,"" Nadda said as he highlighted the achievements of his ministry in the last four years.

He said annual maternal deaths have fallen from 44,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2015, a reduction of 12,000, which is saving of 30 mothers per day. The country reduced its MMR by 37 points from 167 in 2011-2013 to 130 in 2014-16 due to strategic changes including focus on life cycle approach and multi-sectoral approach, he said.

Nadda said India's vision of universal health coverage is based on assured range of comprehensive primary care, linked to robust secondary and tertiary care being translated through Ayushman Bharat.

""Modicare is the world's largest healthcare programme. Its objective is not political. It is for changing the face of the country. Obamacare may be something else but Modicare is about the need to change the face of the country. We will solve all problems that will come our way,"" he said.

Ayushman Bharat programme has two components -- the PMRSSM promising medical cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for 10 crore poor and vulnerable families, which is about 50 crore individuals or 40 per cent of the country's population. The second component, Prime Minister Health and Wellness Centres (PMHWC), aims to convert 1.5 lakh primary health centres and sub-centres to Health and Wellness Centres.

""This will change the healthcare landscape in the country. We are moving as per the set timelines for implementing Ayushman Bharat. We shall be signing MoUs with 14 states on June 14. Under PMHWC, approval for transformation has been given to 19,000 this year.

""By second-third week of July, we will be ready with the IT platform. Identification of beneficiaries in rural areas is done 80 per cent. We want to provide a glitch-free system from the start. So, once the IT testing is done, the Prime Minister will launch the programme,"" he said.

Nadda further said that the government has given total flexibility to the states to choose their health system and how it suits them the best and further government is ready to provide the financial support also.

""Under free Drugs and Diagnostics Service Initiative medicine worth Rs 14,000 crore have been disbursed in last two and a half years. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis program, more than 2.38 lakh patients have been benefited. Amrit outlets provide drugs for cancer and cardiovascular diseases at 60-90 per cent discount. These outlets have helped patients save Rs 346.59 crore so far,"" he said.

Further, the minister said work has begun on the new AIIMS at Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Nagpur, Kalyani (West Bengal), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Bathinda (Punjab), Guwahati and Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh).

The focus was on inequality, for example in income, social mobility and access to education and health care. Data camp participants were challenged to design visualisations to make the progress on the SDGs more tangible.

SDGs

The venue of the data camp – which took place from 28 May to 1 June - was UT’s DesignLab. It was the third data camp organised jointly by UT and the CBS, but it was the first time that DesignLab was approached to co-organise and host the event. The pioneering character of this innovation platform within UT turned out to be a hothouse for novel data insights. In previous data camps, researchers from the CBS and universities tackled research questions with the aid of big data. ‘This time we used a different approach,’ explained Jacobiene van der Hoeven of the CBS’ expertise centre on collaboration with universities (ECHO). ‘The focus was on data visualisation and the United Nations’ SDGs. The challenges and data came not only from the CBS and UT, but also for example from Overijssel province, Curacao’s central bureau of statistics and a research institute from Costa Rica. The innovative initiatives of UT, such as DesignLab, is one of the reasons we value our strategic partnership with this university so highly.’

Practical applications

The United Nations adopted the seventeen SDGs in 2015 and they have to be achieved by 2030. The CBS monitors Dutch progress on the goals using a wide range of indicators. The second CBS report on the SDGs in the Netherlands was published in March this year and received extensive attention from other government organisations and the media. Van der Hoeven: ‘The theme is very important for the Netherlands. During the data camp multidisciplinary teams of researchers, PhD students, professionals and experts combined their knowledge and skills to approach the data from different perspectives. They showed us how visualisations can make complex sustainability phenomena easier to understand.’ One of the challenges came from the CBS: it asked participants to map differences in well-being in Europe. It also sent along experts in the area of methodology and geographic information systems (GIS) to support the participants. ‘It is great to see what a small group of passionate people with a wide range of skills and cultural knowledge can achieve in such inspiring surroundings. We discovered new possibilities for visualisation methods and cross-links which we shall investigate further for new joint projects. And we were able to expand our network.’

Collaboration and creativity

The UN SDGs are also important for the UT. Frank Kresin, DesignLab’s director: ‘They are an important framework for sustainable development to which we are fully committed. DesignLab has relations with many very intelligent students and researchers. Together we have a lot to contribute.’ DesignLab is a platform at UT for multidisciplinary collaboration and creativity focusing on design education and research in the area of design. ‘It is the perfect venue for a data camp’, says Kresin. ‘Two thousand square metres in which students and scientists – assisted by our Dream Team and the DesignLab Research Fellows - work together with businesses and social organisations. In this way we can connect scientific knowledge with community issues and challenges. This results in innovative solutions and products which are always based on concrete needs of partners from society.’ Looking back at the previous five days, Kresin too is extremely pleased with the results. ‘It has been a very valuable week for the participants; they have gained practical experience, learnt new methods and approaches and got lots of new ideas. The results show that new sustainable solutions are possible! In addition, the data camp has further reinforced our partnership with the CBS and other experts.’



Data visualisation delivers new insights

Curacao’s central bureau of statistics was another enthusiastic participant in the SDG DataViz Camp. Leander Kuijvenhoven: ‘The theme of this data camp immediately appealed to us. The SDGs are important for our work and visualising the data was an innovative way to address them. The data from our 2015 social cohesion survey were a good starting point to examine inequality against the background of the SDGs. The participants’ fresh approach to the data resulted in new insights, and resulted in a number of concrete ideas for an interactive tool to explore the SDGs from a visual perspective.’

It's also a decent weight, an attractive as well as functional design, well constructed and reasonably priced to boot(y).

Pros: Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made

Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made Cons: The minimal padding might feel a bit too firm for some

The cutout isn't overly large compared to my previous saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow (which Lara tested in 2015), but it is well positioned and I found it does a great job of relieving pressure – absolutely crucial to a saddle's comfort. The Allure tips the scales at a respectable 268g (claimed 260g), just a shade more than the Diva.

> Find your nearest dealer here

SDG says this female-specific saddle is designed for all riding disciplines, and I found it performs well both on and off road. It is relatively narrow, at 143mm, and is only available in this one width; this, combined with the cutaway side profile, allows unrestricted leg movement, aiding pedalling efficiency. I actually prefer this narrowness to the 152mm-wide Diva.

It is quite long too, at 265mm, with a slim down-curved nose. This gives you plenty of room to shift your weight forward for climbing, while the seat's flat shape makes it easy to move around.

Construction

The low-profile Allure is made from high-quality materials and is well put together. It sports a lightweight nylon fibre base and LPU foam padding – although some might find the padding a bit too minimal. Compared to the more generously upholstered Diva Gel Flow, it has a very firm feel and it did take me a few rides for my behind to adapt to it. The Allure's wings are not as flexible as the Diva's either, although this didn't pose any problem, particularly because of its narrower width. Having spent several long days in the saddle, I can vouch for its comfort.

The Allure comes in two models: with titanium-alloy rails, tested here, or chromoly rails. The Ti-alloy version, as well as saving weight, is a little more forgiving because the titanium offers slightly more flex than chromoly, and helps absorb road vibrations. You pay for the privilege, though, as the chromoly model retails around £20 less, but then it weighs about 50g more.

Price-wise it compares well with others we've tested on road.cc. A lighter but similar sounding firm-rather-than-armchair option that Sarah got on well with is Fizik's Luce S-Alloy, at 250g and £86.99, and Tass liked the Specialized Ruby Expert, rrp £115 and weight 256g. But you can pay less: I really liked the £49.99 Fabric Scoop Gel saddle; no cutout but lots of comfort and not that much heavier at 273g.

> Buyer's Guide: 9 of the best women's saddles

Ultimately, I found the Allure very comfortable, and I'm impressed by its durability – the synthetic cover hasn't scuffed in a few months of riding, and it's easy to wipe clean. I also like that it doesn't look 'girly' and it comes in a veritable rainbow of colours so you can coordinate it with your bike.

Verdict

A firmer feel than some, but ultimately comfortable for long day rides and for off-road use too

118,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’,"The ‘fivequel’ (or a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) has nothing to say and no case for its own existence.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom runs two hours and 10 minutes, and if you bracket the first five minutes and the last five minutes, any random five minutes in the remaining two hours are probably more enjoyable than any random five minutes of the previous Jurassic World movie, and probably any five minutes of Jurassic Park 3.

There are images worth looking at, for one thing. Visually, not much from Colin Trevorrow’s 2015 Jurassic World has stuck with me beyond Chris Pratt holding three velociraptors at bay with hand signals and steady nerves (and later absurdly cruising alongside the raptor pack on a motorcycle).

J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage; The Impossible) has a better eye and a gift for atmosphere and creates painterly, sometimes powerful images. He also displays a Spielbergian gift for pushing the audience’s buttons. I jumped and laughed repeatedly, sometimes in the same five minutes.

As the five-minute stretches pile up, though, the movie goes back to the same tricks too often. The “bigger fish” trope is used at least twice too often, and the kitchen cabinet door from the first film becomes a dumbwaiter door here that is used repeatedly.

Eventually, all those five-minute stretches add up to two hours and 10 minutes that have to tell some kind of story that ought to be about something. Fallen Kingdom is a “fivequel” (or, if you prefer, a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) with nothing to say and no case for its own existence beyond brand momentum and the employability and photogenic looks of Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.

If Fallen Kingdom did have something to say, it might be about environmentalism and exploitation of nature. After the disastrous collapse of the new Jurassic World theme park (and hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements), the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar are on their own — and facing extinction from the island’s volcanic activity (a plot point going back to the original Michael Crichton novel, so we can’t ding the filmmakers for it).

This makes the dinosaurs objects of considerable preservationist concern and action. Howard’s character, Claire Dearing, now a crusading conservationist, might as well be a different character from the buttoned-up sexist stereotype of the first film (she’s closer in spirit to her park ranger in Pete’s Dragon).

Claire and Pratt’s one-time raptor trainer Owen Grady are no longer an item, but she manages to persuade him to join her on a rescue mission to Isla Nublar, accompanied by an anxious tech wizard (Justice Smith) and an ex-Marine paleoveterinarian (Daniella Pineda). To be clear, the mission is to rescue dinosaurs — a mission that occasions some debate, as well it might.

Unlike other endangered species, dinosaurs play no integral role in the balance of an ecosystem, nor are they valued by preservationists for their biodiversity (only the villains talk about the dinosaurs as resources). Instead, Claire’s brief for the dinos rests on human appreciation and empathy: We like seeing dinosaurs and they are living, breathing creatures that deserve our respect and compassion.

Neither consideration is without merit, though the waters are muddied by talk of “dinosaur rights.” (In Catholic moral thought, human beings have moral obligations regarding animals and owe them kindness, but animals lack by nature the capacity for moral agency and responsibility and thus are not properly subjects of “rights.”)

Backing for the mission comes from Sir Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell, affecting a British accent and an unwonted joviality), an old business partner of (and stand-in for) the late Richard Attenborough’s John Hammond. Cromwell’s household includes his unscrupulous right-hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), his stern housekeeper Iris (Geraldine Chaplin) and his young granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon), on hand to be this movie’s spunky menaced child.

Where the last film’s ruthless paramilitary figure was played by Vincent D’Onofrio in low-rent Brian Dennehy mode, this time we’ve got Ted Levine in low-rent Woody Harrelson mode. (Both D’Onofrio and Levine have much more interesting modes, so the slight is to the film, not the players.)

None of these characters is more than one-dimensional. Claire and Owen were one-dimensional characters in the first film, but now that Claire’s not an ice queen and Owen is at least less of a sexist jerk, I’m not sure they have even one dimension.

Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm is on hand, barely, to testify about the inevitable consequences of human irresponsibility. This sets up a contradiction at the heart of the drama that the filmmakers have no idea how to solve.

The dinosaurs can’t be contained on Isla Nublar or anywhere else. Not only does life always find a way, unscrupulous human efforts to exploit the dinosaurs will always offer the dinos opportunities to break free. Realistically, dinos are an unpredictable hazard not only to human beings but to whole ecosystems.

Yet our heroes love the dinos and want them to live — and the longer the franchise wears on, the more the movies love the dinos too, even if the “oo” and “ah” always gives way to running and screaming.

Of course even reconstituted dinosaurs ought to be treated humanely. At the end of the day, though, if it’s them or us, there’s only one right answer, and the movie seems to struggle with that. One line even seems to suggest that what dinosaurs really need is for humans to get out of the way.

Perhaps I’m thinking about this too hard, or perhaps the writers should have thought harder. Certainly the plot is one utterly predictable development after another (most of which my 15-year-old daughter actually predicted as the movie unfolded).

The last movie featured a genetically engineered hybrid supersaurus called Indominus Rex, a powerful, intelligent amalgam of T-rex and other species, most ominously including velociraptor. It was supposed to be ominous, anyway; I found it a lame reveal, since I had assumed that of course raptor DNA was in the mix and wondered whether the intelligence might reflect a more transgressive choice to mix in mammalian DNA, possibly even human.

Now they’ve got an even smarter, more advanced designer dino called an “Indoraptor,” a hybrid based on Indominus Rex, but with, you know, more raptor. What’s next, “Velocindoraptor”? Apparently velociraptor is the cowbell of dino design and the filmmakers are Christopher Walken. How is the imaginative scope so limited?

What makes this even weirder is that the Fallen Kingdom throws in some unrelated transgressive science involving human DNA, seemingly at random and with no connection to the main dinosaur theme. This goes nowhere and does nothing, at least in this movie. (Spoiler alert: The science in question involves human cloning.)

The first five minutes are soured for me by a particularly cruel killing of a random character overtly recalling a far crueler killing in the previous Jurassic World. (I assume this is cowriter Colin Trevorrow tipping his hat to himself.)

The last five minutes crash and burn completely as the heroes struggle with doing something unthinkable before taking a head-smacking cop-out to get the ending the movie wants, which is not actually the ending this movie wants, but the ending the next movie wants.

This is, more and more, the new normal in the evolution (or re-engineering) of Hollywood blockbusters. As audience expectations adapt, third acts and resolutions are becoming optional. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is what a movie looks like when the goal is less to send viewers home satisfied than to send them home anticipating the next movie, which is not the same thing.

Representatives from several agencies on the table as well as key community partners were in attendance.

“We’re very happy with what was accomplished in the past year,” says Inspector Shawna Spowart at the Cornwall Community Police Service. “The Situation Table provides wrap-around support for those who are experiencing extremely stressful and risky periods in their lives.”

From its launch in May 2017 until early May 2018, the work accomplished by the Situation Table has helped 30 local individuals and 11 families.

The CSDG Situation Table is composed of 26 frontline, acute care and social service agencies that work collaboratively to help ensure the safety of individuals, families and groups of people who are at high risk of suffering from violent acts.

When a case is referred to the Situation Table, the various partners in the project, which include school boards, the police, the Children’s Aid Society, the Cornwall Community Hospital and the Canadian Mental Health Association, meet and work together to reduce the imminent risk of harm, usually within 24 to 48 hours. The Situation Table remains involved in the case until the level of risk has been reduced.

“An early collaborative intervention from the Situation Table has proven it helps prevent crimes and improve the safety and well-being of the community and local residents,” explains Elyse Lauzon-Alguire, Situation Table Chair and Interim Coordinator. “Rapid mobilization Tables such as the CSDG Situation Table make police services part of a stronger safety net, rather than being the entire net themselves.”

Most situations that come to the Table concern a single individual, a family, or a group of people that are affected by multiple risk factors, including mental health issues, domestic conflict, addictions and homelessness. The CSDG Situation Table works to mitigate the risks rather than wait for a harmful incident that would require an emergency response, all while protecting the privacy of the people being assisted.

120,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/where-are-we-in-achieving-sdg-15/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?,"Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.

The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SOFO 2018 analyzes the importance of forests and trees in conserving biodiversity (SDG 15), tackling climate change (SDG 13), improving urban habitats (SDG 11), providing safe drinking water (SDG 6), supporting food security (SDG 2), reducing inequalities (SDG 10) and ending poverty (SDG 1), among other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva explained that SOFO 2018 provides “greater evidence on how forests are critical to livelihoods of the world’s poorest,” including a better understanding of the trade-offs and “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SDG 15 (life on land) includes several indicators that focus on forests. The report finds positive change globally on three indicators: proportion of forest area located in legally established protected areas; proportion of forest area under long-term forest management plans; and forest area under independently verified forest management certification schemes. The report shows no/small change globally on two indicators: forest area net change rate; and aboveground stock in forest. The report illustrates regional variation in all five indicators, with Eastern and Western Asia and Australia and New Zealand showing positive progress across all five SDG indicators.

The report further underscores the significant income generated from non-wood forest products (NWFPs), stressing that the real figure is likely much higher than global estimates of US$88 billion. For example, one in five people globally depend on NWFPs for food, nutritional diversity and income. In Europe, one in four people collects food, such as fruit and berries, directly from forests. In Uganda, the non-cash value of forest products is up to two to four times higher for local people than the cash value.

On the governance of forests, the report further documents the importance of clear legal frameworks on forest tenure rights, and commends growing trends in local governance, with national governments devolving forestry rights to local and community-based tenure. SOFO 2018 underscores the importance of strengthened legal frameworks in securing the rights of local communities and smallholders to access forests and trees, contributing to ending poverty and achieving sustainability.

SOFO 2018 highlights several positive trends, such as increasing awareness on forest preservation and increasing sustainable forest practices. For example, 56% of paper is recycled today, compared to less than 25% in 1970. The report also showcases a global increase in forest areas managed for soil and water conservation over the past 25 years. Populations in Vienna, Austria; Bogota, Columbia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Tokyo, Japan rely on protected forests for drinking water, and in the US, 180 million people rely on forests for their drinking water.

The report will be presented and discussed at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which is taking place in New York, US, from 9-18 July 2018. SDG 15 is one of the goals to be discussed during the HLPF’s “in-depth review.” [FAO Press Release] [UN Press Release] [Publication: 2018 The State of the World’s Forests]","The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

On the first day, governments began an “in-depth review” of selected SDGs, with a session on global progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Delegates heard that “the world is not on track” to meet the SDG 6 targets by 2030, in view of increasing freshwater pollution, water stress, and a declining share of official development assistance (ODA) for water-related activities.



The review of SDG 6 featured several high-level speakers, including Danilo Turk, Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace and former President of Slovenia, and Leo Heller, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation. The review of SDG 6 was aided by the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report,’ which was prepared under UN-Water coordination and presented by Stefan Uhlenbrook, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The discussion was moderated by Joakim Harlin, UN-Water.

Delegates discussed their national efforts to achieve SDG 6 and highlighted the need for good governance and partnerships. Several speakers underscored the links between water, peace and security, and Turk proposed holding an international conference on water management to discuss infrastructure and financing. Many speakers lamented the fact that the HLPF would only devote three hours to a review of SDG 6 during its four-year cycle.

IWMI said cities can be water producers, not only water consumers.

Non-governmental speakers also presented their perspectives on SDG 6. Claudia Sadoff, International Water Management Institute (IWMI), stated that cities can be water producers, not only water consumers. The Major Group for Workers and Trade Unions cautioned against privatization, and called for water utilities to be “re-municipalized” to improve equity in service delivery. Other speakers noted the need to promote efficiency of water use in the agriculture and energy sectors.

Among other issues discussed during the opening day of the 2018 HLPF was the US$200 billion shortfall in SDG financing. Keynote speaker Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University, proposed ways to cover this shortfall, including by closing tax havens, taxing the five big technology companies, and establishing a global carbon tax.

In addition, the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) anticipated the launch of a financing framework for SDG data, in October 2018. Also on the use of data for monitoring progress, participants raised the need for disaggregated data to reveal inequalities and lack of inclusion, for example, of people with disabilities.

The report covers developments from 2015-2017 on migration and sustainable development in the region, and identifies SDG targets that are directly and indirectly related to human mobility. Titled ‘Situation Report on International Migration: Migration in the Arab Region and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ the report is published in the lead-up to the anticipated adoption of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018.

The three-part report addresses: trends in international migration in the Arab region; changes in migration governance in 2016 and 2017; and linkages between international migration and the SDGs.

Approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region.

The report finds that approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region, and numbers of women migrants have increased, due to recent conflicts and violence. Various sub-regions have different migration patterns, with the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) hosting a larger concentration of migrants than anywhere else in the world, and the Mashreq region serving as a source of labor migration and displacement due to conflict.

In terms of migration governance, Arab countries maintain restrictive and gender-based policies on access to nationality. However, the report notes some improvements in upholding the rights of migrant workers and in combating human trafficking.

The authors identify four types of relationships between migration and the SDGs: the level of development in an area as a driver for mobility; migration as an opportunity for development; migrants as contributors to development in their countries of origin and also in their countries of destination; and mobile populations as vulnerable populations whose specific needs should be considered.

They highlight SDG target 10.7 on facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, as well as other relevant targets: protecting migrant workers’ labor rights and providing a safe and secure working environment, especially for women (SDG 8.8); reducing the transaction costs of remittances (SDG 10.c); expanding scholarships for students from developing countries (SDG 4.b); eliminating trafficking in persons, especially of women and girls, and forced labor and exploitation (SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2); and ensuring meaningful data collection (SDG 17.18).

The report refers to several international frameworks that can help governments assess their own policies: the Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration; the Migration Governance Framework; the Migration Governance Index; and a dashboard of indicators of measuring policy and institutional coherence for migration and development.

The Congress showcased new and emerging technologies for processing and using bamboo fiber and composite materials, highlighting its potential as a renewable natural resource.

Congress speakers and participants emphasized ways that bamboo and rattan can contribute to the SDGs on: no poverty (SDG 1); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); life on land (SDG 15); and partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): with reference to activities in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.

BARC 2018 took place from 25-27 June, on the theme of ‘Enhancing South-South Cooperation for Green Development through Bamboo and Rattan’s Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The Congress, organized by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NGFA), welcomed approximately 1,200 participants, including 500 visitors from 68 other countries. A ministerial summit and three high-level dialogues took place, in addition to 80 parallel sessions.

On SDG 1, speakers drew attention to projects that have promoted women’s entrepreneurship and empowerment through developing and promoting bamboo and rattan-based products. Terry Sunderland, University of British Columbia (UBC), called for a holistic approach and cautioned that calls for increased cultivation of bamboo should take into account land tenure and the role of women in economic activities, to ensure that rural communities truly benefit.

On SDG 7, participants discussed ways to expand the manufacture and distribution of bamboo charcoal, which is already being undertaken in Ghana, Jamaica and several other countries, noting the possibilities for small businesses in making bamboo charcoal briquettes, and the health benefits of substituting smoke-free bamboo charcoal for traditional fuels.

On housing (SDG target 11.1), discussions focused on construction standards and the properties of bamboo-based building products, including their lightness, flexibility, and superior insulating properties, as well as their resistance to fires, land subsidence and seismic activity. Participants noted that bamboo has been successfully used to build emergency shelters, and that the development of new types of resin, which used in conjunction with bamboo-based products, creates non-carcinogenic alternatives to treated pine.

On SDG 13, speakers highlighted the high levels of carbon sequestration in bamboo, and discussed methodologies for calculating the extent of sequestration. They noted that bamboo also has benefits for reducing carbon emissions in terms of emissions that are avoided by substituting bamboo for conventional timber products.

Regarding SDG 15, many participants expressed enthusiasm for cultivating bamboo to restore degraded lands and promote disaster risk reduction (DRR). They noted the value of bamboo as a critical food source for the giant panda, adding that conservation efforts around this iconic species could serve as “a giant umbrella” for the conservation of other species.

Discussions also touched on bamboo and rattan-related activities that promote food security (SDG 2), gender equality through women’s economic empowerment (SDG 5), and innovation in industry (SDG 9), with participants highlighting the market potential of bamboo across a variety of applications, including hi-tech and niche products in healthcare, sporting goods, and bamboo-composite building materials.

The conference adopted in principle the Beijing Declaration, which affirms INBAR member States’ support for developing the global bamboo and rattan industry through assessment of stocks, market and technology research, innovation, and standard setting. The Declaration calls upon national governments and other relevant parties to implement several recommendations, including, inter alia: carrying out inventories and assessments; establishing value chains accessing local, regional, and international markets by way of appropriate standards setting and quality control; encouraging bamboo and rattan technology innovation and research, as well as exchange of know-how. The Declaration also calls for investment from bilateral and multilateral financing mechanisms to support bamboo and rattan programmes and initiatives.

INBAR announced outcomes of BARC 2018 at the end of the conference, including several project agreements and upcoming meetings. Delegates noted agreement to initiate or extend several projects with UN agencies, partners, and donors, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Government of the Netherlands, the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainable Development, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), and conservation agencies willing to collaborate on the Giant Panda National Park that is being established by the Government of China. Further, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) offered to offset the carbon emissions generated by the Congress within the next 10 years through a bamboo-planting project in Yunnan province, China, thus making the Congress a carbon-neutral event.

Also at the meeting’s close, J.C. Hutchinson, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jamaica, announced a Caribbean Bamboo Conference to take place from 27-29 November 2018. It will bring together policy makers from the English-speaking Caribbean with experts from INBAR member States to discuss challenges and opportunities for bamboo in the region.

Official background notes are also available for each of the SDGs under review, and may be accessed by clicking the links in the headings below. Additional inputs submitted by intergovernmental forums, Major Groups and other stakeholders are available here.

SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation

The first in-depth review took place on 9 July 2018, on SDG 6, calling for greater efficiency of water use.

A UN-Water Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation finds that the world is not on track to meet SDG 6. Analyzing global progress towards each target, the report also highlights ways of accelerating progress through integrated water resources management, eliminating inequalities and other means of implementation (MoI). A summary write-up of the report is on the SDG Knowledge Hub here. A guest article also reviews the report, and the role of citizen science in monitoring SDG indicator 6.3.2. A side event on transboundary water cooperation highlighted progress towards 6.5.2, but noted challenges associated with lack of data, particularly around shared aquifers.

A report titled, ‘Global Review of National Accountability Mechanisms for SDG 6,’ commissioned by End Water Poverty & Partners, finds weak accountability mechanisms for water and sanitation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Based on reviews of 25 countries, the report notes, among other lessons, that few of the countries studied use third party validation, and that civil society involvement should be increased. A write-up of the report and HLPF launch event is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A second SDG Knowledge Hub guest article on SDG 6 by Emily Walsh, Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance, highlights the issue of asbestos in US drinking water, outlining how the SDGs can help align efforts.

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy

The in-depth review of SDG 7 took place on 10 July 2018, anticipating the end of coal.

The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) launched a report, titled ‘Delivering SDG 7.’ The report identifies current trends on energy use in transportation, noting how it is improving energy efficiency on a country-by-country basis. Working in over 70 countries, GFEI aims to accelerate the transition to zero emissions vehicles and reduce emissions from the freight industry. The report also outlines where references to fuel economy are found in countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) submitted to the HLPF. A press release on the report is also available.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) released a report titled, ‘New Energy Outlook 2018.’ Based on economic analysis, the report projects trends in renewable energy and fossil fuel costs, estimating that more than 50% of energy demands will be satisfied by wind and solar by 2050. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities

The in-depth review of SDG 11 took place on 11 July 2018, emphasizing the role of cities.

The UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) launched a synthesis report, intended to complement the Secretary-General’s overarching progress report on SDG implementation. Titled, ‘Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilience and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ the report’s chapters outline the importance of the urban dimension to the 2030 Agenda; monitoring efforts and methodologies; and the global baseline status of the targets and indicators under SDG 11. A press release is also available, as is a write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) released an analysis of countries’ 2018 VNRs to highlight the role of the transport sector in achieving the SDGs. The preliminary results show that, despite improving since 2016, there remain gaps on the inclusion of transportation and its contribution to sustainable development, despite the topic being mentioned in 95% of VNRs submitted. The report’s landing page notes that “80% of VNRs refer to the role of sustainable transport in achieving the SDGs but only 12 out of 40 VNRs (30%) offer considerable information with specific cases and policy examples on sustainable transport.” A summary write-up is also available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production

The in-depth review of SDG 12 took place on 12 July 2018, calling for circular economies and sustainable lifestyles.

UN Environment has launched a One Planet Strategy. Titled, ‘One Plan for One Planet 5 Year Strategy 2018-2022,’ the document outlines four common operation objectives, strategic principles and approaches across the One Planet network, which was formed to implement the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP) for which UN Environment serves as Secretariat. It also features an overarching logic model, noting the programme’s outputs, outcomes and impacts.

The Plan’s overarching objectives are to: 1) be an effective implementation mechanism of SDG 12; 2) catalyze ambitious action by providing tools and solutions that support the shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP); 3) lead the cohesive implementation of SCP; and 4) demonstrate the benefits and impacts of SCP and its role in addressing key environmental and social challenges. An overview of side events relating to SCP and SDG12, co-convened by UN Environment and the One Planet network, is available here.

SDG 15 – Life on Land

The in-depth review of SDG 15 took place on 13 July 2018, finding mixed progress.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) released its ‘2018 State of the World’s Forests’ report, which analyzes progress towards sustainable forest management for sub-indicators of SDG 15. The report finds that people who are furthest left behind often live in or near forests. FAO also recognized forests’ role in providing clean water (SDG 6), a source for energy (SDG 7), climate mitigation and adaptation measures (SDG 13), and recreational activities, among other SDGs. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Global Assessment Report was launched by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) at an HLPF side event. Titled, ‘Forest and Water on a Changing Planet: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Governance Opportunities,’ the report articulates the linkages between water management, forests and climate, and answers questions including: do forests matter? Who is responsible and what should be done? How can progress be made and measured? International governance systems and the SDGs, a press release notes, can optimize climate-forest-water relations by creating norms. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

An SDG Knowledge Hub guest article by Cristiana Pașca Palmer, Convention on Biological Diversity, notes that although there have been increasing commitments to implementing SDG 15, the data on available indicators show decline. She offers a ‘to do’ list for Goal 15. A guest article by experts from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identifies solutions that can help achieve healthy forests and ecosystems.

SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals

The in-depth review of SDG 17 took place on 13 July 2018, warning against trade barriers and calling for the fulfillment of aid commitments.

Launched during the HLPF Partnership Exchange the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and The Partnering Initiative (TPI) published a guidebook that seeks to amplify the benefits of partnerships. Titled, ‘Maximising the Impact of Partnerships for the SDGs,’ the guidebook outlines value added to both society and to individual partner organizations, describing how partnerships can be more than the sum of their parts. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Released just prior to the HLPF, a paper by authors from the German NGO Forum on Environment and Development, Unfairtobacco, Global Policy Forum, Misereor (German Catholic Bishops’ Organisation for Development Cooperation), and Bread for the World examines businesses’ contributions to the SDGs. Titled, ‘Highjacking the SDGs? The Private Sector and the Sustainable Development Goals’ the paper notes the difficulties of measuring business engagement with the SDGs, but offers recommendations for policy-makers, businesses and civil society. It features case studies on the financial system—with a focus on bond markets—as well as the tobacco industry. The paper, business-SDG engagement, and findings on the bond market were discussed at an event held at German House on 13 July 2018.

126,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/chief-sustainability-officers-exchange-lessons-on-transforming-businesses/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Chief Sustainability Officers Exchange Lessons on Transforming Businesses,"18 July 2018: A half-day event hosted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) explored how businesses can accelerate “systems transformation.”



Featuring four panels consisting primarily of chief sustainability officers, the event titled, ‘Business and the SDGs – Accelerating Transformation: Insights from Chief Sustainability Officers & Sustainability Champions,’ addressed how companies are integrating the SDGs into operations, human rights, partnerships and investment towards the Goals.

Opening remarks by Liu Zhenmin, Head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), noted that businesses today operate in a geopolitical context that leaves much to be desired. Filippo Veglio, WBCSD, articulated the role of businesses in achieving the SDGs as: an engine of employment; a developer of technology and innovation; and a source of finance. Veglio described the implications of the SDGs for businesses, recalling the CEO Guide to the SDGs and SDG Compass, and highlighted the results of a joint survey of WBCSD members conducted with DNV GL.

In a panel on strategic integration of the SDGs into business practices, panelists highlighted challenges and solutions regarding the complexity of the SDGs and opportunities for impact. Approaches their companies have taken include “retrofitting” existing strategies to fit the SDGs, changing corporate governance structures and launching new sustainability initiatives. One difficulty, they noted, has been balancing the possible tension between generating short-term returns and creating long-term shared value. Doing so demands winning buy-in both internally and externally. Participants reported that they have had to engage buyers and other stakeholders as well as senior management teams and CEOs. Panelists also emphasized the importance of robust measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs), which, they noted, can not only demonstrate a company’s impact, but also align multiple levels of internal management.

Businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing they need to go further on freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing.

Another panel addressed corporate respect for human rights as a key vehicle through which business can contribute to sustainable development. Moderated by Caroline Rees, President and Co-founder of Shift, the discussion articulated how large companies work to uphold human rights throughout their operations and supply chains. Rees outlined the current state of play, noting that businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing the need to go further on others such as freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing. Describing the three pillars of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights, she noted a recent mapping of human rights to the SDGs, and flagged a new Shift report that features 15 case studies on the human rights opportunity for business, linked to the SDGs.

Participants took the discussion further, noting that human rights go beyond SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Andrew Petersen, Sustainable Business Australia (SBA), flagged that SDGs 5 (gender equality) and 10 (reduced inequalities) hit closest to home for SBA’s membership. Tony Henshaw, Aditya Birla Group, said that after the Group signed the WASH Pledge, it realized they needed to do more in the area of water, sanitation and hygiene: “we were 600 bathrooms short.” Tim Fleming, AT&T, noted the enabling power of technology in improving outcomes towards the SDGs, flagging a new Digital Access Index. Panelists also lamented that working across supply chains is difficult, but noted the importance of strict supplier programmes and WBCSD’s Reporting Matters work.

A third panel, on ‘Business as Unusual,’ described how companies can utilize the SDGs to pioneer new forms of collaboration, both at sector- and system-level. Moderator Andrew Wilson, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), argued that the notion of partnerships is overused, and that the private sector partners “for impact.” Unpacking key factors that enable success, participants identified similar characteristics, topics and skills as those which emerged from the HLPF’s Partnership Exchange, including: embracing diversity and differences; simplifying language for communicating between private sector, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media; the ability to build trust; ensuring all stakeholders are present; and the benefits of complementary skill sets to be gained from having partners. Arne Cartridge, Yara International, offered lessons around local ownership aligned with country goals, openness and inclusivity, and a market-driven approach. Michelle Grogg, Cargill, stressed the need for clarity on what partners aim to do together, scalability of projects, a long-term approach, and the need to be innovative, taking risks that go beyond business as usual.

Dominique Debecker, Solvay, described how industries can come together, including through the use of sector roadmaps. These can enhance companies’ license to operate, help them manage risk, and open up new growth markets while setting a common vision, mapping impact on the SDGs, and identifying actions that can be taken in partnership with wider stakeholder groups. Debecker highlighted the release of WBCSD’s Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap, which resulted from multiple workshops involving numerous companies and stakeholders from the industry.

The final panel addressed investor engagement, and how to effectively measure and communicate SDG performance in the face of increasing investor scrutiny. Steve Waygood, Aviva Plc, indicated that failing to deal with SDGs collectively would mean the folding of his business, including because current climate change scenarios represent an existential crisis for the insurance industry. He argued that the “SDGs exist because the market fails”; in other words, if it were already possible to earn money delivering the Goals, governments would not have had to establish the Goals. Bearing this in mind, Waygood stressed that investors do not currently look at how corporates perform on the SDGs because they are externalities, affecting neither companies’ costs nor their revenues. He articulated the need for government-led fiscal measures, market mechanisms, and standards to restructure markets, and noted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance in addition to recent toolkits. The good news, he added, is that investor interest is rapidly increasing.

Timothy Mohin, Chief Executive, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), built on Waygood’s remarks, noting that reporting has been growing, and there is increasing interest from Wall Street in their data. He highlighted a new report titled, ‘In Focus: Addressing Investor Needs in Business Reporting on the SDGs.’ Launched with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and UN Global Compact, the report, he noted, articulates the relevance of the SDGs and the need for a methodology that allows investors to differentiate companies based on their systems for approaching the Goals.

Libby Bernick, Trucost (part of S&P Global), rounded out the panel by underscoring the need for quantitative data. She noted that Trucost is developing a quantitative approach to overlay the SDGs and economic models, and that the rate of change on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments is increasing.

During a session on integrating the NDCs and SDGs at national level, Michael Comstock, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted that SDG-related efforts contribute to NDC goals and vice-versa, given the “distinct but interlinked” processes. He highlighted research from the World Resources Institute (WRI) that finds climate actions align with 154 of the 169 SDG targets. However, he underscored challenges that hinder implementation, particularly the siloing of parallel processes with little communication between ministries despite substantive overlaps and potential duplication. Comstock outlined UNDP support to both the SDG and NDC processes, closing with a preview of a UNDP report titled, ‘Aligning NDCs and SDGs: Lessons Learned and Practical Guidance,’ to be launched later this year. [Presentation on Dialogue Objectives by Michael Comstock, UNDP]

Lee Cando, NDC Partnership, also stressed countries’ challenges of coordination, both horizontally across ministries and development partners, and vertically between national, sub-national and local governments. She flagged NDCs’ interdisciplinary nature, emphasizing that they cut across issues, and are not stand-alone climate or environment issues. Rather, they encompass a wide range of topics, including agriculture (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), transport (SDG 11) and forestry (SDG 15). [Presentation on Transforming NDCs into Action by Lee Cando, NDC Partnership]

Dialogue participants highlighted “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs.

Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute, presented the SDG Climate Action Nexus (SCAN) Tool for linking climate actions to the SDGs. The tool allows for analysis of trade-offs between SDGs that are in conflict, where progress on one may detract from or undermine that of another. However, for all SDGs, she noted, the synergies outweigh the trade-offs. [Presentation on SCAN Tool by Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute]

Representatives from Georgia and Armenia shared their countries’ experiences. Tea Avazashvili, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, Georgia, reviewed steps that the country has taken towards diversifying and improving its energy sources and security, noting policy developments around energy efficiency and renewables, which align closely with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Georgia’s key challenges for incorporating NDC and SDG actions, Avazashvili delineated, include low levels of awareness and lack of human, institutional and regulatory capacity. Asya Murudyan, Ministry of Nature Protection, Armenia, emphasized the country’s actions around adaptation as highlighted in its NDC. [Presentation on Integrating NDCs and SDGs into National Development Planning by Tea Avazashvili, Georgia] [Presentation on Integrating NDCs and SDGs into National Development Planning by Asya Muradyan, Armenia]

With finance often being seen as an opportunity to join up implementation efforts towards the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, participants in the session on private sector engagement acknowledged “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs. Discussions covered strategies and means of implementation that are broadly recognized as contributing to both the climate and development agendas, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), an enabling policy environment and cooperation on green technologies to accelerate society’s transition towards more sustainable economic growth.

The Dialogue also featured discussions on how to integrate gender equality (SDG 5) into NDC implementation. Natasha Olofinskaya, UNDP, highlighted that gender is an enabling factor for all 17 SDGs, noting that it is not only supportive of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, but also has positive impacts on poverty reduction (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2) and health (SDG 3).

128,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-analyzes-countries-readiness-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Analyzes Countries’ Readiness to Leave No One Behind,"18 July 2018: A briefing note and index launched in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) reviews the readiness of 86 countries to “leave no one behind.” With the SDGs in effect for nearly 1,000 days, the Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI) ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018’ explores the extent to which countries have the required data, policies and financing in place.

Elizabeth Stuart, ODI, emphasized during the launch event in New York, US, on 18 July 2018, that “we know what it takes” to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda, as articulated by the Index:

data to identify who is left behind and take stock of progress;

a reprioritization of policies to ensure that affected communities receive the resources they need;

finance, particularly in the areas of education, health and social protection; and

a rethinking of donors’ “risk appetites” to go beyond a poverty reduction agenda.

The 2018 Index builds on an inaugural Index released in 2017, adding a policy indicator on resilience, in line with the theme of the 2018 HLPF. Data collected on the additional indicator show that, of the 86 countries reviewed, more than half (46) are “not ready” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective. Stuart said a new indicator will be added annually, in line with the theme of each year’s HLPF.

The updated Index includes all countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018. On progress, the briefing note highlights that much of the progress made since last year has been in the realm of data, and 11 countries have improved their index score since 2017. Overall, ODI finds that 55 countries are “ready” to meet their commitment, 24 are “partially ready,” five are “not ready,” and two have insufficient data to make an informed assessment. The briefing note concludes that “many countries are insufficiently prepared” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective, with a quarter failing to enact appropriate policy frameworks. Further, the briefing note flags as a concern the finding that, despite the theme of the 2018 HLPF, most countries fail to identify, let alone prioritize, those most at risk of being left behind in the preparation of their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and other adaptation projects. A search of 57 countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change found that almost half did not contain a single mention of ODI’s keywords relating to a leave no one behind agenda.

ODI’s Index considers four indicators of outcomes: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment.

During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, highlighted that the leave no one behind terminology can “mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people,” and can be viewed from a variety of lenses, including income, geography, gender or location. On this, he noted a UNDP discussion paper to be released in the coming weeks titled, ‘What does it mean to leave no one behind?’ that will present a framework for implementation. Steiner also flagged that the SDGs are not a starting point, but rather a reminder of what we have left to do, following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. He and Stuart acknowledged, however, that the SDGs were agreed during a “high water mark for multilateralism,” and that in today’s very different political environment it is important to “keep driving through” and continue a positive narrative.

Isidoro Santana, Minister of Economy, Planning and Development, Dominican Republic, outlined challenges his country is facing, especially on tax capacity and domestic resource mobilization. He lamented that although a significant amount of public funding goes towards education, this leaves other social issues unattended. He noted that the Dominican Republic and many other middle-income countries (MICs) face a decline in official development assistance (ODA) at a time when domestic resources are not yet able to fill the finance gap, and addressing this could help to deliver the leave no one behind agenda.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, Canada, described measures that her government has taken to achieve leaving no one behind domestically, highlighting indigenous communities, affordable housing, and safe, clean drinking water as areas needing more action. She noted policy reforms that aim to lift children out of poverty, enhance workers’ benefits, and introduce a rights framework for indigenous communities, calling the SDGs an opportunity to link the “usual and unusual suspects together.” Caesar-Chavannes also emphasized Canada’s “feminist foreign policy,” saying it provides a gateway to being able to name and talk about those who are left behind. She noted investments in Canada’s national statistics office to add capacity on disaggregation and better tracking of outcomes.

While ODI’s Index primarily focuses on countries’ readiness to leave no one behind, it also considers four indicators of outcomes in order to demonstrate actual progress: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment. It aggregates data on these outcomes to assess whether countries are on track to leave no one behind, scoring them as on track, off track or making partial progress.

ODI’s analysis finds “a clear correlation” between countries’ readiness and outcome scores.

The groups launched the ‘UN Biodiversity Lab’ at the 22nd meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA 22).

According to UNDP, many countries lack access to geospatial data because of limited technical capacity. The UN Biodiversity Lab will address this limitation by providing spatial data via a free, cloud-based tool that users can access to inform conservation decision-making and support monitoring and reporting. The Lab’s website includes stories of how inclusion of spatial data in biodiversity and conservation planning has informed governments’ dialogue, policy and monitoring. For instance, Ecuador used spatial data to address deforestation, and South Africa protected coastal and marine resources after using open spatial data to inform stakeholder discussions.

Data covers protected areas, species, climate, land, marine areas, human impacts on natural systems and socio-economic data.

The Lab includes spatial data on protected areas, endangered species, climate and carbon, land cover, marine areas, human impacts on natural systems and socio-economic data. Data on ecosystem services, natural hazards and restoration will be added in the future. Going forward, the Lab is also expected to incorporate automated monitoring using artificial intelligence (AI).

At the launch event at SBSTTA 22 in Montreal, Canada, on 5 July 2018, UNDP and UNEP challenged the 196 Parties to the CBD to “double the number of maps used in their national progress reports to the CBD.” UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim described the Lab as “a vital part of our ongoing efforts to build a digital ecosystem of planetary data that is accurate and easy to use by countries, companies and citizens” in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The creation of the UN Biodiversity Lab aligns with calls for innovative tools to monitor conservation trends and for enhanced access to big data for sustainable development, such as in the ‘Nature for Development Declaration on Spatial Data.’ According to CBD Executive Secretary Cristiana Pașca Palmer, the Lab can “enable Parties to utilize spatial data to deliver on their commitments to the CBD and to fundamentally transform biodiversity conservation and sustainable use decision making and reporting.”

The UN Biodiversity Lab uses spatial data from UN agencies, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC), the Global Resource Information Database (GRID-Geneva), the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and others. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) provided core funding for the Lab, which is powered by MapX.

Disruptive trends are becoming increasingly important because they change the way we think, behave or do business. They uproot traditional thinking and alter the way we go about our day-to-day activities, as many of the technologies underpinning them are more powerful and interlinked than ever. The SDG Trend Scanner initiative will enable companies, the public sector, and other stakeholders to strategically use trends as drivers for accelerated progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including by catalyzing scalable innovations and opportunities for public-private partnerships.

“Disruptive trends in technologies, business models and values, sometimes perceived as threats, can be harnessed and leveraged to empower people and countries to pursue their development aspirations. We look forward to working with RISE and explore the opportunities that our joint SDG Trend Scanner initiative provides,” said Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Director of UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support.

Through this joint initiative, UNDP and RISE will engage with key stakeholders such as the industry leaders, international organizations and academia to help facilitate a platform for collaboration and partnerships. The initiative will also explore ways for different stakeholders to leverage disruptive trends through collaborative research, innovative pilots in specific areas, development of new tools or expansion of existing tools to leverage trends for global sustainability, and capacity development of policymakers and relevant stakeholders towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.

Ms. Kajsa B Olofsgård, Sweden’s Ambassador for the 2030 Agenda, stated, “We live in times with fast technological and societal changes; with a need to understand and adapt in a pace we are not accustomed to. The challenges raised by climate change, conflicts and increasing amounts of people in vulnerable conditions are also more imperative than ever. We must be capable of finding solutions and actions that not only present a short-term relief but takes us in the direction of the world we want to create for ourselves and for coming generations. The SDG Trend Scanner initiative will provide us with better basis for wise decisions.”

“Global sustainability and the 2030 Agenda are rapidly emerging as key drivers for innovation. For RISE this collaboration is an important step towards our goal to become a stronger innovation partner for businesses and society. We will bring decades of innovation experience and look forward to use different parts of our organization in collaboration with UNDP to ensure a successful outcome of the SDG Trend Scanner initiative,” said RISE CEO Pia Sandvik.

Achievers? Influencers? Leaders?



It’s an incredible list, of incredible women. And they have something in common: members of the G7’s first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council, established by Canada as part of their 2018 G7 presidency, to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment across all areas of the G7’s work.

The Council’s report Make Gender Inequality History is resolute and persuasive. It calls on G7 leaders to take concrete actions to ensure that girls and women are safe, healthy, educated, heard and visible. The recommendations reinforce the SDG goals and targets. One of the priority areas is to deliver comprehensive, women-centered and culturally appropriate health care for all girls, women and gender diverse people. The Council sets out 8 recommendations to achieve ‘gender-responsive health systems [that will] uphold girls’ and women’s essential rights to health, and promote safe, healthy, and functioning societies and strong economic growth and development’. These include Universal Health Coverage (UHC), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), access to quality maternal and newborn health, food security and nutrition, the health needs of girls and women in conflict and humanitarian settings and the meaningful engagement of adolescent girls and young people.

The G7 has recognised the Council’s work and its focus on comprehensive health services for girls and women. In its Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique of 9 June 2018 the G7 has committed ‘to promote and protect women’s and adolescents’ health and well-being’, ‘to supporting strong, sustainable health systems that promote access to quality and affordable healthcare’ and that ‘gender equality is fundamental for the fulfilment of human rights and is a social and economic imperative’. The G7 commitment is welcomed.



Converting commitments into action will depend on one key issue: the role of women as providers of care. Their role as health workers. Women represent the majority of the human resources we have to expand and transform the world’s health systems and fulfill the goals of universal health coverage and sexual reproductive health and rights. In 2016, the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth drew on compelling new evidence that 67% of all health workers are women; nearly seven out of every ten jobs in the health sector. The average in all other labour sectors is 41%. These women, be they managers, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, therapists and numerous other health occupations, are the foundation of health systems and a critical factor in whether we attain comprehensive health services for girls and women. It is these women who are Working for Health. Indeed, the ambition of Universal Health Coverage will be won or lost on how governments and health systems manage people. People need health care. People govern health care. And its people, the health workers – mostly women – that deliver it.","Their role as health workers.

One major goal of the HLPF is to review the qualitative status of the targets so as to improve water quality by 2030.

One important indicator for reviewing targets is indicator 6.3.2: ‘Proportion of bodies of waters with good ambient water quality’.

Governments face here one major challenge: the water quality data gap. Whereas there are common indicators to measure water quality such as pH, temperature, or the total amount of nitrogen, such indicators are not measured thoroughly for a comprehensive understanding of water quality. As the 6.3.2 indicator report highlights, many custodian agencies lack institutional structures and coordination to collate data and mobilize necessary personnel (United Nations, 2018).

In hopes of tackling the problem, there are signs for a shift from traditional data gathering – government authorities monitoring water quality through extensive networks – to additionally gathering data through citizen-led water quality monitoring activities. The thematic review paper for HLPF focusing on volunteer groups specifically refers to SDG 6, pinpointing the importance of citizens testing water samples in ensuring safe water and sanitation for all (HLPF, 2018).

‘Citizen Science’: Is it really useful to address the water quality data gap?

A relatively new concept, citizen-led monitoring is also referred to as ‘Citizen Science.’ It is one of the avenues suggested by the custodian agencies of SDG 6.3.2. But is the involvement of citizens really useful to address the water quality data gap?

According to Oxford Dictionary (2018), citizen science is “the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.” In other words, it refers to the involvement of citizens in scientific projects.

Such involvement can have important advantages, particularly in data collection. Because any citizen can go out to collect data, data samples are potentially large. Such data can also be collected in a cost-effective manner, and it can speed up and improve environmental detection. In other words, the more people are collecting good quality data, the higher the chances of detecting environmental changes early on.

Citizen science thus makes projects possible to operate at larger geographic scales and over longer periods of time, depending on available human and capital resources. For instance, the National Water Quality Monitoring Council points out that there are more than 1,720 citizen science groups just across the US, carrying out volunteer water quality monitoring (National Water Quality Monitoring Council n.d.). Earthwatch supported approximately 1,400 field research projects in more than 120 countries, as well as over 100,000 people joining Earthwatch projects to contribute 10 million hours of data collection (FreshWaterWatch n.d.).

However, literature points out that citizen science also has shortcomings. Collected data by volunteers may be skewed or biased because the volunteers may not have appropriate scientific knowledge and training to gather accurate data. Also, motivating volunteers to participate in water quality monitoring scientific projects can be quite difficult since volunteers may also lack necessary laboratory equipment and funding for proper data collection. Lastly, people tend to be selective about which citizen science project they participate in because interests vary. Particular public attention and funding, for example, are given to biodiversity monitoring of attractive species such as wolves, bears, and certain birds (McKinley et al., 2017).

The way forward for citizen science in water quality monitoring

Vigorous discussion is ongoing on how to overcome these obstacles in citizen science. The motivation of non-scientists to participate in citizen science can be increased by providing recognition and attribution for the work they have done, and when they gain feedback from the scientists on how their data were put to use. Analyses also point to increased motivation when the volunteers felt involved within the community. Furthermore, citizen science data can also have high statistical power if data samples are large, which has potential for correcting flawed and biased data.

So, is citizen science an effective method for tackling the water quality data gap? Literature reviews and a quick review of citizen science projects suggest that involving citizens in water quality monitoring has strong potential, that’s for sure. But to fully benefit from the involvement of citizens, possible bottlenecks have to be overcome.

At the United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we thus argue for well-designed citizen science projects in the field of water quality monitoring, considering lessons learnt from existing projects and other fields of practice. The custodian agencies could consider providing guidelines for good citizen science projects and encourage Member States to implement well-designed citizen science projects for resolving the water quality data gap.

The report assesses country progress in NBSAP development and national implementation and country readiness to meet the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The 10th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 10) adopted the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Aichi Target 17 calls on each CBD Party to develop, adopt and implement an “effective, participatory and updated NBSAP” by 2015. The report titled, ‘Assessment of Post -2010 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans,’ reviews 115 NBSAPs submitted by September 2016. These post-2010 NBSAPs are also referred to as “second-generation” NBSAPs.

According to the report, mainstreaming “has been difficult to put into practice at the national level.”

The report focuses on Parties’ readiness to mainstream biodiversity across sectoral policies and plans. According to the report, biodiversity mainstreaming “has been difficult to put into practice at the national level,” with historically poor correlation between NBSAPs and sectoral or cross-sectoral policies. Despite this challenge, the report underscores the importance of biodiversity mainstreaming for achieving both the Aichi Targets and the SDGs. A large number of the second generation NBSAPs, particularly those from least developed countries (LDCs), now align themselves with broader cross-sectoral policies and plans related to poverty alleviation and development. Nearly all NBSAPs address the agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors but few address extractive industries, the energy sector or infrastructure development.

On vertical mainstreaming, the report finds that more attention has been paid to the devolution of authority in the second generation NBSAPs and that a large number of NBSAPs explicitly recognize the need for action on biodiversity mainstreaming at the local level. For example, the report highlights Peru’s NBSAP, which recognizes that governance is most efficient and effective and involves citizens when it is “as close as possible to the resources to be managed.”

The report further assesses the preparation and adoption of NBSAPs as a policy instrument, reflecting that the most successful processes adopt a bottom-up, participatory approach to ensure commitment to and ownership of implementation. The report highlights Antigua and Barbuda, Cabo Verde and Peru as countries with particularly broad, extensive NBSAP processes. According to the report, most NBSAPs are adopted by the national authority responsive for the CBD, such as a Ministry of Environment. In Hungary and Norway, the national parliaments adopted the respective NBSAPs.

The report concludes that the second-generation NBSAPs have increased correlation with poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies and offer positive potential for mutually supportive implementation of the NBSAPs and the SDGs. The report further concludes that the second-generation NBSAPs contain much more direct and focused goals, targets and actions but expresses concern that mainstreaming of goals and targets may not be fully coordinated at the political level with sectoral ministries.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

Bringing together experts from over 100 organizations across the UK, the report offers the first comprehensive review of SDG delivery in the country, covering all 17 Goals and 143 of the 169 targets. Emily Auckland, UKSSD Co-Chair, emphasized that the scope primarily focuses on domestic delivery of the SDGs within the UK, and that the report does not compare the UK to other countries. On the authoring process, she explained that each chapter of ‘Measuring Up’ —the first section of which reviews progress on a Goal-by-Goal basis—was led by one or two UKSSD members, based on their strengths and area of expertise. The report’s second section examines procedural aspects of SDG delivery in the UK, including governance arrangements and the roles of stakeholders.

The report finds that the UK performs well on 24% of the targets, has performance gaps on 57%, and shows little to no policy change or otherwise poor performance on 15%. For 3% of targets, there were not enough data available to make an informed assessment. The report utilized publicly available data from international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank, as well as from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). UKSSD also notes that in authoring the report, they identified data gaps on the UK’s impacts abroad, including through supply chains and on marine pollution. Although accounting for the country’s global reach is embedded in the thinking, UKSSD noted, additional measures are needed take stock to take stock.

Areas of high performance include SDGs 3, 4 and 17. The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15.

Areas of high performance by the UK include SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15 (life on land), and on several Goals (2, 5, 9 and 13) not a single target is marked as green (“good”). In terms of efficiently accelerating progress, the report notes that although the UK’s implementation framework of Single Departmental Plans (SDPs) are a practical way of delegating authority, there is a risk that doing so will reduce recognitions of interlinkages across the Goals and targets, thereby siloing efforts or reduce their effectiveness. Thus, the report calls for cross-departmental action to ensure policy coherence.

Dominic White, Co-Chair, UKSSD, highlighted that the report is put forth in the spirit of collaboration, offered in lieu of government capacity, to recognize what a performance review looks like from a stakeholder perspective. He emphasized synergies between the UK and global contexts, noting that this is “where sustainable development comes home.” On methodology, he underscored the stringency of the review, noting that UKSSD applied the “leave no one behind” principle when analyzing targets: if a person or group is not getting the full benefits of a target, the target is not scored as green.

Looking ahead, White described the ‘Measuring Up’ report and the UK’s intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 HLPF as opening a “policy window” where experiences can be built on and taken further, and gaps identified by the report can be addressed. The discussion also raised the broader importance of “voluntary stakeholder reviews” (VSRs), which can serve as a baseline for, or to complement, inform, strengthen—or in some cases refute—countries’ official VNRs on progress towards the SDGs.

The event follows the report’s initial launch, held at the UK House of Commons on 3 July 2018. The ‘Measuring Up’ project has been supported by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Pearson, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Sodexo, DNV GL, PwC, Stakeholder Forum and Thai Union.

138,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wri-report-recommends-greater-alignment-of-sdg-ndc-implementation-to-enhance-action/,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WRI Report Recommends Greater Alignment of SDG, NDC Implementation to Enhance Action","17 July 2018: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change should be implemented jointly to help scale up actions and impact, according to a study that finds that, in most countries, climate actions under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national targets under the SDGs have been defined and advanced separately.

The paper, which was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), examines the ways in which the alignment of the two processes can be increased, despite their distinct histories, communities of actors and political dynamics.

The paper titled, ‘Connecting the Dots: Elements for a Joined-Up Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement,’ explains that the SDGs and climate actions embedded in NDCs are still largely implemented under distinct tracks, despite growing recognition of the strong connections between the two agendas, the opportunities they present for synergies, and the “short window of opportunity” for addressing the interlinked challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, poverty, rising inequality and fragile governance.

Drawing on examples and lessons learned from 11 countries and the EU, the publication outlines efforts to bridge the two implementation tracks, and explains that a growing number of countries have began taking concrete steps to advance both agendas as one. More specifically, the report provides options and examples for linking institutional, policy, financial, and monitoring and reporting frameworks that support joint implementation, which can reduce transaction costs and enhance policy coherence.

The paper describes five areas where countries are taking action to jointly implement the agenda: 1) ensuring institutional coordination; 2) ensuring alignment of and synergies between nationally relevant SDG targets and climate actions; 3) mainstreaming the SDGs and NDCs jointly into national planning and budgets; 4) optimizing financial resources; and 5) designing mutually supportive monitoring and reporting frameworks.

Cross-fertilization between SDG and NDC targets can lead to greater ambition.

On coordinating institutions, the paper explains that SDG and NDC lead institutions can build on their different strengths and authorities to more effectively engage governments and other stakeholders, and calls for consistent leadership and bringing the climate and development communities together.

On alignment of and synergies between SDG and NDC targets, the paper notes that climate policymakers have acknowledged limited understanding of the ways in which the SDGs can support climate policymaking, while sector ministries often view NDCs as technical documents that are difficult for use in policy planning. It explains that cross-fertilization and alignment can lead to greater ambition, and calls for designing single long-term carbon-neutral, sustainable development strategies.

The paper states that while few countries have sought greater alignment, Mexico released a study identifying NDC actions with the greatest SDG benefits as priority “development accelerators.” In addition, Kenya undertook an SDG impact assessment for its National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022. Both studies, it notes, call for, inter alia, measures to maximize climate action benefits on inequality reduction and gender equality.

On jointly mainstreaming both agendas into policy planning and budgeting, the paper recommends: sector-specific guidelines; consistent use of performance frameworks and budget-tagging systems that consider the objectives of both agendas; a comprehensive gap analysis of both agendas; monitoring; and involving SDG and NDC lead institutions in planning processes. The paper discusses Colombia’s use of consistent guidelines and support for building the SDGs and NDCs into local development plans, and explains that several countries have also started reviewing and enforcing SDG-NDC mainstreaming.

On optimizing budgetary and financial resources, the paper recommends, inter alia, mobilizing and tracking SDG-related and climate finance, and integrated fiscal and regulatory reforms to help scale up finance for both agendas.

On mutually reinforcing monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks, the paper states that: consistent sets of SDG, climate and other development indicators and common data strategies support integrated monitoring of outcomes, and national progress reports can more systematically address SDG-climate linkages. It outlines the ways in which the Philippines, Finland and Kenya have assessed the relevance of global SDG indicators in monitoring climate actions, especially adaptation, noting that several countries have included SDG and NDC reporting in annual growth reviews and budget processes.

In addition, the report describes the ways in which international development can better support national efforts to link the two agendas, and urges development partners to support national efforts to link implementation efforts through an integrated approach to capacity building and project planning.

The report suggests that global reporting frameworks under the Paris Agreement and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) could better support national efforts to merge SDG and NDC implementation, and contends that the HLPF and Talanoa Dialogue offer near-term opportunities for countries to develop synergies to ramp up national ambitions.

The report examines challenges facing youth-led innovation for the SDGs and proposes recommendations to create more integrated ecosystems of support for youth change makers.

The second edition of the ‘Youth Solutions Report’ features SDG solution projects led by youth innovators in academia, business, charity and research, with the aim of showcasing their work and highlighting opportunities for potential investors to support the projects. Projects are classified in three categories: design, pilot and prototyping phase; implementation phase (less than 18 months); and implementation phase (more than 18 months). Projects must take into consideration synergies and trade-offs to the SDGs and have potential impacts that are measureable within the SDG indicator framework.

The report’s solutions, which come from 61 countries, deal with crucial sustainable development issues, including clean energy, education, digitalization, e-participation, healthcare, ecosystem restoration, sustainable agriculture and waste. As an illustration, NatureCoin in South Korea aims to stop the discharge of plastics into the seas using disruptive technology in environmental protection that rewards users of a cryptocurrency when they recycle disposable waste. The initiative addresses SDG 9 (industry, innovation, infrastructure); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report analyzes barriers young people face in accessing financing, mentoring opportunities and generating visibility for their solutions. On financing, the report recommends developing a robust investment pipeline and designing youth-focused funding vehicles for the SDGs. For instance, SDSN Youth is supporting a pipeline of high-quality solutions to fund. To address the lack of visibility on youth-led solutions, the report highlights the potential of social media to level the playing field by enabling youth to connect and interact with the world. The report suggests that governments and other stakeholders can support such interactions by improving internet infrastructure and access and adjusting attitudes towards young entrepreneurs, among other actions.

On monitoring and review, the report stresses the importance of aligning youth solutions within the SDG indicator framework and considers opportunities for young innovators to support SDG follow-up and review. The report argues that aligning youth-led solutions with SDG targets and metrics can position youth to enhance the impact and efficiency of their solutions and connect youth initiatives with SDG-oriented funders.

SDSN will host a series of digital activations to raise awareness on the report’s solutions, including a Twitter chat on 10 August.

On the final day, 11 countries presented their VNRs, bringing the total number of participating countries to 46.



The HLPF convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) from 9-18 July 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with the Ministerial Meeting taking place from 16-18 July, and held jointly with ECOSOC’s High-level Segment. The meeting focused on the theme of ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’

The Bahamas’ VNR presentation noted the vulnerability of The Bahamas given its location in a volatile hurricane zone, and outlined challenges, including in sectors related to poverty, youth unemployment, education, health, energy efficiency, and coastal resilience. He outlined SDG-related plans to promote land reform, empowerment, and backyard farming. Romania’s VNR presentation described work across national and local governments to advance the SDGs, and highlighted: breaking down silos to address a complex agenda; the need for stability to support human rights; and the importance of SDG implementation, commencing with individual lifestyles.

Lebanon’s VNR presentation emphasized the country adopted a bottom-up and “whole of government” approach to SDG implementation. The presentation highlighted good progress in education, heath, women, poverty reduction and development of small and medium enterprises and recognized the need for more work in areas improving statistical capabilities. Hungary’s VNR presentation focused on: water management; a sustainable energy strategy, which includes a programme to promote the use of electric cars; a focus on sustainable cities, which includes housing, climate change and air quality-related components; and a national strategy on sustainable consumption and production (SCP).

Malta’s VNR presentation highlighted: a high and steady economic growth rate; investments in skills development and health and education, especially on life-long opportunities for education and training; a high employment rate; and efforts to ensure gender equality and social inclusion, including of persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. Poland’s VNR presentation described social, economic and environmental initiatives, including ones to: help families with children through cash transfers; assist the elderly; promote innovation, research, and development through tax relief; help start-ups; and deal with air pollution. In response to questions, Poland noted measures to implement a circular economy; address water management; and tackle air pollution as part of efforts to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Singapore’s VNR presentation highlighted: the implementation of integrated closed-loop systems for recycling water and waste materials; an integrated long-term planning for sustainable cities, including an emphasis on urban greenery; and a long-lasting commitment to combine environmentalism and development, particularly in the area of water management. On SDG 13 (climate action), Singapore said it is one of the first Asian nations to implement a national carbon tax and described a Climate Action Package, which aims to develop climate resilience capacity in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Spain’s VNR presentation focused on: high levels of inequality and youth unemployment; high levels of gender violence; large pay gaps between men and women; high levels of women’s participation in politics (11 out of the 16 ministers are women); and high vulnerability to climate change.

Saudi Arabia’s VNR presentation highlighted: a national water strategy to achieve universal clean water access; the involvement of women and youth in urban planning; and local partnerships for SDG implementation. Responding to questions, Saudi Arabia noted close collaboration between ministers and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund plans to increase investments in renewables. Paraguay’s VNR presentation addressed institutional processes such as the establishment of audits and indicators for monitoring progress on the SDGs; programmes fighting violence against children and adolescents; and ongoing efforts to improve the well-being and living standards of indigenous peoples and rural communities, among other actions. Paraguay identified the need for greater statistical capacities as a future challenge.

Qatar’s VNR presentation showcased: plans to increase economic growth; improvements in the literacy rate; reduced youth unemployment; and the country’s universal access to clean drinking water. Qatar said it leads the Middle East and North Africa peace index.

On stakeholder participation, The Bahamas said it does not have a strong culture of engagement with civic organizations. Romania acknowledged the importance of involving universities in the VNRs. Lebanon highlighted the inclusion of CSOs in the VNR drafting process and elaborated on private sector involvement in the 2030 Agenda, which took place primarily through the UN Global Compact network for Lebanon. Hungary described youth participation in the SDGs and efforts to promote inclusivity of disadvantaged people, such as Roma communities. Singapore and Spain both shared their countries’ multi-stakeholder approaches to SDG implementation, with Spain explaining it has 50 organizing platforms for civil society participation and decentralization in SDG implementation. Saudi Arabia highlighted coordinated support of the private sector and civil society. Qatar emphasized the contributions of civil society to SDG implementation and the drafting of the VNR.

Several countries highlighted alignment of national development plans and strategies with the 2030 Agenda, including Poland and Paraguay. Malta elaborated on a national law mandating mainstreaming of sustainable development in all policies. Saudi Arabia described the alignment between Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’ and the SDGs. Spain said it has a national committee for SDG implementation and a research and development strategy for the SDGs.

According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), the 46 VNRs presented during the 2018 session provided a “good snapshot of action on the ground, but also of the numerous challenges faced by national and local actors.” The ENB noted that the challenge of capacity and financial resources, notably in a number of developing countries, was a recurring issue among the VNRs, and reflected that the level of participation of non-state actors in the preparation of the VNRs varied among countries in scale and depth. The ENB underscored some frustration among participants at the lack of follow-up to and feedback on the VNRs, and suggestions for more clear and consistent reporting methodologies.

The challenge was launched by The Climate Group and C40 Cities on 10 July 2018 in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene in San Francisco, US, from 12-14 September 2018. It urges the global auto industry to accelerate the manufacture of electric vehicles and increase production to fulfill growing demand, bringing together the collective purchasing power and influence on the market of stakeholders and existing programmes, which have until now been focused on separate sectors. In this way, the challenge provides an opportunity for the auto sector to take the lead in the large-scale transition to electric vehicles and help deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The ZEV Challenge calls on:

automakers to signal their willingness to work towards an endgame for combustion engine vehicles running on fossil fuels, and in the meantime, commit to a ZEV percentage of sales by 2025;

more multinational businesses to join EV100, which brings together forward-looking companies committed to fleet electrification and making electric transport the ‘new normal’ by 2030; and

states and regions to join a new Under2 Coalition ZEV initiative that focuses on procurement, infrastructure and policy.

The challenge is currently being supported by the State of California, EDF Energy, LeasePlan, Unilever, New York City, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Rome, Mexico City, Medellín, Copenhagen, Pittsburgh, and the regions of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Navarra, Spain.

The Navarra region of Spain has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them.

Several countries like France and the UK have already announced end dates for the sale of fossil fuel-run vehicles, and the State of California has committed to putting five million zero-emission vehicles on roads and highways by 2030.

Speaking about the challenge, Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto said governments have the purchasing power to force manufacturers to provide off-the-shelf electric vehicle technologies. Mexico City Mayor José Ramón Amieva said his city is already working on the country’s first electric bus corridor.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan noted the city’s introduction of the world’s first Ultra Low Emission Zone beginning in April 2019, which will provide the opportunity for industry and government to work together to create more sustainable cities. Shane Rattenbury, ACT Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, noted the ACT government’s commitment to a zero emissions passenger vehicle fleet from 2019-2020 and a 100% renewable electricity supply from 2020.

Manu Ayerdi, Vice-President for Economic Development, Navarra, Spain, said his region has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them. Medellín Mayor Federico Gutierrez Zuluaga said buses in the city’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system will be equipped with electric buses.

The authors argue that how a country will perform on a specific SDG indicator is dependent on progress on other SDGs, and they introduce the concepts of “SDG proximity,” “SDG centrality” and “SDG density” to consider specific indicators.



The Policy Research Working Paper titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals Diagnostics An Application of Network Theory and Complexity Measures to Set Country Priorities,’ uses a database on SDG progress, constructed using data from the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG‐SDGs), the World Bank’s SDG database (WB‐SDGs), and additional external data. The database includes the majority of “Tier 1” indicators, as categorized by the IAEG-SDGs.

The authors posit that “if a set of positive development outcomes are observed frequently coexisting across countries, then there are strong commonalities” in their underlying delivery mechanisms. The methodology considers 1) country capacities such as skills, infrastructure, technology, institutions and natural resources; 2) countries’ SDG delivery mechanisms, whether intentionally or unintentionally created; and 3) the resulting observable development outcomes.

The authors note that the extent to which capacities can be used between SDGs is dependent on their proximity to one another. They define “SDG proximity” as the conditional probability of two indicators being “successful” together, a function of the commonalities shared. For example, the indicator “number of physicians per 1,000 people” is likely to have more commonalities with—and be closer in proximity to—an indicator to measure malnutrition than it would with one on marine protected areas.

If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with many “proximities,” the country is likely to also achieve progress in others.

The sum of a Goal’s proximities provides its measure of “SDG centrality,” the paper explains. If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with high centrality, the country is likely to also achieve progress in others. SDGs 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 6 (clean water and sanitation) are calculated to be the most “central,” while Goals 1 (no poverty) and 13 (climate action) are calculated to be the least central.

The highest-ranked indicators in terms of centrality relate to access to electricity, and populations using improved drinking water sources. The least central indicators address varied themes, including gender parity, disaster risk reduction strategies, education, time spent on unpaid domestic work, employment in agriculture, malaria incidence rates, and the number of breeds classified as being not-at-risk of extinction, among others. However, the authors caution against “writing off” an SDG or indicator as irrelevant simply because it features limited connections.

To prioritize actions, the authors cite the importance of an SDG’s “density” in a country. This is defined on the basis of the Goal’s proximities to others in which the country is successful. It will be easier to make progress on a high-density SDG than a low-density SDG. The paper suggests that governments can use the concepts of SDG proximity, centrality and density to redeploy SDG delivery mechanisms or other capacities, in order to maximize impact.

The authors highlight that other recent work also focuses on SDG interconnectedness, the probability of over-performing on a specific target given progress on others, and whether achievement of some targets promotes or accelerates progress on others. These include recent efforts by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), David Le Blanc for the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), and implementation of the Country Development Diagnostics Framework.

Even non-economists can gather from this statement that creating an efficient market-based mechanism to determine a price on carbon is no easy task. While many emissions trading schemes (ETS) that have been implemented around the world over the last decade are proof that market-based pricing mechanisms can work, they have also revealed that concerns about their effectiveness in providing a long-term incentive to invest in climate mitigation were well founded.

One such concern is that an ETS may result in a price that is too low or too volatile to act as a meaningful incentive. The EU ETS has often been cited as an example of this problem with critics noting that the average price that resulted in past years is not meaningful to nudge large emitters into accelerated mitigation action. This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

Is a Minimum Price on Carbon Desirable?

To address concerns around the effectiveness of the EU ETS, some EU Member States are considering introducing additional measures, such as an EU-wide or national carbon pricing floors (CPFs) that would guarantee a minimum price on carbon emissions for all market participants.

Germany and France for example agreed, in a Joint Declaration on further cooperation in Europe, to develop an ‘EU Strategy 2050’ for the long-term transformation towards carbon neutrality. The countries propose a high-level ministerial working group on climate change to build a common view on the energy transition as well as tools for triggering sustainable finance and economic incentives, including carbon pricing issues. [German Government Press Release: Meseberg Declaration – Renewing Europe’s promises of security and prosperity]

CPFs that apply to an entire ETS have been implemented using various mechanisms, including:

an auction reserve price that creates a minimum price below which a government withholds a number of allowances from sale;

a top-up payment or carbon price that is designed either as a tax that makes up the difference between the CPF level and the ETS allowance price or as a fixed price which is added to it;

or a system of permit buybacks, where the market operator commits to buying back permits at the floor price.

A key question for regional markets, such as the EU ETS, is whether national and regional prices can coexist. Under a national carbon floor pricing mechanism, a country would be allowed to set a minimum price for emissions that may or may not be higher than the supra-national ETS market price. Several institutions have recently published opposing views on this question.

Yes, if the Conditions are Right.

A study by the Cambridge Energy Research Group entitled “When is carbon pricing desirable?” supports the introduction of an EU-wide power sector CPF. The paper recommends that such a CPF be designed as a carbon levy to “top up” the European Emission Allowances (EUA) price to €25–30/tCO2, rising at 3–5% annually above the rate of inflation, at least until 2030.

The authors argue that this approach would not only address the risk of a “too low” carbon price, but also provide longer-term prices and bring forward low-carbon investment by guaranteeing a minimum return to emissions reductions. They further suggest the delivery of climate benefits through a CPF would be enhanced by the new market stability reserve (MSR) of the EU ETS. The MSR, which will begin to operate in January 2019, will withhold from the market 24% of the calculated EUA oversupply each year from 2019-2023, and 12% of the surplus each year thereafter. From 2023, if the MSR volume exceeds the EUA volume auctioned in the previous year, this excess will be ‘invalidated’ or removed from the MSR. This cancellation mechanism is expected to remove a substantial number of EUAs.

The research group also recognizes that national CPFs are easier to implement than an EU-wide CPF, but notes they pose the risk of intra-EU trade distortions. In addition, a national CPF may need to be accompanied by an emissions performance standard to enhance durability. [Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group Paper “When is carbon pricing desirable?”]

No, because it Increases Costs and Risks of Carbon Leakage

Taking a contrasting view, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) called on EU Member States to refrain from introducing national CPFs or taxes. Focusing on several industry sectors in addition to the power sector, IETA cautions such measures would lead to competitive distortions, negatively impact industrial low carbon investment strategies and reduce the EU ETS’s efficiency. The authors emphasize the risk of carbon leakage from the country imposing the national mechanism and the risk of creating a barrier to linking with ETS in other jurisdictions. They suggest instead of introducing additional taxes, Member States should assess the potential to extend coverage of the EU ETS to additional sectors and gases.

If Member States do decide to introduce additional carbon price measures, IETA recommends such measures be temporary, arguing that the system absorbs accumulated surplus through the MSR. They advise member states: ensure a high degree of coordination to minimize market distortions and fragmentation; transparently quantify their impact in terms of emission reductions within the scope of the EU ETS; and voluntarily cancel an adequate amount of allowances from their auction volumes in order to mitigate the impact of the measure on the functioning of the EU ETS. [IETA Position Paper]

Healthy Discourse Contributes to Improvements of Carbon Markets

These diverging positions on CPFs show that fixing the shortcomings of current carbon market mechanisms won’t be easy. On the other hand, the debate is also proof that both sides share an interest in improving the effectiveness of the EU ETS. In medicine, treatments are reviewed for improvements, and where such are not observed other treatments, including in combination, are tried aiming at increasing effectiveness and success. In a similar way, policy debates around measures to address climate change often reveal diverging views and heterogeneous preferences of experts and governments. While coming to an agreement may take some time, the commitment to a healthy, evidence-based debate is an encouraging sign that carbon mechanisms are maturing into an effective tool that will ultimately overcome the barriers predicted by economists.","This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.
A key question for regional markets, such as the EU ETS, is whether national and regional prices can coexist.

In some ways Ant-Man and the Wasp is the kind of movie I wanted Ant-Man to be: namely, a refreshing antidote to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It’s not just the light, breezy tone and the witty gags. Humor is nothing new to the MCU; on the contrary, obligatory Guardians-style whimsy has become a jarring and even cynical tonal anomaly in apocalypses like Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.

But there’s a lightness to Ant-Man and the Wasp that goes beyond the gags. No one even mentions Infinity Stones, and the fate of the universe, the planet, or even Asgard or Wakanda is not at stake.

There are no obligatory cameos by other heroes, like Falcon in the first Ant-Man (or Iron Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming, another relatively small-scale MCU excursion). After their mutual absence in Infinity War, I half expected Hawkeye to show up in Ant-Man’s new adventure, but he doesn’t, thank goodness.

There’s some talk about the epic airport battle in Germany from Captain America: Civil War, and Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, the neophyte Ant-Man, can’t help name-dropping “Cap.” In general, though, Ant-Man and the Wasp is less shackled to the rest of the MCU than any post-Avengers Marvel sequel — at least until the downbeat midcredits stinger.

There’s an antagonist called Ghost who is not out to exterminate or enslave, and in fact doesn’t particularly want to harm anyone (but is willing to). Laurence Fishburne shows up as an old partner-turned-rival of Michael Douglas’ Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, and turns out to be a more interesting character than you’d expect. A gang of petty thugs led by Walton Goggins supply modest levels of menace. It’s all extremely not extreme.

Even the target audience skews smaller — younger, I mean — than usual. The first Ant-Man had a couple of violent sci-fi deaths, some typical language and Michael Peña’s comic-relief motormouth Luis chattering about an early sexual experience. Ant-Man and the Wasp goes lighter in all these categories. It might be Marvel’s most kid-friendly movie. Imagine that.

I’m not ashamed to say that I most enjoyed Ant-Man when it felt like a sequel in spirit to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Ant-Man and the Wasp doubles down on that vibe and then some, not least because Scott’s defining relationship is not with Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne, now the Wasp, but with Scott’s adorable young daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who dotes on him as much as he on her.

That’s not to say the Wasp is a mere sidekick. On the contrary, you could say Ant-Man is her sidekick. Her character may be underwritten, but it’s her quest, not Scott’s, that propels the story, and he supports her rather than vice versa — not always willingly.

That the Wasp is a marquee co-star at all is a corrective of sorts, if a modest one. Marvel has knocked out 20 movies over the last 10 years, and until now every one has borne the name of a male solo hero or a male-dominated team.

The DC franchise has stumbled a lot trying to follow in Marvel’s footsteps, but they did beat Marvel to the punch in this respect with Wonder Woman. (Marvel’s first heroine-led film will be next year’s Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson. After years of cold feet, it seems Marvel execs are even allowing a Black Widow solo movie.)

The first Ant-Man movie technically had two Ant-Men, with Michael Douglas’ Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, passing the baton to Scott. Yet it somehow managed to be between Wasps, with the original, Hank’s wife Janet, lost in the quantum realm, and their daughter Hope pointlessly sidelined and forced to watch Scott suit up without her.

Now, Hope is allowed to spread her wings, which she has, along with wrist blasters, which is the kind of tech that Wasps get but Ant-Men don’t. Like many comic-book conceits, the only way to deal with this is to incredulously cross-examine it and then move on, since the real reason (wasps fly and sting and ants generally don’t) would hardly work as a diegetic or in-universe explanation.

Meanwhile, the movie exploits the tactical and comic possibilities of its Alice in Wonderland size-changing to greater effect than previous movies. After Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp is the only other recent Marvel movie with action set pieces that are visually unique and organically funny. (Some of the funnier gags involve technical glitches resulting in unpredictable size changes.)

For a movie about a divorced ex-con who is dodging parole-violation charges and whose ex-wife is remarried to a police officer, Ant-Man and the Wasp is remarkably genial. The former Mrs. Lang (Judy Greer) is nothing if not supportive of Scott, and her new husband (Bobby Cannavale) is almost unsettlingly amiable. With Cassie at the center, they’re almost one big happy family.

Scott’s parole officer (Randall Park) isn’t happy about the whole thing, but he’s not a jerk either. Even a sequence with Goggins and his thugs interrogating Luis is almost completely disarmed by Luis’ garrulous enthusiasm.

Marvel movies have often struggled to supply villains that matter. Ant-Man and the Wasp finds an unexpected solution: Perhaps villains that matter don’t matter as much as these movies think. I would say I’d like to see more superhero movies try something like this, but honestly, how likely is that?

147,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/why-nigeria-requires-5bn-water-sector-investments-to-meet-sdg-targets/,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vanguard,Why Nigeria requires $5bn water sector investments to meet SDG targets,"Kindly Share This Story:

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

148,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/south-african-sdg-hub-reports-on-national-implementation/,"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,South African SDG Hub Reports on National Implementation,"6 August 2018: The South African SDG Hub released a report on challenges and opportunities related to SDG implementation in the country. The report highlights a number of issues relevant to implementing the SDGs in South Africa, from partnerships and tools to the role of science, technology and innovation (STI).



The South African SDG Hub, housed at University of Pretoria, aims to connect South African policy makers with research and innovations for implementing the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Implementing the SDGs in South Africa: Challenges and Opportunities,’ presents in graphs the country’s progress against the indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report describes South Africa’s national planning, monitoring and evaluation system for the SDGs, which it says “is coherent and allows for alignment between planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation.” The report explains that Statistics South Africa monitors the SDGs prioritized by the national government, while the remaining Goals “will require social partners to assess relevance, provide data and agree on progress made.” The chapter also addresses promotion of citizen and multi-stakeholder engagements, expansion of youth involvement and knowledge infrastructure.

The report outlines the UN’s engagements with the Government of South Africa on the SDGs. The UN and the Government are discussing a Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) mission that will assess SDG alignment with South Africa’s Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF 2014-2019) and identify SDG Indicators Accelerators. The UN is supporting harmonization of interventions and civil society organization (CSO) accountability through convening 36 CSO alliances under an umbrella agenda, among other actions.

In addition, the UN Global Compact (UNGC) South Africa network has identified strategic action projects aligned with the SDGs, and is working to establish a national SDG institutional coordination mechanism at the provincial and local levels to drive SDG implementation throughout the country.

The report also considers the role of development partners and the role of researchers. It highlights “a large volume of research” relevant to SDG implementation, and identifies the coordination and dissemination of research on SDG implementation as a primary challenge. On STI, the report asserts that, despite considerable investments and advancement, equitable access to knowledge infrastructure remains a challenge, and South Africa is working to promote more equitable access in line with the principle of leave no one behind (LNOB).

In doing so, Switzerland created MONET 2030, an indicator system designed to statistically monitor implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a Swiss context. The expanded portal tracks 85 indicators across all 17 SDGs.



Of the 85 indicators monitored, MONET 2030 finds that 39 show a positive trend, 12 show no significant evolution, and 14 identify a reverse trend. These results were highlighted in Switzerland’s Voluntary National Review, which was presented to the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLFP).

MONET 2030 measures progress towards the 85 indicators by comparing observed trends to targeted trends. Targeted trends represent the desired direction of change, while observed trends reflect actual experience. Progress is assessed as positive if observed and targeted trends correspond, as negative if the observed and target trend differ, or as unchanged if the difference is greater than or less than 3%. The MONET 2030 system denotes these trends for each indicator on the front page of the site with symbolic arrows.

Users can explore each indicator in English, French or German by viewing descriptions, methodologies, reports, and graphs, which provide recent and historic data in downloadable formats. Each indicator also compares the Switzerland-defined target to its related international target, highlighting the fact that to achieve the 2030 Agenda, global goals must be assessed within a local context and addressed at the local level.

MONET 2030 is unique among countries’ online SDG portals in that it adapts an existing platform to the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to the Federal Statistical Office.

In a prior effort in SDG tracking, following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, Switzerland’s Federal Council established a commission to conduct a baseline assessment and gap analysis for the implementation of all 169 global SDG targets.

151,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/guide-facilitates-businesses-integration-of-sdgs-into-corporate-reporting/,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Guide Facilitates Businesses’ Integration of SDGs into Corporate Reporting,"1 August 2018: The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN Global Compact launched a publication that offers guidance to companies seeking to integrate the SDGs within their corporate sustainability reporting. The paper describes a process through which companies can prioritize SDG actions and impacts without “cherry-picking” Goals that they already positively contribute to, and highlights principles for effective, comprehensive reporting.

Titled, ‘Integrating the SDGs into Corporate Reporting: A Practical Guide,’ the document follows two papers launched in the past year by GRI and UN Global Compact, completing a three-part toolkit on enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs. The guide aims to help companies prioritize SDG targets for action and reporting, regardless of their size or scope, as well as assist businesses with measurement of progress. In doing so, the paper helps businesses move beyond “simply” mapping their activities to the SDGs.

Reporting is a strategic tool to engage stakeholders, support decision making, shape business strategy and attract investments.

The publication outlines a three-step process to: define priority SDG targets and impacts; set and measure objectives, and analyze performance; and “report, integrate and implement change.” Each step features three sub-components, each of which are supported by SDG examples and other entry points for action. The process explicitly avoids creating a new reporting framework. Instead, it builds on existing principles and guidelines, including GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Standards, UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as outputs from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Following these guidelines, the publication sets out a process of “principled prioritization” for the SDGs. The approach, the paper notes, includes consideration of two entry points: 1) risks to people and the environment; and 2) beneficial SDG-related products, services and investments. These entry points allow companies to address negative impacts from their operations or value chains and apply their knowledge, skills and capabilities in contribution to the SDGs. The guide highlights that the process further enables companies to align their strategies and resource allocations with their impacts and disclosures, as well as identify whether new actions or strategy alterations are needed.

The publication underscores that reporting is a strategic tool to engage stakeholders, support decision making, shape business strategy and attract investments, noting that it is “neither the start nor the end of a company’s sustainability strategy.” With the SDGs also catching the attention of investors, the paper emphasizes the strong business case for investing in opportunities that are aligned with the Goals. However, it warns that companies must avoid “SDG-washing” which the authors define as reporting positive contributions to the SDGs while ignoring important negative impacts. They highlight that a principled prioritization process is designed to help companies avoid “cherry-picking” Goals or targets and therefore avoid SDG-washing.

The paper was developed with expert input from Shift, technical support from PwC and financial support from the Government of Sweden, as part of a broader Action Platform on Reporting on the SDGs. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the other knowledge products available through the platform and its partners, and maps which tools can support each of the five steps of SDG engagement defined by the SDG Compass.

152,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-food-supply-chains-decent-work-and-sustainable-agriculture/,"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Food Supply Chains, Decent Work and Sustainable Agriculture","The SDGs’ interlinkages can be examined in a variety of ways, to assess how the achievement of one can support or hinder progress on others. In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

153,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-the-belt-and-road-initiative-and-chinas-investment-in-africa/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: The Belt and Road Initiative and China’s Investment in Africa,"With tensions high in the global community around trade policies and international relations, this week’s brief reviews some of the differences in countries’ approaches to investment abroad. Following recent headlines, it examines China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in tandem with cooperation in Africa, highlighting the implications for sustainable development on the continent.

Announced in 2013 with the promise of providing a “silk road for the 21st century,” the BRI consists primarily of state- and privately-financed infrastructure projects in developing countries. The Initiative has been met with both praise and skepticism.

In the Financial Times, Beijing Foreign Studies University’s Gu Bin says, the “spirit of the BRI reinforces the value of building a shared future,” highlighting key differences that distinguish it from the post-World War II Marshall Plan led by the US. However, Sean Kenji Starrs, City University of Hong Kong, responds by noting the BRI is “no selfless venture.” He cites debt, other aspects of neocolonialism and increasing homogeneity of Chinese academia as causes for concern (though these points are also contested).

The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development’s (ICTSD) July publication of Bridges Africa zooms in on China-Africa economic relations. The introductory article flags that some have questioned the “balance and quality” of the relationship from an African perspective, given China’s high and immediate demand for natural resources. It also notes recent data that show decreases since 2013-2014 in Chinese investment in Africa, China-Africa trade, and Chinese loans to Africa. However, Yunnan Chen identifies opportunities for promoting sustainable development, emphasizing not only renewable energy and transportation projects, but also the scope for technology transfer and diversification of sourcing.

The International Institute for Environment and Development’s (IIED) James Mayers examines the complex impact of Chinese investment in Africa, linking particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), in a “long read” titled, ‘Finding a Green Path for China and Africa?’. Some investments, Mayers says, “gobble up forest and woodland. Some bring huge benefits to African economies. Some do both.” The article offers an overview of the BRI and provides insight to a topic that often features perceptions that have been “assumed rather than really known.” Mayers identifies context-specific constraints to more sustainable timber production and processing, particularly in small-scale operations that “have traditionally worked under the radar of policy and legality.” A key gap, he notes, is connecting businesses to the remote areas and people where their investments often materialize, and breaking down stereotypes or prejudices across stakeholder groups.

IIED also produced a short film on the linkages between Chinese investment in Africa and the continent’s forests, which it emphasizes are increasingly being converted to agriculture or sent to China – the world’s “only reliable market” in the eyes of one interviewee. Darlindo Pechisso, National Directorate of Forests, Mozambique, notes that 90% of the country’s timber is exported to China. The article and film are part of a wider project supported by the UK on China-Africa Forest Governance.

Looking at trade more broadly through an agricultural lens, the fourth in a series of articles on Impakter asks whether achieving the SDGs is a “grassroots-up” or “global trade-down” endeavor. The article notes that at the local level, 45 million small farms in Africa produce the bulk of countries’ agricultural exports, and that trade links these smallholders to global food value chains. The authors, from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAO), also highlight large agribusinesses and multinationals, which they indicate as having a leading role, but will have to “substantially change” their business to contribute to the SDGs and minimize the negative impacts of their operations. A Devex Q&A on support to African entrepreneurs also notes the potential for agriculture and trade in Africa.

Following the recent BRICS Summit in South Africa, China’s President Xi Jinping signed a number of cooperation documents on the continent. An opinion piece on China Global Television Network (CGTN) by China’s ambassador to Somalia, Qin Jian, calls the BRI “win-win cooperation,” noting that the BRI “reaffirms China’s commitment to building an open economy, ensures free and inclusive trade, opposes all forms of protectionism.” Qin also says the BRI stands for enhancing international cooperation through strategies that feature the SDGs and African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The Brookings Institution’s Yun Sun compares China’s state-led approach in Africa to that of the US, which is “more willing to let companies and the market” lead commercial development. She notes that while US-China cooperation around Africa’s development has been “scarce,” there is increasing collaboration between Chinese and American companies, the latter of which appear to be beneficiaries of the BRI. General Electric (GE), she highlights, has worked in partnership with the state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) on an expanded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project model. Under such a model, partners work together on joint market development, fundraising and operation. However, the article closes by cautioning that BRI projects are “designed to absorb Chinese overcapacity,” noting that most foreign firms remain at a disadvantage in competing for them. Whether these projects are aligned with the ambitions of the SDGs is yet to be seen.

Implementing the SDGs requires financial flows to, at a minimum, remain consistent. The BRI represents a significant source of funding that can begin to bridge the well-documented finance gap. However, in the broader context of a trade war and retaliatory measures or increasing national self-interest, reductions in investment or the continuation of a business-as-usual approach risks leaving the environmental and social pillars of international development unaccounted for.

The publication titled, ‘The SDGs and Cities: International Human Mobility,’ provides an overview of cities’ various strategies, initiatives and efforts. It includes a practical tool with 13 possible lines of action to be implemented by local governments to deal with international human mobility from a human rights perspective, and emphasizes social participation and the systematic production of information.

The 13-part practical tool focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations.

The tool aims to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by facilitating, promoting and replicating implementation of local public policies aimed at helping migrants and refugees. It focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations, and aims to enhance and promote the exchange of experiences and best practices regarding international human mobility in LAC cities.

According to the report, almost 80% of Latin American population lives in cities. The study notes that the proportion of the immigrant population is higher in cities as migrants tend to settle in large urban areas. This causes difficulties for local authorities to implement policies for integrating new inhabitants, related to the lack of resources, services and technical capacity.

The Handbook describes 13 actions, relevant implementation strategies, reasons such actions are needed, indicators and targets associated with SDGs 10 (reduced inequalities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), 4 (quality education), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 5 (gender equality) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The actions include:

Guarantee access of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees to public policy-making processes (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.7);

Create a specific institution for caring for, receiving and integrating them (SDG targets 10.7, 16.6 and 16.b);

Provide training for local governments, focusing on rights (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7 and 16.b);

Develop anti-discriminatory campaigns that underscore “interculturality” for human and sustainable development (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.b);

Implement programmes that grant local identification and improve access to housing, health and education (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7, 11.1 and 16.9);

Complement curricula in schools and teacher training colleges with intercultural and bilingual education (SDG targets 4.1 and 10.7);

Develop skills improvement programmes (SDG targets 8.7, 8.8 and 10.7);

Implement programmes to care for women migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees that are victims of gender violence, and design strategies to raise awareness about this problem (SDG targets 5.1, 5.2, 10.7 and 16.1); and

Provide cultural mediators and interpreters for health and healthcare services (SDG targets 3.8 and 10.7).

Between 2000 and 2015, the number of international migrants worldwide increased from 173 million to 244 million. Around nine million international migrants live in LAC countries. International and regional organizations are advancing an agenda to promote safe migration and respect for migrants’ rights through the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which will be adopted in December 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco.

The Handbook was prepared in response to the global phenomenon of human mobility in urban areas.

The report is based on data from 79 countries, and finds that only 59% of domestic wastewater flow is collected and safely treated, and insufficient information is available for estimates of industrial wastewater treatment.



SDG target 6.3 sets out several objectives for improving water quality, including halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. An indicator for this target (6.3.1) measures “Proportion of wastewater safely treated,” through two sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater (SDG indicators 6.3.1a and 6.3.1b, respectively).

The report explains the methodology used to develop the global baseline on wastewater, and provides definitions of the terms used in the sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater. The authors caution that their findings probably represent the “upper limit” of current achievements, as the data come mostly from high-income and middle-income countries, and likely do not reflect the situation in many Asian and African countries.

The report draws attention to the contributions of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda.

The agencies highlight that many millions of people are at risk from contaminated water, and urge policy makers to regulate and enforce pollution control measures. They emphasize the need to better harmonize reporting on this issue through the application of common metrics.

The report also draws attention to the contribution of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, for example, in relation to drinking water, sanitation, and water-use efficiency (SDG targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, respectively), reduction of waterborne diseases (SDG target 3.3), water availability to boost food production (SDG target 2.4), nutrition (SDG target 2.2), and sustainable urbanization (SDG target 11.2).

The report recommends using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) codes to identify heavy polluters, pollution sources, and types of pollution as a basis for applying the “polluter pays” principle, especially with regard to industrial pollution. It also proposes an additional SDG indicator to capture the extent of wastewater reuse.

The wastewater baseline report was one of seven such studies launched by UN-Water at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

157,https://www.devex.com/news/challenges-facing-sdg-2030-deadline-for-safe-water-and-sanitation-93249,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Challenges facing SDG 2030 deadline for safe water and sanitation,"CANBERRA — Under goal six of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments are committed to targets for clean water and sanitation by 2030 — including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the lead up to a High-level Political Forum held at the United Nations in July, which discussed progress and challenges on a range of SDGs, including goal six, WaterAid Australia drew attention to the challenges of achieving the objective.

By analyzing the most recent data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which shows the percentage of the population in each nation with access to basic water and sanitation, WaterAid showed that the goal is unlikely to be achieved by 2030. The current rate of progress will see centuries before universal access to basic water and sanitation is achieved.

Further analysis of the source data, which shows progress achieved on a range of water and sanitation indicators between 2000 and 2015, suggests that only 21 countries are on target to achieve basic water and sanitation services for their entire population. Meanwhile, 68 countries have seen progress on targets decline since 2000.

The 'S word:' Is it time for the sanitation sector to reconsider subsidies? As donors and implementers grapple with how to deal with the world’s looming sanitation crisis, old debates over the use of subsidies are flaring up again. But experts told Devex of an emerging consensus that there is space for subsidies — if deployed in new and smarter ways.

Responding to environmental and political obstacles, as well as the challenges created in getting the last percentage of the population across the line for basic water and sanitation services, are barriers governments are being asked to urgently deal with, to ensure SDG 6 can be achieved.

Which countries are achieving targets?

Of the 21 countries that have achieved, or are on track to achieve, basic water and sanitation access for the entire population, only three countries classified as developed countries are expected to achieve both basic water and sanitation targets — Australia, Estonia, and Portugal.

There are also developing countries that have made major gains between 2000 and 2015, including Laos, Sri Lanka, Tokelau, and Vietnam. Based on the current rate of progress, these countries are expected to provide basic water and sanitation services for the entire population by 2030.

According to the data, Laos has been one of the biggest achievers. In 2000, less than half of the population had access to basic water and just over a quarter of the population had basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 80 percent of the population had access to basic water while almost three-quarters of the population had basic sanitation.

Based on its current rate of progress, Laos is projected to achieve national access to basic water and sanitation by 2024.

Vietnam is another success story according to the data. In 2000, almost a quarter of the population — most of them living in rural areas — were missing out on basic water access, with nearly half without basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 91 percent of the population had access to basic water, putting the country on track to achieve universal basic water access by 2025.

Now, just under 80 percent of the population has access to basic sanitation — with huge gains made in rural Vietnam. By 2028, the country is projected to achieve universal access based on current progress.

Which countries are in decline?

A concerning trend in the data is countries moving backward on access to basic water or sanitation for populations between 2000 and 2015. These include a wide range of nations: Bermuda, Jordan, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Slovenia, and Zimbabwe.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates.” — Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had enabled 36.7 percent of its population to access basic water and 18.7 percent basic sanitation. By 2015, this number had declined to 36.6 percent and 18.6 percent respectively — small declines by percentage but major barriers to achieving universal basic and water access by 2030.

Other countries started 2000 with a major percentage of their population having accessible water and sanitation, only to drop.

In 2000, Nieu, for example, was providing more than 99.2 percent of its population with access to basic water and 100 percent of its population with access to basic sanitation. Fifteen years later they had both declined — basic water coverage declined to 98.2 percent and basic sanitation to 97.8 percent.

In 2004, Nieu was hit by the worst cyclone on its record, Cyclone Heta, which is likely to have played a role in the decline of water and sanitation. This demonstrates the challenges of natural disasters, conflict, and more, in the ability to achieve the 2030 targets.

Where is progress slow?

For other countries, barriers come from two key challenges: Starting from a low base or slow progress in achieving the final percentage points.

Equatorial Guinea’s population coverage of basic water rose from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2015 — an average improvement of 0.05 percent each year. Based on this rate of progress, Equatorial Guinea will achieve national coverage for basic water by 3119.

The challenge for Equatorial Guinea is in rural areas. While water coverage for urban regions is dramatically improving — with total coverage expected to be reached by 2037 in urban areas — coverage is worsening in rural areas, dropping from 39.9 percent coverage in 2000 to 30.5 percent in 2015. For basic sanitation, the entire nation is moving backward.

Why you should care about 'systems' in WASH The focus in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector needs to shift from the number of pumps or latrines built to a more sustainable, systems-wide approach, according to many insiders. Enter Agenda for Change, a coalition of organizations that seek to demonstrate how this can be done through collective action.

Similarly, Eritrea has a long road ahead. Beginning in 2000, data shows just 16.8 percent of the nation had access to basic water and 7.5 percent access to basic sanitation. By 2015, these numbers had improved, increasing to 19.3 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. But this slow rate of improvement projects that basic water will be provided to the entire population by 2507 and basic sanitation by 2374.

For Vanuatu, the rate of progress on water will see the country just miss the 2030 deadline. Vanuatu is projected to achieve national coverage by 2031. Just over half the population had access to appropriate facilities for basic sanitation in 2015, but with an annual progress of 0.2 percent, the country is projected to achieve basic sanitation targets by 3468.

These three nations also face other challenges.

Equatorial Guinea faces political challenges under the dictatorship of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who seized control of the country in a 1979 military coup. Eritrea has faced conflict with neighboring countries, U.N. sanctions, and droughts. And Vanuatu faces the impact of natural disasters, with Cyclone Pam causing widespread devastation in 2015, as well as the high cost of delivering services to the Pacific region.

At the time the data was collected, Puerto Rico was struggling to provide basic services to the last 3 percent of its population, in both water and sanitation. In 2015, basic water coverage had increased from 97.1 percent to 97.1. Yet, because the annual rate of growth averaged 0.003 percent, Puerto Rico was predicted basic national water access by 2773, with basic sanitation predicted by 2443. The data does not take into account the impact of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, on basic water and sanitation availability.

Despite national basic water coverage, 1 percent of Germany’s population has no access to basic sanitation. The country’s slow rate of progress means universal coverage is projected by 3753.

Belgium too struggles with slow progress. While nearly the entire population has access to water now, national basic sanitation is projected to be achieved by 4817.

Addressing the challenges

Achieving universal basic water and sanitation services by 2030 are hampered by a range of local factors. Although projections show the challenging road ahead for water and sanitation, they do not factor in additional challenges — such as future natural disasters, conflicts, and economic crises — have in achieving universal access targets.

Top employers in water, sanitation, and hygiene: A primer 663 million people still don't have access to clean and safe water, and 1 in 3 people don't have a decent toilet. WASH sector NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, and private consultants are all crucial players in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6. Check out this Devex roundup of some of the biggest employers in WASH to find out if any are right for you.

With data at hand showing the gravity of the challenge, it is hoped that better practices might be developed, through planning and policy, to support universal access. By breaking the data down into in rural and urban coverage, it becomes evident where they exist: Commonly in rural areas.

At the conclusion of a High-level Political Forum, former President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council Marie Chatardová spoke on the challenges of water and sanitation coverage.

“We … held extensive discussions on the SDG 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on cities, 12 on sustainable consumption and production, 15 on life on land, and 17 on partnerships,” she said.

“We came up with many recommendations … Those include establishing a ‘blue fund’ to support design and implementation of transboundary water management for SDG 6.”

She highlighted the importance of partnering with the private sector and other new partners to achieve the goals. But whether the outcomes of the High-level Political Forum, including delivery of the proposed blue fund, will achieve significant changes in the projections is yet to be seen.

“For nations to be years off track in meeting the human right to water and sanitation is shocking,” said Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia, prior to the political forum.

“The meeting of ministers at HLPF must result in more than just words of encouragement because we have only 12 years left to keep the promise made to those living without clean water or a decent toilet. Governments must prioritise water, sanitation and hygiene — the basic building blocks of any stable and prosperous community — ensuring proper financing is put in place to build a more sustainable country today and for future generations,” he said.

WaterAid is calling on governments, donors, financial institutions, and the private sector to prioritize financing for water and sanitation and to integrate the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene into strategies for education, health, and nutrition programs globally.

Experts are calling for more investment into research and programs to tackle stigma and barriers surrounding issues of sanitation.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates,” Muller said.

With one child dying every two minutes from diarrhea caused by dirty water, poor sanitation, and bad hygiene, according to WaterAid, more than a quarter of million children will die each year basic water and sanitation targets are not met — a figure unacceptable to both Muller and the objectives of the SDGs.

It is a leading example of how local governance structures are helping to meet national and international development frameworks and priorities.

With the mission to revitalize, strengthen and position Navakavu to engage in opportunities for growth and prosperity for a transformed Fiji, the NRS is linked to the Fiji National Development Plan 2017-2021 (NDP) and the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 (SDGs). The NRS was officially launched by the Prime Minister of Fiji and President of UNFCCC COP 23 Honourable Josaia V Bainimarama on 6 June 2018, at the Novotel Conference Centre. In a statement supporting the NRS mission, he said:

“… [W]e recognize that there is immense opportunity in a growing Fijian economy, and we want to put the Yavusa o Navakavu in the best possible position to realize those opportunities… Today marks the beginning of your conference to launch the Navakavu Revitalization Plan from 2018-2022, a plan that builds upon the strategic blueprint laid out in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan….I applaud your community for coming together to determine how you can capitalize on all the great progress and all the new opportunity that has come to Fiji. Because a government alone can only do so much. It can create a favorable environment, but it is up to individuals to take advantage…]”

The five NRS Strategic Goals that link to the Fiji NDP and SDGs address, inter alia, employment, housing, education, health, land, and infrastructure. The NRS strategic goals show how national development plans (the NDP) as well as international development roadmaps (the SDGs) can be implemented at the local level in a way that reflects local needs and priorities.

The five NRS Strategic Goals address employment, housing, education, health, land and infrastructure.

The NRS launch coincided with the 21st Anniversary of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA), which is helping to meet the targets of the SDG on life below water (SDG 14), among others. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua o Navakavu with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In Navakavu, there is a local Committee comprised of family unit heads that has worked to increase awareness of the need for, and the implementation of, strategies for fisheries conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources in the area.

The paramount chief of Navakavu, the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni, and His Council have approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protection Area to platform its long-term plan of a Live Marine/Science Laboratory, which would serve as an initiative integrating conservation, education and tourism objectives. Community discussions are underway on this “Navakavu Reef to Ridge Initiative.” It covers an area of some 3.3 square km, which is equivalent to approximately 18% of the community fishing ground area of 18.5 square km.

Local efforts are also targeting youth to ensure longevity and the intergenerational reach of projects. On 29 June 2018, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the Chief Guest with the Navakavu Youth in commemorating the World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his Council joined the youth together with officials from the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry, FLMMA network and Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation (PIANGO).

The commemoration of the Navakavu Youth World Oceans Day is in line with the Goals under the Sustainable Development Goals, the Fiji National Development Plan, the Plan for the Yasana o Rewa, the Tikina o Suva and Goal 4 of the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022.

The children and youth replanted mangroves and native trees to celebrate the day and plans are in place to clean up rubbish from our land and our beaches and our ocean. The youth and children have taken leadership as custodians of our Ocean. They too feel this moral obligation, as we are all committed to this sacred responsibility.

Prior to 1991, the USSR and Iran shared control of the sea.

The five countries reached the deal, known as the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, on 12 August 2018 during the Caspian Sea Summit in Akta, Kazakhstan. One major point of contention leading up to the Summit was whether to define the Caspian Sea as a lake, meaning it would be divided equally between all five countries, or as a sea, which would then be governed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The agreement divides the seabed into territorial zones (as is the norm with a lake) and the surface as international water (as is the norm for an officially designated sea).

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the agreement will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

In a statement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the signing of the agreement, noting that it demonstrates the importance of regional cooperation and multilateralism for maintaining international peace and security. He highlighted the convention as a “significant step” towards easing regional tensions, and said it will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

The Summer Island Maldives resort is using the artificial reef made from hundreds of ceramic and concrete modules to build a new coral reef ecosystem.

An Australian industrial engineer with the Reef Design Lab began the project, using computer modeling to build a reef that resembled those found in the Maldives region. The 3D printing process took 24 hours. The molds were then cast in ceramic, which is similar to limestone rock, shipped to Maldives, filled with marine concrete, and assembled and submerged seven meters deep. The coral is now an integral part of the lagoon where the new coral reef ecosystem will be assembled.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits.

In total, 220 ceramic molds were filled with concrete and put together to create a larger reef. As the ceramic and concrete modules are white and therefore do not resemble the surrounding coral, the projects aims to encourage growth and provide a home for marine life, rather than replicate the reef’s natural aesthetic. Real coral fragments were transplanted onto the 3D printed reef, with the expectation that these corals will soon colonize the ceramic molds.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits. The 3D designs are open source for use by other researchers free of charge.

162,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-operation-finale,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Operation Finale’,"Ben Kingsley and Oscar Isaac square off in a post-WWII historical drama, as the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann and one of the Israeli agents who captured him in 1960.

It was the experience of reporting in Jerusalem on the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for The New Yorker that led the philosopher Hannah Arendt to coin her famous phrase “the banality of evil.”

Eichmann — by some reckonings Hitler’s deadliest lieutenant and the architect of the Holocaust, decorated by the Nazi regime with high honors, including the War Merit Cross and the Iron Cross — turned out under inspection to be, not a psychopath, an evil genius or a monster of hate, but something more inconceivable. Unreflective, unoriginal, uninsightful and plain uninteresting, he was, simply, an insipid functionary, a dull little man.

Accounts of the daring 1960 Israeli covert operation into Argentina, where Eichmann was living in Buenos Aires under the pseudonym Ricardo Klement, to spirit him to Jerusalem for trial describe a pathetic, timid soul who hardly dared to move without his captors’ orders.

Eichmann’s need to be told what to do anticipated his insistence at his trial that everything he had done in the service of the Third Reich was only him following orders. In defiance of the conventions of fiction and cinema, he was a figure one could despise, but hardly dread or fear in himself.

While I’m certain the chameleonic Ben Kingsley could play a baffling mediocrity like this, I’ve never seen him do it. He tends to go larger than life, not smaller. Whether playing heroes, monsters, mentors or ambiguous men, Kingsley is nearly always among the most vibrant figures on the screen.

Only as Itzhak Stern, Oskar Schindler’s Jewish accountant in Schindler’s List, has he ever withdrawn into any role I’ve seen. Kingsley’s Stern was insightful and less passive than he seemed, but he was a small man, dwarfed by circumstances, in the shadow of the flamboyant Schindler.

Eichmann and Stern are obviously antithetical roles, but a similar restraint might have served Kingsley well in evoking a figure of such legendary mundaneness.

But Operation Finale is Hollywood, so we get Kingsley in larger-than-life mode: formidable, masterful, commanding, self-possessed, as a movie villain worth his salt should be.

Directed by Chris Weitz and written by first-time screenwriter Matthew Orton, Operation Finale offers an efficient, sometimes gripping, fictionalized account of the discovery, capture and extraction of Eichmann.

In the process, it brings some earnest thought to moral questions about justice and violence, starting with a wrenching prologue in which an effort to bring a Nazi war criminal to justice goes appallingly wrong. Later, when Eichmann is located over a decade after the end of the war, it’s not immediately obvious that capturing him is still a high priority for Israel amid more pressing concerns — and the argument that carries the day there is not a moral one.

We also see signs of resurgent anti-Semitic sentiment in Argentina — sentiments with contemporary resonances that the film has little interest in exploring. (A Catholic priest joining in condemning Jews at a neo-Nazi meeting is one of the few religious references. An elderly Jewish mother scolding her grown son about answering the phone on Shabbat offers a glimpse into devout Orthodox Jewish observance.)

How historically grounded is this telling? That’s a complicated question, since the facts of the operation are in dispute, even among the participants. At least three agents published somewhat conflicting accounts — each maximizing the author’s own contributions.

The most colorful and popular version, and the one that inspired Operation Finale, is that of the man who physically grabbed Eichmann on the street: Mossad agent Peter Malkin, played in the film by Oscar Isaac.

In his book, Eichmann in My Hands, Malkin wrote about developing a clandestine relationship with the prisoner over the 10 days or so that they spent in a safe house. Disregarding mission rules, Malkin removed Eichmann’s blindfold and chatted with him, plying him with cigarettes and wine and even grooming and shaving him, ultimately inducing him to sign a document stating his willingness to be brought to Jerusalem for trial — or so Malkin said.

That narrative was bitterly disputed by expert interrogator Zvi Aharoni, played in the film by Michael Aronov. Aharoni, who initially identified Ricardo Klement as Eichmann, insisted that Eichmann signed the document for him without resistance and denied that Malkin even spoke German. (Malkin claimed to have communicated with Eichmann in a blend of broken German and Yiddish.)

Team leader Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll) never wrote an account, but he credited the least inaccurate version to spymaster Isser Harel (Llior Raz).

While I’m listing team members, Mélanie Laurent’s character, anesthesiologist Hanna Elian, is a composite of two real people: the real team’s lone female member, Yehudit Nesiahu, who helped to run the safe houses, and the male doctor, Yonah Eilan, whose task was to sedate Eichmann for transportation when necessary. Because Operation Finale is a Hollywood riff on Malkin’s account, Elian and Malkin have a romantic past.

The film accurately depicts Malkin as an amateur painter, passing time at the safe house creating works with Holocaust motifs. Perhaps he was a good storyteller, too. At any rate, it’s a good story.

Many details, including Eichmann grotesquely reciting the Shema — the affirmation of Jewish faith from Deuteronomy that is one of Judaism’s most important prayers — reflect Malkin’s account, though the context and meaning of these elements often shift in the retelling.

Yet where Malkin agreed with other accounts in depicting Eichmann as a feeble nonentity, Operation Finale makes the exchanges between the prisoner and his captors a powerhouse battle of wits, a cat-and-mouse game in which the identity of cat and mouse is an ever-shifting question.

In Malkin’s telling, Eichmann was so helpless that, after seating him on the toilet, his captors had to order him to relieve himself. In the film, when Eichmann asks permission to use toilet paper, it’s a passive-aggressive power move: He’s forcing his captors to take responsibility for his every action.

There’s more than an echo of The Silence of the Lambs in Isaac and Kingsley’s interactions. Eichmann is said to have, like Hannibal Lecter, intimidating powers of persuasion; his captors are warned that he convinced doomed prisoners to board Nazi death trains willingly. Like Lecter, Eichmann has a trick of drawing one in with seeming humanity before springing an appalling verbal assault wherever one is most vulnerable.

Though no untried trainee, Malkin has, like Clarice Starling, a secret trauma that Eichmann homes in on. The dynamic of quid pro quo versus not wanting Adolf Eichmann inside your head is very much the subtext of their exchanges.

This can make for compelling drama, especially when played with the intelligence and charisma that Isaac and Kingsley have in abundance. Yet in making Eichmann another darkly iconic Hollywood master of manipulation — alongside Lecter, De Niro’s Max Cady (Cape Fear), Russell Crowe’s Ben Wade (3:10 to Yuma) and Heath Ledger’s Joker — something of the moral truth of the Third Reich’s impersonal evil is lost.

Schindler’s List has been criticized for its depiction of Ralph Fiennes’ SS officer Amon Göth as a psychotic killer, which was far from typical of the Nazi machine. That portrayal at least has some basis in history.

Operation Finale isn’t a bad film, but it’s an unsatisfying one. It works on its own terms, but it lacks a sense of thematic resolution, a moment of truth. It tells a decent story well enough, but what does it want to say?

United Way / Centraide of SDG welcomes new operations manager Back to video “I do have experience volunteering in the community,” she said. “I volunteered for different non-profit agencies. I was also heavily involved with the Chamber of Commerce as a past vice-president and I have been on the board for five years.” Bingley said it was through those networking opportunities she became much more involved in the community and she felt she was missing another challenge. “I wanted to create a bigger impact in our community and truly help individuals out,” she said. “So that’s why I put my name forward (for the position).” Bingley said it was a big decision to make, but she was really excited to be working with the United Way and had some ideas about fundraising and how things could change within the organization.

Article content “I’m figuring it out, I’m figuring out the role,” she said. “Knowing the board will be the first step. Lori (Greer) set a great path and she has big, big shoes to fill. I am very grateful to come after her.” Bingley said she was also really excited to be working with campaign chair Angie Baker. “Angie has been on the board for a number of years so that will be very helpful,” she said. Bingley said one of the biggest challenges she can see in her new position is to get the younger generation interested in the community. “The millennials, just trying to get them volunteering, participating,” she said. “That seems to be the challenge.” Bingley said she was also hoping to reach out to seniors who might donate to the United Way while in the workforce, but tend to forget about the agency once retired. “There are a lot of workplace campaigns and then the individuals retire and we want to keep them in the United Way,” she said. “Those are the two ends of the spectrum we want to reach.” Bingley said it was important to put out the educational component of the agency, to remind people what the United Way does and the member agencies it supports. “A lot of people in our community don’t know what these agencies do,” she said. “I think it is important for us to education and once people fully know what the United Way brings, it’s going to be easier to get that generation involved.” Bingley said while she wants to explore different fundraising initiatives, it is still in the planning stages.

Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures

Article content Everywhere from Windsor, to Cornwall, to Thunder Bay, voters will be marking their “X” next to the name of their preferred mayoral candidates and local representatives. But, there’s another, often overlooked elected office voters will have the opportunity to decide on. And, given the controversy surrounding school closures and sexual health education over the past year, the role of school board trustee may be getting more attention from voters come election day. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures Back to video Trustees represent the interests of their constituents on any of the four publicly funded school boards. They are not involved in the day-to-day aspect of running and managing a school, but do work heavily with the province, parents, educators, and students on many important matters that affect our communities. Voters in Cornwall won’t have much of a say in who their trustees are, for better or worse. All incumbents on the English public, English Catholic, French public, and French Catholic boards who represent Cornwall were acclaimed. In fact, all of the French-speaking trustees across Cornwall and SDG are acclaimed.

Article content However, in some rural communities, the race for trustee for the Upper Canada District School Board could be more high profile than most years. In Stormont and Glengarry, there will be an exciting three-way race. The incumbent will not be seeking re-election, leaving the job open. The Mayor of South Stormont, Jim Bancroft, who will be leaving the council table this fall, hopes to continuing serving with the school board. “I feel comfortable that it’s time to move on,” said Bancroft. “I hope the community will recognize that I care about the community, I believe our schools need to be represented as strong as we can.” He will be challenged by former student trustee Marshal Wilson. Wilson was involved with the board through the school closure process, which he credits as the main reason for why he became so intimately involved in the role. “The one thing that differentiates me, in my mind and with most people I talk to, is the type of experience I have,” said Wilson. “There’s no real learning curve for me. I’m already familiar with how the board works.” Also in the running in Stormont and Glengarry is John Danaher. Danaher is a retired principal, and has been familiar with the workings of the UCDSB for most of his life. He also has nine grandchildren currently in school. “Unfortunately education is very political,” said Danaher. “I think with the school closures, and I think with what’s coming forth with the change of [Provincial] government, if there are changes there, we have to be ready to work with them.”

Article content English public school voters in North Dundas and South Dundas will also have a choice to make come election day. Jeremy Armer, who could not be reached for comment at the time of publication, will be challenged by retired local principal Larry Berry. “I threw my name in because I’d like to be involved in education, I’m positive towards the board, I’m not axe-grinding. It’s a positive bid to become the trustee,” said Berry. Berry wanted to see someone become a staunch supporter of the smaller, rural schools in his district. He also wants to see boards support regular classroom teachers better, and encourage more physical activity among students, something he strongly supported during his time as an educator. Dundas voters (North and South) will also have the opportunity to elect a trustee to the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario, along with voters in Stormont who they share a district with. Incumbent Karen McAllister will be running against Donna Neilsen.

166,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

The programme is the 8th United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).

One of the targets of Goal 8 is to promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services.

The signing agreement was attended by Erkki Nghimtina, the Minister of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment Creation; Guy Ryder, the Director-General of the ILO; representatives from UN, Employers and Workers’ Unions.

“Decent Work is about better prospects for personal development, social integration and freedom of expression. It is about Freedom of workers to organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men,” Rachel Odede, UN Resident Coordinator said at the signing agreement.

Ryder noted that to realise the effective implementation of the programme, they will build up a steering committee.

This committee will see to it that Namibia achieves full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value, he added.","The government and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) inked an agreement on the Decent Agreement Country Programme, which will promote fair income, security in the workplace and social production for families.

Mr Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, the Minister of Health, has warned that Ghana risked not achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Three, if access to Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Rights of People with Disabilities (PWDs), were overlooked.

Mr Agyeman-Manu, whose address was read on his behalf at a stakeholder’s forum on Improving Universal Access to SHR and Rights of PWDs, called for a conscious effort to target the numerous barriers that confronted these groups of persons in order to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.

He also called on Civil Society Organisations and all other health partners to intensify their advocacies for the review of the Disability Act, Act 715 of 2006, to clearly spell out the SRH and Rights for PWDs, and to compel service providers to recognize these groups as the beneficiaries of Rights to the services.

He mentioned that gaps and barriers, such as physical, educational, economical and communication continue to exist, affecting over 50 per cent of PWDs.

He said access to specific health services, including cancer screening and Family Planning were abysmal among this group of people, leading to increased morbidity and preventable deaths.

The forum, which was organised by the Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights (ARHR), in partnership with the French Embassy in Accra, was therefore to set the stage for a national dialogue, to come up with a comprehensive strategic policy guidelines for promoting the sexual Rights of PWDs.

Mr Agyeman-Manu explained that the SDG-3, had specific targets to ensure access to SRH care and UHC, stressing that, “Ghana will not realise its SDG-3 target if SRH needs of PWDs are not adequately addressed through a robust financial mechanism and an effective Primary Health Care System”.

He said such a move would facilitate the increased access covering the delivery of health care for these and other marginalized groups.

He also pointed out that although the country was a signatory to a number of International Conventions on Disability Rights, and had its own internal Constitutional and legal frameworks, as well as the Persons with Disability Act, 2006 Act 715, PWDs continue to be marginalised and abused by society.

Mr Agyeman-Manu said PWDs, continued to experience stigmatization and deprivation of their SRH and Rights, which prevented their effective progress in society and limit their full participation in mainstream activities on equal basis with others.

Studies, he said, had revealed that in Ghana, PWDs, particularly the hearing and visually impaired, as well as the physically challenged, were increasingly vulnerable to abuses such as rape, defilement, sexual harassment and assault, and also lacked access to SRH information services.

They were also often abused by health service providers and institutions of care, who failed to provide them with SRH information to enable them to make informed and independent decisions of their own, he said.

He said the government however recognised the critical role of the health system to achieving national development, hence its vision to ensure that the rights to good health for all Ghanaians would be guaranteed through a systemic health sector with sustainable capacity to deliver affordable, equitable and easily assessable service to all.

The Health Minister said to realise this, the government hoped to expand health promotion locally, scale up disease prevention strategies and improve access to curative and emergency services through vigorous human resource and health infrastructure development, and strengthening of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

These strategies would ensure that Primary Health Care (PHC) was available to all citizens, taking into consideration the findings from the Household and Facility Care study.

He also commended the efforts of the ARHRs, the French Embassy and other partners, for organizing the forum, and pledged the Ministry’s readiness to adopt the recommendations.

This would form relevant decision making in the health sector and contribute to the SRH needs of PWDs, and collectively strengthen its collaboration with all stakeholders to improve these needs.”

Ms Vicky Okine, the Executive Director, ARHR, said the forum was to explore effective ways to address the present gaps and remove the various barriers, including cultural, religious, attitudinal and infrastructural obstacles.

A study on stigma-related issues affecting PWDs in accessing SHR, revealed that it was a serious setback towards the interventions being made to improve the health rights and needs of these group.

It called for the strict enforcement of legislation to improve unfriendly facilities such as toilets, and also hospital environment, to aid their movements, ensure privacy and confidentiality of the private information of PWDs in order to boost their confidence in health service delivery.

It also requested for the development of a comprehensive public advocacy and education, improvement in the cost of SRH services to make them affordable to PWDs, and also that such information be made inclusive.

The participants called for the generation of desegregated data on PWD’s to facilitate targeted interventions and services.

Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

The project reports on individual and aggregate governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law; and control of corruption. The indicator data set is updated yearly.



In an FAQ on the WGI website, the project notes that in order to infer trends and identify changes over time, users must explore the underlying data, which is publicly available and can be downloaded from the website.

The WGI defines governance as the “traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised,” including the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced, government capacity to formulate and implement sound policies and respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions. The WGI provides measures for each of these dimensions of governance.

On voice and accountability, for instance, the WGI measure reflects the perceptions of the extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting their government as well as measures on freedom of association, freedom of expression and a free media. Rule of law measures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, particularly as they relate to contract enforcement, property rights, the police and courts and the likelihood of crime and violence.

Users can access the WGI’s updated interactive data access tool to select graphs, data, time series and country views. The time series view, for instance, allows users to view each indicator score between 1996 to 2017 to see changes over time. Users can also display any of the six aggregate WGI measures as a world map and move over the map to identify countries’ aggregate WGI indicator. Similarly, users can view any two of the six aggregate WGO measures on two world maps.

173,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/kofi-annan-and-the-transition-to-sustainable-development-goals/,"Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Kofi Annan and the Transition to Sustainable Development Goals,"As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006. His achievements helped set the stage for the set of 17 universal sustainable development goals and 169 targets we have today. This brief looks at the SDG era that Annan helped usher in vis-à-vis his efforts to set and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as his vision for exceeding their ambition.

A proponent of people pushing their governments to act, Annan established the UN Millennium Campaign with an aim “to mobilize the world around the MDGs” and “rally all people” to make poverty history. Having founded the precursor to the SDG Action Campaign and collective efforts such as the upcoming Global Goals Week, Annan’s memory and work continue to live on.

A “committed internationalist,” Annan’s self-described greatest achievement was the MDGs, the first set of global targets to improve human development and ensure social well-being. Although the Millennium Declaration was signed by all 189 UN Member States in 2000, Annan convened a group of experts to ensure the Declaration led to action, tasking them with crafting what became the eight MDGs. The effort received criticism for being non-inclusive and yet another attempt by developed countries to decide “what was best for the rest of the world.” It reflects the opinion that Annan’s leadership style was “all general and no secretary.” But the MDGs offered a focus for development efforts and provided proof of concept that, when financial institutions, government aid agencies and other donors use a single framework to channel their efforts and guide action on shared objectives, targeted progress can be achieved.

Skeptics and globalists alike have questioned whether accelerating global progress on goal areas such as poverty reduction, health and education can be attributed to the MDGs. For example, China’s rapid economic growth is often credited with helping the world achieve the first MDG target on halving extreme poverty, but China is said to have paid “no attention” to the framework. Conversely, Africa’s increased growth rates, although uneven within and between countries, is often attributed to donor efforts and other MDG-aligned investments. Regardless of shortcomings on the goal-setting process, the Secretary-General’s personal style, or difficulties attributing improved well-being to the MDGs, Annan’s work helped set a guiding vision that articulated a world for which society should strive.

Always Forward-thinking

Drafted in 2000, the MDGs as we know them today effectively came into prominence during the 2002 UN International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD), called for by Kofi Annan and held in Monterrey, Mexico. In part due to Annan’s collaborating with an “unusually wide” set of actors, the summit resulted in the setting of a target whereby developed countries would contribute 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries. At the summit, Annan highlighted an increasing interdependence between rich and poor, stating, “we live in one world, not two… no one in this world can be comfortable or safe while so many are suffering and deprived.”

But Annan was not merely satisfied with commitments to increase aid. Prior to the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland he emphasized that “responsibility flows both ways” and “rich and poor alike must do their part.” This thinking has helped to shift discussions towards overcoming the North-South divide, and towards bringing high-income countries into the development agenda as more than just providers of finance. This convergence of countries working together towards a “shared destiny” is a key pillar of the 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015.

Ever forward-looking, a 2002 address by Annan framed sustainable development not as a burden or lifestyle reduction for developed nations, but as an opportunity that could “build markets and create jobs” – an opportunity that was quantified nearly 15 years later at more than US$12 trillion. Annan’s understanding of this opportunity, and that it would require collaborative efforts by diverse actors, is reflected in his 1999 proposal for and the subsequent launch of the UN Global Compact.

Looking Back to Look Ahead

Comprehending the scope and complexity of the SDGs can be aided by taking a look into the past. Returning to China’s experiences, development experts know which sectors in China grew fastest, who in the country benefitted, and what the consequences for the planet have been. We understand the gaps left by the MDGs and remaining challenges, such as on integrating environmental targets, ensuring action by all, and including good governance. We recognize that these issues, similar to economic growth and other standalone SDGs, can serve as launchpads for the others, and that progress in some areas may be pursued in ways that negate gains elsewhere.

Like the MDGs, the SDGs do not have an implementation guide, a project budget or an organizational chart that maps out responsibilities. The framework does, however, provide a common language for actors from every sector of society and region of the world to come together on shared challenges. In 2013, Brookings’ John McArthur penned an article on what the MDGs had accomplished, noting that previously, “there was no common framework for promoting global development.” The need to fill such a gap also speaks to the impetus behind the SDGs. At the turn of the millennium, rich countries were looking inward amidst a civil society backlash against globalization, with major multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund facing protests in the streets.

Society’s Next Steps and Annan’s Mark on the Transition to SDGs

A Financial Times article acknowledges that Annan’s “trademark optimism does sometimes seem misplaced in our turbulent times.” However, such optimism, as on display in his 2010 Der Spiegel Q&A, is a prerequisite to tackling the ambitious sustainable development agenda toward which global society has agreed to strive. Even if laggards remain, Annan noted in March 2017 that “the rest of the world will continue.” As demonstrated by the global response to the US announcing its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, Kofi was right.

Annan also noted in Der Spiegel that building on lessons from the MDG era requires addressing root causes of key problems such as poverty, energy supply and climate change. With the SDGs’ ambition to “get to zero” on poverty and hunger, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the AAAA, the 2015 agreements represent a “triumph for multilateralism” that still guides Member State actions, even if some are retreating. Complemented by initiatives such as Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), which launched in 2011 and fed into the 2015 agreements, processes that Annan helped convene will continue to support the tackling of root causes. It is these root causes—ranging from gender and socioeconomic inequality to economic instability or marginalization to policy incoherence and siloed decision-making—that threaten the achievement of shared societal objectives.

Annan highlights a key lesson of the MDG era in the foreword of a 2015 paper: that the world’s challenges “cannot be achieved in isolation.” At a side event during the 2015 UN Summit to adopt the SDGs, Carlos Lopes described the need to move away from a “cappuccino approach” to development in which economic growth serves as the espresso base. Indeed, moving from MDGs to universal SDGs requires an integrated approach by all countries that cuts across economic, social and environmental pillars.

It is well-known that the SDGs demand action across the whole-of-society, supported by a wide range of means of implementation, including trade, technology transfer, data, capacity building and finance. Highlighting the importance of data to ending malnutrition in Africa, Annan continued to foster and promote the development of new tools that facilitate integrated SDG implementation and shift development paradigms. Similarly, on finance, mobilizing the private sector and “shifting the trillions” requires actors to be aligned with the spirit and principles of the 2030 Agenda. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI), launched in 2006 with Annan’s backing, offer a ready-made system to align institutional investors with the SDGs.

As one article reflected after Annan’s passing in August, if you care about the SDGs, then Kofi Annan “has played an important role in your work.” As members of the global community convene in New York for the 73rd UN General Assembly and largest-ever Global Goals Week, Annan’s legacy will be present in the ideals, spirit and foundational tools that are driving us towards the world we need.","As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006.

The EIE is a tool designed to give cities easy access to climate-relevant data so they can make evidence-based decisions about the environment. Currently in beta testing, the EIE is founded on the idea that “data and technologies can help accelerate the actions, industries and investments that enable the world’s transition to low-carbon future.”

The EIE uses information commonly found in Google Maps, such as building footprints, building typologies, street-level imagery and historical data, and aggregates this information to a city scale. Using this information, along with additional datasets, the EIE employs standardized methods to calculate information related to climate change.

Data are currently available for five pilot cities: Buenos Aires (Argentina), Melbourne (Australia), Victoria (Canada), Mountain View (US) and Pittsburgh (US). Data for each of these cities are organized in three categories: building emissions, transportation emissions and energy offset potential. Within each of these categories are supplementary indicators that were developed in collaboration with the GCoM, who helped Google connect with cities around the world to understand what data they required to reduce their emissions.

By introducing solar power onto flat roofs, the city of Victoria could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 7,660 vehicles off the road for a year.

Within the building emissions category, users can explore estimated carbon emissions by residential and non-residential buildings. Beyond displaying this information in a map, the EIE also provides suggested actions for reducing emissions, such as lighting upgrades and rooftop solar power, and calculates the potential impacts of these investments. This potential can be further explored in the energy offset potential category. In the case of Victoria, for example, the EIE estimates that by introducing solar power onto flat roofs, the city could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 7,660 vehicles off the road for a year, or growing 929,000 seedlings over 10 years.

Under the transportation emissions category, users can view the estimated emissions produced by mode of transport and the differences between in-bound and out-bound traffic. For cities interested in reducing their transportation emissions, the EIE provides links to implementing electric vehicle charging stations or introducing a car-free downtown. All the data are also available for download in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, including the metadata for the indicator.

By providing all this information in an online platform, the EIE aims to bring “data analytics to conversations about renewable energy.” While EIE has brought this information to fruition in five cities, Google plans on launching similar datasets for thousands of cities and towns around the world.

In the world of social enterprise and impact investing, perhaps the most universally accepted guide is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Introduced in 2015, the 17 inter-connected goals now form an organizing principle for many entrepreneurs, as well as investors.

At the same time, achieving those goals is going to cost trillions, literally, and won’t happen without heavy participation by the private sector. And to monitor and track how successful all that activity is, you also need consistent benchmarks for measuring and comparing just how all those companies are doing.

That’s where the World Benchmarking Alliance comes in. Recently announced at the United Nations General Assembly, it will develop free, publicly available benchmarks which will rank companies on their contributions to achieving the SDGs. With that in hand, everyone from consumers and investors to governments will have a comprehensive tool for deciding where to spend their money, allocate their investments or direct their policy and advocacy efforts.

Ultimately, the goal is to clarify what society expects from business and how best companies can meet those expectations. “Benchmark methodologies translate societal expectations into metrics, providing companies with a clear path forward,” says Mark Wilson, group chief executive of Aviva, a multinational insurance company and one of the members of the Alliance. Others include the nonprofit Index Initiative and the United Nations Foundation. Funding is also coming from the governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Denmark.

Plus, the ranking could inspire a healthy competition among businesses and create a market that rewards corporate leadership. “CEOS, especially in the U.S., are a competitive bunch of people,” says Wilson. “You want to appeal to that competitive spirit, so they and their shareholders take sustainability seriously.”

Of course, pinpointing all the important factors that need to be taken into account involves a lengthy process—consulting with people in government, academia, sustainability and business. The announcement was preceded by a year of consultations with more than 10,000 experts.

Some examples of factors in various benchmarks: For the SDG category of food and agriculture, they would include whether companies are producing food in an environmentally friendly way and ensuring acceptable livelihoods for farmers. For climate and energy, they would show to what extent companies in high carbon-emitting industries are contributing to the Paris Agreement.

The aim is to develop all the benchmarks by 2023 to assess the world’s largest 2,000 companies. The first crop, due to be published in 2020, will address food and agriculture, climate and energy digital inclusion and gender equality and empowerment.

Regulators are also important in this equation, says Wilson. That’s because their prevalent short-term thinking means they don’t generally take into account long-term risks. Thus they might introduce, say, prohibitively high capital charges that penalize investments in wind farms and, as a result, discourage sustainability efforts. So there also will be benchmarks for regulators globally. “To move the needle on a lot of problems in society, we also need to rate the regulators,” says Wilson.

This isn’t the only relevant measurement methodology out there. But, the goal is for the WBA to be all-encompassing, accurate and independent. Says a press release, “The WBA is also expected to play a role in helping to leverage and harmonize the incoming wave of SDG-related monitoring initiatives that are currently being developed.”","And to monitor and track how successful all that activity is, you also need consistent benchmarks for measuring and comparing just how all those companies are doing.

The signing follows agreement between the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development and the Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) on the partnership programme. The two agreed to develop the programme at the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, which took place in Malta.

The five-year PEUMP has a holistic, multi-sector approach to marine resources and aims to contribute to the region’s environmental, economic and social development. The programme will focus on four key areas. First, the PEUMP will support sound coastal and ocean governance with a focus on biodiversity protection and sustainable fisheries and marine resource use. Second, the programme will use a rights-based approach to encourage participation of men, women and youth in decision making, and mainstream gender equality and human rights. Third, PEUMP will mainstream climate change and environmental issues. Finally, the programme will strengthen regional, national, sub-national and local capacity to deliver sustainable fisheries management and sound ocean governance through education, training and research.

Health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.

SPC Director General, Colin Tukuitonga stressed that the “health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.” He said the programme aligns with Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ vision of a ‘Blue Pacific’ and will help to ensure that Pacific communities can sustainably manage and conserve their ocean resources. Jean-Louis Ville, Head of Unit for East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific at the European Commission Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development, recognized the essential role of oceans in “ensuring food, livelihoods, biodiversity and climate resilience” but noted that the world’s oceans face increasing threats from unsustainable management practices and the negative effects of climate change. He said the EU-Pacific partnership will address such threats and support sustainable management of the Pacific’s marine resources.

The EU will provide €35 million for the programme, with an additional €10 million contribution from the Government of Sweden. [SPC Press Release] [EU Press Release]","5 September 2018: The Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Pacific Community (SPC), the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and The University of the South Pacific (USP) have signed an agreement with the EU to promote sustainable ocean management in the Pacific region.

This edition of “the magazine of the United Nations” focuses on the SDGs, and examines actions the UN has taken in its “lead role in advancing the 2030 Agenda.”

The articles cover topics that do not always feature prominently when discussing SDG implementation, such as disarmament and sexual violence. Pramila Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, highlights gender-based violence, which she describes as the “missing dimension” of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Patten links sexual violence to a human rights-based approach and the “leave no one behind” principle. She notes that “when war erupts, and the threat of rape at gunpoint becomes a pervasive terror,” women are unable to access fields, marketplaces and water points, and that girls are unable to attend school. Patten further highlights the disproportionate economic and health impacts of war on women, connecting to the majority of the SDGs. She also flags the importance of time: whereas men can invest hours in work, education or civic engagement, women—especially in developing countries—are often burdened with unpaid labor such as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Patten closes by calling on countries to legislate gender equality not only as a moral and social justice imperative, but also a smart economic choice.

Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, discusses the nexus between disarmament, arms control and development, outlining the linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and noting that the issue and its connection to development are not new. She references Article 26 of the UN Charter and points readers to the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament launched on 24 May 2018, which aims to take the issue out of its “narrow, isolated security lens.” Nakamitsu stresses the importance of disarmament to achieving SDG targets 16.1 (reduce all forms of violence and related death rates) and 16.a (develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions), and flags that disarmament is explicitly recognized in SDG target 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows). She also draws linkages to Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), (5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed follows by arguing that success on the SDGs will be “measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind.” Doing so, she notes, entails providing a voice and platform for meaningful participation and engagement, particularly by the most marginalized and vulnerable. To make this a reality, Mohammed calls for six elements to be put in place, including: making the SDGs better known in society; investing in more transparent and accountable institutions; creating appropriate spaces for young people and fostering their ideas and leadership potential; and connecting overlapping agendas.

Additional articles cover sexual health and reproductive rights, rule of law and sustainable human settlements, among other topics. The authors are:

NEW YORK — Too much of the data available to track the world’s progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is outdated, said Claire Melamed, executive director of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.

“Some of this data we're using to monitor progress on SDGs were collected before the SDGs were even agreed on, and in a world of satellites and mobile phones it’s insane we’re in that position,” Melamed said in an interview ahead of her talk at an event called We the Future at Global Goals Week in New York.

While it may not be possible to know what is happening in real time, people should be able to get a sense of progress on the SDGs week after week, or at least month after month, she said.

“It’s about working with governments to see which of the indicators they’ve prioritized they would like more up-to-date data on and then starting to put together the partnerships that will help to deliver that,” she said.

Timeliness is just one half of the problem; the other is comprehensiveness, Melamed said.

Figures such as the estimated 263 million children out of school point to another major problem around data for the SDGs, which is that granular data about individuals is often nonexistent.

“We don’t get that number from actually counting children,” Melamed said. “We get that from counting a few children and estimating up from that to what we think the global figure is.”

One consequence of that system is that it fails to capture any additional information about the actual people the SDGs are meant to serve — in other words, the stories behind the data. People most in need are also the most likely to be absent from these headline figures.

“We know very little, not as much as we need to, about the actual children who are out of school. We don’t know how many of them are out of school because they’re looking after a sibling or they’ve been a victim of child marriage,” Melamed said.

Melamed was part of a major announcement this week on Data to End Hunger, the largest ever financial commitment on data for development, a partnership supported by donors from the United States, Germany, and Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and other partners, to produce data for agricultural development.

“Agriculture is key to achieving so many of the SDGs,” she said. “If we want to reduce poverty, if we want to reduce hunger, if we want to increase the number of jobs, all of those things depend on agriculture in the world’s poorest countries.”

The partnership comes in the wake of a report on food security and nutrition demonstrating how levels of hunger have risen for three consecutive years.

The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data consistently hears from governments that one of the things they need to solve this problem is better data, Melamed said. This new initiative seeks to use the power of data to boost the productivity of 500 million smallholder farmers across 50 countries by 2030, by working with existing government systems rather than launching a new database.

New technologies “make things faster and cheaper and give us the 3D picture of societies we’ve never been able to have before,” Melamed said.

Technologies work best when they are built on solid systems: A good census bureau, a civil registration system, a consistent household survey program, and the other basic building blocks of data all governments need.

Melamed pointed to this partnership as an example of growing awareness among donors that investment in basic data systems can reap rewards in many different ways.

“The challenge for all of us is, while we’re interested in having the right numbers now, we actually all know in the long run what we need is not the right numbers now, today … but the right systems to make sure we get the right numbers today and tomorrow and next week,” she said.

The projects were based on the Global Compact’s Tenth Principle (anti-corruption) and on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), with a focus on SDG target 16.5 to “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.”Through the projects, which were supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative Second Funding Round, businesses, governments and civil society worked to increase compliance standards across Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria.

In Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria, the project connected various stakeholders to discuss challenges and opportunities, as well as to identify collective efforts to combat corruption, increase transparency, and create an enabling environment for businesses and flourishing societies. The UNGC’s four Local Networks organized workshops that engaged 900 participants, helping them develop resources to improve anti-corruption compliance among business participants and establish a strategy to ensure ongoing commitment towards anti-corruption.

In Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Junior Business Association, UNGC created the Integrity Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder, business-led group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) committed to tackling corruption. SMEs that joined the Initiative signed a ten-step Integrity Pledge and were trained on various aspects of anti-corruption compliance. The project trained personnel from over 400 SMEs and developed guidance materials for SMEs on topics including transparency in customs, public procurement, code of conduct, and internal controls, along with an online support desk.

To mark the completion of the projects, UNGC released the second edition of its publication titled, ‘Promoting Anti-Corruption Collective Action through Global Compact Local Networks.’

Also to increase government transparency, improve accountability, and strengthen citizen engagement as well as government responsiveness, on 19 July 2018 the World Bank and development partners launched the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The US$12 million Fund was created with Agence Française de Développement, the Department for International Development UK, and Global Affairs Canada.

In countries and sub-nationals that participate in the OGP, the MDTF will support implementation of open government reforms, an inclusive and participatory dialogue and decision-making process, and build an evidence base on the impact of open government reforms. The first awards were given to nine civil society organizations to facilitate the participatory process of developing OGP Action Plans in five countries and four sub-nationals.

According to UNEP, 13 million tonnes of plastic trash find their way into the oceans each year, posing threats to marine animals and plants and human health. Consequently, UNEP describes marine plastic pollution as “one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time.”

Schoolchildren are encouraged to talk to politicians about how they can reduce single-use plastic in their communities.

To support the Challenge, UNEP has developed a ‘Back to School Education Pack’ that aims to provide an overview of marine plastic pollution and showcase examples of solutions that schools and communities can implement to reduce and eliminate single-use plastic. The pack includes an animation video produced by Kurzgesagt that tells the story of how humans discovered how to make plastic and how the creation of plastic has created problems. The video underscores that humans have the power to tackle marine plastic pollution, including through the Back to School Plastic Challenge.

Suggested actions include to:

ask schools to stop using single-use plastic items in school lunches and the cafeteria;

avoid plastic items when buying back-to-school supplies;

avoid using plastic for wrapping lunch items and instead buy a lunch box or use paper;

work with your school to find ways your school can reduce its plastic footprint;

participate in a beach clean up with fellow students;

talk to politicians about how they can reduce single-use plastic in your community; and

educate friends and family about marine plastic pollution.

UNEP encourages schools to report on their actions and share their stories with UNEP’s Clean Seas team to be considered for the ‘Clean Seas Back to School Awards.’ The Agency is accepting entries to the challenge until 10 January 2019.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

184,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-surveys-e-government-practices-worldwide-for-sdg-achievement/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Surveys E-Government Practices Worldwide for SDG Achievement,"19 July 2018: The tenth edition of the UN E-Government Survey, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), concludes that while e-government began with bringing services online, the future will be about the power of digital government to leverage societal innovation and resilience, and to transform governance to better achieve the SDGs.



The survey is the “only global report” that assesses e-government development status of all UN Member States, according to the authors. It measures e-government effectiveness in the delivery of public services, and aims to enable countries to learn from each other, identify areas of strength and challenges in e-government and shape their policies and strategies in this area.

The 2018 edition of the survey titled, ‘Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies,’ seeks to provide analysis and evidence to “further utilize the potential of e-government” to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The survey examines: the preconditions and the enabling environment for mobilizing e-government to build resilient societies; e-resilience and building the resilience of e-government; global trends in e-government; regional development and country groupings performance; improving cities resilience and sustainability through e-government assessment; and fast-evolving technologies in e-government.

Among its conclusions, the survey notes that since 2014, all 193 UN Member States have been delivering some form of online presence. According to the 2018 E-Government Development Index (EGDI) − a composite index which assesses e-government development at the national level, including the provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human capacity − Denmark, Australia and the Republic of Korea lead the world in providing government services and information through the internet, followed by the UK, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France and Japan. The survey also presents the findings of a pilot study on applying e-governance to local governments in 40 municipalities around the world. It lists as the top cities: Moscow, Russian Federation; Cape Town, South Africa; Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rome, Italy; and Warsaw, Poland. The EGDI is presented bi-annually by DESA.

Per the survey, since 2012, there is a “steady increase” in the number of country websites with information about specific programmes benefiting women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous people, and people living in poverty. The report indicates that a growing number of countries provides targeted online services to vulnerable groups: 86% in the Americas; 79% in Asia; 57% in Africa; and 15% in Oceania. However, despite some development gains and major investments in several countries, e-government and digital divides persist, it says. For instance, 14 countries in the Low EGDI group are African and belong to the least developed countries (LDCs). The survey also finds that insufficient training and accessibility and “e-illiteracy” are the most common barriers to e-government resilience.

The publication stresses that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as an enabler of all phases of disaster risk management, from prevention, reduction, and preparedness to respond and recover, and emphasizes the need to protect critical ICT infrastructure from disaster impacts. In addition, it states that inter-regional and global data sharing and coordination among concerned countries and regions are crucial, considering that some disasters such as floods, cyclones and typhoons, and droughts are transboundary in nature.

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

The Recovery Units of Degraded Areas and Reduction of Climate Vulnerability (URAD) initiative was established in 2016 with the objective of financing actions to address the main drivers of land degradation in the Caatinga biome. With a minimum mandate of ten years, backed by a commitment of US$100 million dollars mobilized from domestic environmental fines, the project was tasked with reversing negative trends associated with land degradation. To kick-start the first two years of implementation, an additional USD$1 million was provided by Brazil’s Climate Fund, and US$9 million came from the international community.

While it is too early to measure the targeted long-term transformational change, the article points out that what has been achieved so far at the municipal level is contributing to “noticeable attitude and behavior changes in the population.” For example, community-level interventions were initially expected to take nine months but, according to the project, “all initiatives in progress have taken just four months to complete.” This is attributed to the project’s innovative approach, which simultaneously targets environmental, social and economic challenges associated with land degradation.

Communities that were initially suspicious of government projects “are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

Examples of social initiatives that promote all three sustainable development pillars include the use of fuel-efficient stoves to reduce wood consumption and improving sanitation to reduce water and soil pollution. Economic activities promoted by the project include beekeeping and integrated crop-livestock-forest systems. However, the blog notes that this last category is the most challenging because to succeed such interventions “must match the economic potentials of the community, the land and the capacity of the rural producers.”

Citing Valdemar Rodrigues, Director of Sustainable Rural Development of Brazil’s Ministry of Environment, the article adds that while local populations were suspicious of government projects in the past, the results obtained from the implementation of URAD have not only changed this view, but “communities are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

The URAD project is an example of transformative projects promoted by the UNCCD with the aim of contributing to the LDN target. So far, 118 out of the 196 signatories to the Convention have embarked on voluntary national LDN target-setting processes, with some countries proceeding to develop and implement a first set of LDN projects.

The awards event took place at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, with the ceremony hosted by Loyiso Madinga, a South African comedian from The Daily Show. Madinga and other speakers emphasized the uniquely important role of young people in solving problems and bringing people together, and of reaching across generations.

Johar’s poem was featured in a film, ‘We the Goalkeepers,’ screened at the start of the awards night. The poem concludes, “Because when you’re too tired of waiting on others/ to save the day/ You stand tall, and show that saving the world/ is child’s play.”

Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Progress Award to Dysmus Kusilu, founder of Solar Freeze. Kusilu said that growing up in Kenya, he was taught that to work in agriculture is to be a failure. Gaining inspiration from his “sweet grandmother and her sacrifices,” he decided to turn failure into success by inventing a pay-as-you-go service using mobile phones to help smallholder farmers store their produce more efficiently and increase their yields.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the audience of the UN’s launch of two youth initiatives earlier in the day: the Youth 2030 strategy and Generation Unlimited. She said the initiatives will put youth at the forefront of the UN’s work “in a more earnest way” than ever before. Among the areas of leadership shown by young people recently, she said the march towards gender equality and ending sexual harassment is “one of the loudest cries I’ve heard.”

Mohammed presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Changemaker Award to Nadia Murad, an advocate for the Yazidi community and genocide survivors. Murad said that following the 2014 attacks by ISIS to “ethnically cleanse” Iraq of Yazidis – during which Murad was abducted and enslaved – the majority of Yazidi people remain in IDP camps “in the same tents given to them in 2014.” Having lost her six brothers in the genocide and seen countless fellow Yazidi girls and women kidnapped, bought and sold, and disappeared, Murad said her survival “came with purpose, responsibility and hope.” However, hope “has an expiration date; it requires action to survive.” She said working together is the only way to heal after a genocidal campaign.

Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said the Generation Unlimited initiative aims to ensure that by 2030 every young person is in school or age-appropriate training. She presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Campaign Award to Amika George, a student who founded the #FreePeriods campaign and has built support for the idea of period poverty.

When George accepted the award, she told the audience that girls around the world her age and younger miss up to 20% of their school curriculum each year because they cannot afford menstrual products, and she campaigns to provide the products for free. She urged, “enough with the shame” and euphemisms that belittle menstruation, and cause social isolation and educational lags for girls in poverty.

Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, noted that the average age of the leaders, innovators and activists featured during the ceremony was 24 years old. He welcomed Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, praising her dedication to action for SDG 4 (quality education). Solberg spoke in her capacity as the co-chair of the UN Advocates for the SDGs to stress that “we need business with us” to reach the Goals.

The evening event also featured performances by Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter from the UK who performed against a backdrop of footage of himself and other Goalkeepers as babies and children, and Fatoumata Diawara, a singer-songwriter from Mali who was joined by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.

Since world leaders signed onto the 17 Global Goals in September 2015, the UN system has been trying to align itself with the new Agenda. This policy brief provides a snapshot of recent developments in the parallel but inter-related reform processes underway within the UN system.



Development System Repositioning

Following on a mandate developed through a series of consultations for what is known as the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR), and resulting proposals from the UN Secretary-General, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution (72/279) aimed at aligning UN development system with the 2030 Agenda through a “repositioning” process.

By the resolution adopted on 31 May 2018, the UNGA sets out decisions, requests and calls related to:

a “new generation” of UN country teams;

“reinvigorating” the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC) system;

revamping the regional approach;

strategic direction, oversight and accountability for system-wide results;

funding the UN development system; and

following up on the repositioning efforts at the global, regional and country levels.

In addition, the UNGA “looks forward to the update by the Secretary-General” on efforts to align the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) with the 2030 Agenda.

On 14 June, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres informed Member States that he was setting up a “lean” transition team that would work for 18 to 24 months, relying heavily on inputs from UN development system entities, including through dedicated working groups and overall steering by the UN Sustainable Development Group. Elaborating on these plans, Guterres announced on 26 June that the transition team will: operate under a “broader reform coordination structure” to ensure coherence with ongoing reforms in the area of UN management and peace and security; work under the oversight of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed; and be headed by Robert Piper, who was leading the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Bureau of External Relations (BERA). On 31 July, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Adviser on Reforms to lead the broader coordination structure, Jens Wandel, currently UNDP Assistant Administrator.

On reinvigorating the RC system, Mohammed presented the preliminary outline of a 24-month implementation plan and launched a series of informal discussions with Member States in July 2018.

According to an update from the UN Secretariat in late August, Guterres’ plan will be issued in mid-September 2018. It is expected to:

specify the transition of staff and operational support;

clarify UNDP’s new role in the UN Country Teams (UNCTs) on a fee-for-service basis;

elaborate on the regional architecture and multi-country offices (MCOs), as well as on new models of physical presence; and

identify risks and contingency measures.

On funding the UN development system, Guterres is expected to soon launch a Funding Dialogue to operationalize the Funding Compact, as mandated in resolution 72/279.

On DESA reform, DESA was expected to report to the UN Secretary-General in the first quarter of 2018 on the outcome of its internal review, after which he intended to update Member States. Information on this process is still to be made public.

However, on 21 June, DESA announced the appointment of members of the UN High-Level Advisory Board (HLAB) on Economic and Social Affairs, which was established following a request from the UN Secretary-General as part of reforms to the UN development system. DESA explained that the HLAB’s establishment is part of efforts to enhance the UN’s support to Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. The Board will aim to help DESA in its work to strengthen the UN’s “thought leadership on sustainable development” as outlined in the December 2017 report containing the Secretary-General’s proposals for UN development system reform.

The 16 members of the HLAB include former heads of state (Mexico, Chile), former ministers (Cabo Verde, Brazil), an expert in public health, and experts in economics. The members are appointed for a two-year term. The Board held its first meeting from 9-10 July 2018.

Peacebuilding Reforms

A second major track of reforms addresses the UN’s peace and security architecture. The Secretary-General proposed creating a Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a Department of Peace Operations in his 2017 report on ‘Restructuring of the United Nations peace and security pillar’ (A/72/525), and this was then taken up by the UNGA’s Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).

On 5 July 2018, at the conclusion of the Committee’s resumed session, governments endorsed the establishment of these two bodies (UNGA resolution https://undocs.org/A/RES/72/262c).

Management Reform

Also via Fifth Committee negotiations concluding in July, the UNGA approved the reorganization of the current Department of Management and Department of Field Support into a new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and Department of Operational Support, as envisioned by Guterres in his management reform proposals. Management reforms comprise the third major reform track launched by the Secretary-General.

According to the Secretariat in presenting its report on this topic, the new management paradigm will increase the delegation of authority, accompanied by a simplification and streamlining of the rules, policies and procedures, and by the development and dissemination of administrative guidance along with training, support, monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

Aligning UN Bodies with 2030 Agenda

On the intergovernmental side, discussions are underway on aligning UN intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda. This process began in 2015 and proceeded gradually, with efforts including a “mapping assessment” for reducing overlap between the UNGA agenda, the agenda of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the 2030 Agenda, and enhancing their synergy and coherence (UNGA 70), and a report containing recommendations for doing so (UNGA 71).

Most recently, intergovernmental consultations took place in the context of UNGA resolution 71/323 on ‘Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly’ of September 2017, in which the Assembly requests the President of UNGA 72 to identify proposals aimed at addressing gaps and duplication in the agenda of the UNGA as they relate to the 2030 Agenda. On 6 June 2018, the co-facilitators appointed by UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Belgium) proposed continuing the consultation process in the UNGA’s 73rd session. They underscored that the process should ensure that intergovernmental bodies adequately cover the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Goals and targets.

ECOSOC Strengthening

ECOSOC, for its part, has undergone multiple waves of reform in the past several years. A “strengthening” process in 2006 resulted in UNGA resolution 61/16, and in 2013, Member States agreed to an additional round of reforms (resolution 68/1). These were up for review, in turn, during the UNGA’s 72nd session (2017-2018).

On 23 July 2018, through a consultation process led by Iceland and Qatar, the UNGA adopted a resolution setting out a restructuring of ECOSOC’s segments and forums. On themes, the resolution mandates the UNGA to adopt one main theme for each year’s session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. For the segments and subsidiary bodies, the themes should focus on a particular aspect of the main theme.

Further on the HLPF, the resolution calls for improvements to the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) on SDG implementation. The ECOSOC Bureau will consider ways of optimizing the time for countries to present their VNRs, in order to improve the exchange of experiences.

Following the HLPF’s ministerial segment, the final day of the ECOSOC High-level Segment will focus on future trends and scenarios related to the ECOSOC main theme, and the long-term impact of current trends on the realization of the SDGs. The outcome of the HLPF and the high-level segment will continue to be a negotiated ministerial declaration.

This text provides the basis for the coming year. After that, ECOSOC arrangements will be reviewed in tandem with periodic reviews of the HLPF.

Coming up Next

Numerous reforms are underway at once, which can overwhelm calendars and attract criticism of “process proliferation.” A few concrete next steps to look out for include:

The Secretary-General to issue a plan for realizing the reinvigorated RC system by mid-September 2018;

The Secretary-General to launch the Funding Dialogue on a Funding Compact for the “repositioned” UN development system;

The Secretary-General to inform the UNGA, in the context of changes to the peace and security pillar, regarding the creation of the Standing Principals’ Group and four stand-alone divisions for Africa, during the main part of the 73rd session; and

The ECOSOC calendar to reflect changes during its 2018-2019 session, including that the July 2019 session of the HLPF is expected to: Feature improved VNR sessions; and Be preceded immediately by the Integration Segment in order to consolidate a range of inputs on promoting “the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development” and bring together key messages on the main theme, along with action-oriented recommendations to feed into the HLPF.

The report highlights that the positive effects of secondary school education for girls include near-elimination of child marriage.

The publication titled, ‘Missed Opportunities: The High Cost of Not Educating Girls,’ reports that fewer than two-thirds of girls in low-income countries complete primary school, and only one in three girls completes lower secondary school. SDG target 4.1 calls for ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030.

On average, the report notes, women who have a secondary education are more likely to work and they earn almost twice as much as those with no education. Secondary school education for girls also brings the near elimination of child marriage, lowers fertility rates by one-third in countries with high population growth, and reduces child mortality and malnutrition. In addition, the report highlights that women with secondary education are less likely to experience intimate partner violence, report higher levels of psychological well-being, and have healthier children who are more likely to go to school and learn.

Over the past 20 years, many countries have reached universal primary education, with girls’ enrollment at the primary level in developing countries rivaling that of boys. However, the report notes, larger benefits of education would come from completing secondary school.

In order to reap the full benefits of education, the publication recommends that countries improve both access to and quality of education for girls, and implement policies to support healthy economic growth that will generate jobs for an expanding educated workforce. It underlines that investments in the education system are especially crucial in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 40% of girls complete lower secondary school.

The step-by-step guide titled, ‘Strengthening the Business Case for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: How to Measure Value for Your Business,’ enables companies to calculate the business value of WASH interventions and estimate their financial return on investment (ROI).

Launching the guide, WaterAid cited estimates that every US$1 invested in sanitation returns US$5.5 in increased productivity, and every US$1 invested in drinking water supply returns US$2.

The non-governmental organization (NGO) stated that progressive companies now view WASH as a “core business” priority, rather than considering it a part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or philanthropic action. For example, ensuring better WASH services results in fewer worker sick days and greater efficiency of operations. The guide seeks to meet the need of companies to provide robust evidence of the financial value of investing in WASH.

WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, and greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains.

Previous research conducted by WaterAid showed that, while many multi-national companies did have WASH policies in the workplace, there was typically less attention given to WASH in the supply chain and in workers’ homes.

The guide proposes six steps for measuring the business value of WASH interventions: 1) understanding the “impact pathway” in terms of the anticipated outcomes and impacts for people, communities and businesses; 2) identifying what to measure and how; 3) establishing a baseline; 4) implementing and monitoring WASH interventions; 5) analyzing data and measuring benefits; and 6) communicating the results.

The agency notes that WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains, and better stakeholder relationships for companies.

The guide was created and published in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Many other companies and international organizations contributed to developing the guide, including Diageo, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Sainsbury’s, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and CARE International, among others.

WaterAid and partners launched the guide on 30 August at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden.

This article is brought to you thanks to the strategic cooperation of The European Sting with the World Economic Forum. Author: Carolien de Bruin, CEO and founder, C-Change & Josephine Damstra, Partnership lead, C-Change & Dave Prescott, Senior Associate, The Partnering Initiative (TPI) We invite you to visit the streets of New York during the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the annual meeting where leaders from across the world, from all sectors and all impact domains, come together to expedite their progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These leaders and their entourages converge on the same stretches of congested, restricted-access roads. Traffic barely moves and a lack of signposting means they often struggle to determine the conversations in which to take part and whom to join in action.

The physical traffic situation during the UNGA is a fitting metaphor for the state of the online infrastructure that underpins the sustainable development agenda today. Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing. A CEO survey by PwC suggests in 2015 only 13% corporate CEOs had the tools in place to measure their impact against the SDGs. While we believe that this number has since shifted, delivery barriers still exist and will be apparent in public sector and civil society organizations alike.

Meanwhile, C-Change research has found 200 online platforms dedicated to facilitating learning, collaboration or the channelling of financial and non-financial support towards sustainability. Few have reached the critical mass needed to do so effectively and at scale, while many exist in isolation or even operate in competition with one another. The result is a fragmented, sub-scale system. TPI has found a similar pattern in its work supporting the development of in-country platforms dedicated to encouraging multi-stakeholder partnerships for the SDGs.

This infrastructure gap results in a reality where not enough is known about actual, on-the-ground needs and solutions, or where much needed, collaborative action agendas fall flat. It also means that essential capital doesn’t reach the businesses or organizations that deliver these solutions or that they fail to go the last mile in achieving measurable results. Resources go to waste and we are back in a congested traffic situation, with hundreds of actors getting lost, stuck without fuel or arriving late at their destination.

We believe the current situation is untenable and unnecessary. Untenable as we are getting dangerously close to doing irreparable damage to our world and urgently need new tools of the trade that effectively shift behaviours and enable sustainable decision-making; unnecessary, as we collectively have the resources, skills, and technologies to do so. It is high time we collectively bring our SDG infrastructure and online systems into the 21st century.

Our five-point transformation plan is simple in intention but ambitious in scope:

1. Universal standards, tools and definitions

In a recent blog post, the Omidyar Network calls for shared definitions, tools, standards and data to help investors navigate an increasingly diverse impact market. We agree and would add that the same is true across the development field, where efforts to build platforms for multistakeholder collaboration too often lack alignment. Such alignment between platforms is critical to ensure capital flows to the most effective investment opportunities. It is also needed to create the maps that allow individual actors and consortia to carve out their paths and destinations. Efforts such as those by the Impact Management Project (IMP) and the World Benchmarking Alliance, who collectively consulted more than 1,000 organizations from all sectors on effective ways to evaluate impact, are critical to achieving such alignment. The UN has an important role to play in translating such standards to the SDG framework.

2. A shared, interoperable SDG backbone and open architecture

An easy mistake to make in the world of collaboration and platform development is launching a new solution with the intention of immediately becoming a ‘platform of platforms’. Addressing fragmentation by adding a new solution can hardly be the answer. Treating today’s vast universe of online SDG hubs and platforms as unique and independent, while bringing in place the backbone infrastructure and protocols that enable aggregation and content exchange can be a solution.

Efforts, such as the UN’s API Highways initiative, are great first steps, yet more needs to happen to make it easy and worthwhile for online platforms all over the world to feed into and contribute to a shared backbone. A joining of forces between smaller specialist sustainable solution providers and tech giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, or Google – given their existing reach, platform strength, and ability to set standards – will be important.

3. (Wise) use of frontier technologies

Exacerbated by a scarcity of tech expertise and financial resources, we would argue that the role of technology as a lever of change is underutilized and often an inhibitor to impact when solutions are ineffectively implemented or managed. This is equally true for the use of established technologies and those that have emerged as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or blockchain.

Large companies are showing the way forward here. We seeing blockchain used to promote sustainability goals, with examples such as Coca-Cola’s work with the US State Department on forced labour or Unilever and Sainsbury’s work with tea smallholders. Much can be done to take advantage of these frontier technologies as well as “bread and butter” technologies to establish a decentralized, disintermediating and more intelligent SDG environment that includes greater transparency, efficiency and decentralized data ownership.

Multiple “tech for good” coalitions (e.g. Consensys’ Blockchain for Social Impact and UNDP’s Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development) have begun to explore ways to do so. Such coalitions have an important role to play in building the right bridges between tech and sustainability, surfacing tech solutions that actually work and – especially in a world of blockchain mania – maintain a sense of realism while ‘SDG coins’ pop up left and right.

4. Human-centred design

Deep engagement, collaboration or investment is rarely the result of technology alone. Effective solutions require the integration of both human and tech factors. Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab put his finger on this when he stated that: “In the end, it all comes down to people and values. We need to shape a future that works for all of us by putting people first and empowering them.”

Putting this design principle at the heart of all development efforts and ensuring that a cadre of leaders and individuals stands that is fluent in both tech and sustainability are involved is important.

5. A pooling of resources

An important inhibitor of the use of technology in support of the SDGs has been a lack of resources or, as some argue, insufficient investment in an infrastructure to enable its use. While the tide has begun to turn, the capital that is available (grant or investment) to bring in the right solutions has not been at the level required to truly unblock the system.

This is not surprising: a number of failed platforms and the need for a long investment horizon to achieve the financial returns on such solutions make many hesitant to commit. Our solution? Pool efforts to bring the capital and non-financial resources together that are needed to support those solutions that collectively lead to the standards and decentralized, interoperable systems so critical for SDG success.

To deliver on this plan, the UN has a unique role to play in “corralling the troops” in support of a shared SDG tech agenda or blueprint, but also in getting providers and partners to adhere to open architecture protocols and standards. Governments and philanthropic institutions with an interest in stimulating collaboration and private sector investment in the SDGs must do the same and support solutions that contribute to a more navigable system.

To individual platforms we say: don’t build a new platform when the need to do so is not clear. And, when you do, use the systems that already exist – which is the case nine times out of 10 – and align to the protocols that enable an exchange of content.","Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing.

For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing."" Every day our scientists are working to discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives. And for us goal number three allowed us to have a dialogue and an engagement with the United Nations and with governments globally to ensure that we're partnering with them to provide access to quality healthcare.

When we think about access to medicines we think about a comprehensive strategy that includes both donation and philanthropic support as well as creative commercial strategies designed to drive access to the most vulnerable and underserved populations globally.

So for Pfizer we have a number of initiatives that we're very proud of. One which I like to say is our oldie but goodie was launched in 1998. The International Trachoma Initiative was launched to address a blinding disease called trachoma. At the time it was launched, we had a product that treated active infection that causes this disease. And if the infection goes untreated over time people do go blind. And what we discovered was that our medicine could treat this infection, but our medicine was not sufficient: Alone that medicine would not do the work that needed to be done at a public health level.

For our work to address a blinding disease called trachoma we've used a public health strategy called SAFE. SAFE stands for surgery – S, for advanced cases of the disease. A – the distribution of the antibiotic that Pfizer makes to treat the active infection. F which is face washing and E which is environmental development. Together that comprehensive initiative working now with more than a hundred partners has achieved elimination of this disease in six countries. That's profound. And it's one of our greatest accomplishments as a company. It did not happen overnight. It has taken more than two decades to achieve that progress, but we have our eyes on the prize which is full elimination of this disease by the year 2020.

Another example where Pfizer is working to meet the evolving global health needs is in the area of oncology. We have chemotherapy agents that are very important for patients globally. And we worked with our partners, the American Cancer Society, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and CIPLA to make 11 prioritized chemotherapy agents available in East Africa where there is a disproportionate burden of cancer. We're really proud of that initiative because we're taking some of our very important core essential medicines and making them available to reach more patients in areas of the world that several years ago did not have this need.

So the business case for corporate responsibility has been debated for years and there are different perspectives on this. I think for Pfizer and for the pharmaceutical companies we can't deliver our business unless we deliver for society.Keeping that patient that we serve front and center to how we make the decisions that the company takes every single day.

When we discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives our communities are healthier, society is healthier, and we deliver both for our business and our shareholders, but also for society.","For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing.""

The SDG12 award was handed over to AIF representatives by Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES) at an event held on September 4, in Swiss capital Geneva.

One of the targets of SDG12 is support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production

AIF presented the most convincing concept on SDG 12 indicating a practical cooperation venture between the government of Rwanda, consortium of various banks, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in this area.

AIF Rwanda is a leading manufacturer of high quality and nutritious complementary foods in Rwanda, and a joint-venture between government and a consortium of Royal DSM, Dutch development bank (FMO), DFID Impact Acceleration Facility managed by CDC Group plc and International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.

“We are very honored and proud to have received the SDG Award of the Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES) for the first time ever,” AIF Rwanda said in a twitter statement.

Along with the award, AIF Rwanda also received prize money of 4,000 Swiss francs from which Amar Ali, CEO of AIF donated 4,000 Swiss Francs to orphans living in Mbuye Sector, Ruhango district, Kizibere village.

“We were impressed by the way in which Africa Improved Foods combines its social commitment with the successful networking of public and private players,” says Dr. Anne le Duc, CEO of SGES, upon announcing the first award winner.

On May 31, 2017, AIF opened its state-of-the-art facility in the city of Kigali, where it produces an annual output of 45,000 tonnes of fortified blended foods, employing over 300 staff.

The company offers 24,000 Rwandan farmers sustainable income for a proportion of their harvest.

Its first two products are porridge flours with added milk powder, vitamins, and minerals.

The factory recently celebrated its first anniversary and will soon have the capacity to feed two million people and be able to reduce stunting in Rwanda from 38% to 32% by 2020 – a 6% reduction – bringing hope to tens of thousands of children.

AIF Rwanda was this April named among the finalists of the 2018 World Changing Ideas Awards (WCIA), in the food category among the 12 companies awarded in areas of health, technology, consumer products, energy, transport and education.

The $60million investment in Rwanda was named top of ten local business leaders during the 5th edition of the Rwanda Business Excellence Awards 2017 by Rwanda Development Board.","Rwanda’s Africa Improved Foods (AIF) factory has scooped the first Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Award for promoting sustainable consumption of food patterns and fighting malnutrition.

Community members met with Heart Institute executives on Thursday, Sept. 13 at the Cornwall Golf and Country Club, where it was recognized that Cornwall and SDG has raised $515,000 of the local goal of $1.5 million.

“In honour of the wonderful generosity of the community leaders in Cornwall…I’m very proud to announce that in our new, renovated Cardiac Imaging Centre at the Heart Institute…we are going to name it the Cornwall and SDG Community Nuclear Cardiology Room,” said Dr. Thierry Mesana, President and CEO of the Heart Institute.

Cornwall and SDG residents account for 10 per cent of all procedures and over 6,000 visits annually at the Heart Institute. In 2013, a fundraising campaign of $80 million was launched to support the over $200 million expansion project – the largest expansion in the Institute’s 42-year history.

“We’ve made tremendous progress, but like any fundraising campaign, the first part is easier than the last part…we need as much support as we can get,” said Jim Orban, President and CEO of the Heart Institute Foundation.

Dr. John Paul DeYoung highlighted the evolution he has seen in cardiac care since he started working locally approximately 35 year ago. He noted how privileged our region is to be associated with the Heart Institute and how it deserves to receive continued community support.

“Cornwall might not have the deepest pockets, but a lot of people reach very deeply in this community. I’m astoundingly impressed,” said DeYoung.

“Every day we reach out to the Heart Institute to ensure that patients get the care they require. We enjoy a great partnership,” said Jeanette Despatie, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Cornwall Community Hospital (CCH).

Tommy Kaneb, a local volunteer and philanthropist, noted how the Heart Institute is not only Ottawa’s, but it is very much Cornwall’s too.

“If someone living here has a (cardiac) problem, that’s our hospital,” said Kaneb.

In May, Pamela Taylor of Cornwall had a pacemaker implanted to regulate her heartrate. Taylor, who overcame a number of health challenges, resulting in a triple bypass in 2000 and chemotherapy in 2010, moved to Cornwall in 2014 to be closer to family. After being unable to find a family doctor and encountering more health battles, Taylor relied on the help of Nurse Practitioners Nancy MacDonald and Marion Watts, who then introduced her to Dr. DeYoung and he then referred Taylor to the Heart Institute. Taylor feels very blessed and fortunate to live in close proximity to the Institute.

“I am very pleased to see that people here feel that this is their Heart Institute even though they don’t live in Ottawa,” said Dr. Mesana. “We always try to cultivate the family spirit at the Institute so we hope they feel comfortable and safe, and the kindness and compassion. To me this is essential…it’s not just top notch doctors doing complicated procedures, it’s delivering the compassion and a very patient-central approach. We are thrilled with the generosity from the SDG community contribution.”

“This has been a challenge for us to look at,” said Simpson.

An ad-hoc committee had been formed to see if it would make sense for the counties to become involved with the airport along with the Township of South Glengarry and the City of Cornwall.

The group came together after the city and township received a report in 2017 recommending SDG become an owner of the airport. The report based its recommendation on the benefits the airport could bring to the entire region if it were owned by the city and SDG. The airport is based just north of Summerstown in South Glengarry.

“Essentially we just came to the conclusion that based on the current configuration of the airport and for reasons we talk about in the report, it would be difficult to become involved at this point,” he said.","Article contentThe United Counties of SDG will not be involved in owning the Cornwall Regional Airport.

Article content ALEXANDRIA – A new initiative was launched on Wednesday by Community Living SDG that will match people with intellectual disabilities with willing employers in the community. “The Ministry of Community and Social Services approved an Employment Modernization grant for us here at Community Living,” said Danielle Duranceau, executive director of Community Living Glengarry. “There are three strings to the grant. The first had to do with the transition of people leaving the shelter for a meaningful day in the community. The second string was the one we have focused on for a long-term basis.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Community Living SDG launches new employment initiative Back to video Duranceau said the idea was to form long-term relationships and partnerships with the local community. “We were able to do this with the cooperation of two other organizations, Community Living Stormont and Community Living Dundas,” she said. “We thank you. We have also partnered with GIAG from an employment point of view.”

Article content The last string of the grant was whatever Community Living could come up with and the resources and tools they develop should be shared from a provincial level point of view with other remote rural communities in Ontario. “Throughout the last several months all the agencies have been working closely together developing and promoting the new Employment Connector services of SDG,” said Michelle Alguire, executive director of Community Living Stormont. “Although we are different agencies, we stand united with our belief in employment support. We believe that people with intellectual disabilities have the right to work in their communities and to earn a fair wage for the work they do.” Alguire said they also believed the Employment Connectors support services will engage and recruit new employers. “We are hoping this is what is going to happen,” she said. “They are going to engage and recruit new employers and build on the ones we already have. The service will also focus on explaining the reason why employers will benefit by hiring people with intellectual disabilities.” The Employment Connector services will also focus on on-site job coaching and provide the resources and tools people will need to educate and train the employees to do their job. “We are so excited by what is happening here and (we hope) you will be enthused by what is coming as well,” said Debbie Boardman, executive director of Community Living Dundas. “We are so pleased to be involved in this initiative for people who have intellectual disabilities.”

Boardman thanked a number of people who helped with the Employment Connectors initiative and made sure to thank a special young man. “I would be remiss if I didn’t thank Jeffrey (Faye),” she said. “Jeffrey is a young man who is involved in the video and he works at Foodland in Winchester. Thank you to Jeffrey for giving us the opportunity to share your story.” The video Boardman referred to was a promotional video to explain how employers can benefit by hiring a person with intellectual disabilities. The idea is to share this video across the province to assist agencies in rural areas. “I would like to thank the three executive directors for being very supportive in this endeavour,” said Maurice Dupelle, manager of Community Living Glengarry. It’s huge to brand a new program and promote it and try to implement it in our community.” “I’m anxious to see how it is going to be implemented and rolled out in our communities,” said Alguire.

We focus particularly on knowledge offerings relating to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 10 (reduced inequalities).

Technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems, according to WDR 2019.

The World Development Report (WDR) 2019, released during the meetings by the World Bank Group, focuses on “the changing nature of work,” particularly in the face of technological advances and fears that automation will replace employees with machines. The publication asserts that such fears are unfounded, noting that technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems. It considers issues raised by automation and digitization vis-à-vis businesses, and reviews how these impacts can be harnessed to promote social protection and inclusion, describing the idea of a new social contract. A summary blog on the report is also available. The report also presents the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which was formally launched in Bali. A World Bank press release notes that “jobs of the future require more investment in people.”

However, Sophie Edwards reports on Devex that civil society responses to the WDR have been less than positive, due to “a strong deregulatory thrust” and “attacks on many basic work rights” in a world where “technology is pushing down the value of labor in the economy.” Edwards notes that in a side session during the annual meetings, World Bank staff painted an optimistic scenario where new opportunities are created, but flagged that the poorest citizens and informal workers may not be able access those new jobs without increases in social protections from governments.

Also exploring fears of negative impacts on employment, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive Development released a report titled, ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth: From paralysis to preparation.’ The report examines the impact of technological innovation on growth, jobs and livelihoods, recognizing that “technologies are radically transforming peoples’ lives.” It explores whether frontier technologies such as machine learning will indeed benefit the world’s poorest. The Commission finds that estimates of job losses due to automation—which range from 9-80%—are misleading because the methodologies behind them tend to “ignore the upsides of technological progress” that often result in new opportunities. The report identifies five pathways that developing counties can pursue to ensure inclusive growth: 1) raising value from agriculture; 2) new global value chains in manufacturing; 3) global trade in services; 4) linking the informal sector to the formal economy; and 5) diverse, connected domestic economies that reduce costs and increase innovation. Across these pathways, the Commission underscores the need to create “a digital-ready country” that guides markets towards innovation through broad support for entrepreneurs and maximizes inclusiveness by ensuring a level playing field. The Commission is hosted by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.

Shanta Devarajan, Acting Chief Economist of the World Bank, compares the two publications above – ‘The Changing Nature of Work’ and ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth’ – in a post on The Brookings Institution’s blog titled, ‘the future of inclusive growth.’ Devarajan notes that both paint “an optimistic picture of the impact of technology on developing countries” and “provide a robust platform for harnessing the power of technology for inclusive growth.” Each report, he explains, addresses the impacts of technology on inequality, noting that efficiency gains outlined in the Pathways report can benefit poorer segments of society. He writes that farmers, who tend to have comparatively low incomes, could benefit from improved crop yields driven by data analytics and biotechnology. However, he cautions that the WDR articulates a blurring of firms’ boundaries, changing production patterns and employment trajectories.

Turning to SDG 10, Development Finance International (DFI) and Oxfam launched the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2018. The index, which assesses governments by their initiatives to bridge the gap between rich and poor, focuses on efforts in three policy areas: social spending, progressive taxation, and higher wages and stronger labor rights for workers (particularly women). This second edition builds on the 2017’s “beta version,” adding new sub-indicators in the tax and labor categories. Top overall performers include Denmark, Germany and Finland, while laggards are Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Haiti. However, the findings stress that all of the 157 countries it covers “could do more, even those near the top.”

IBON International published a paper, titled, ‘Implementing the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): Reinforcing Corporate Capture of the Global South.’ The piece looks into the implementation of the MFD model in Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, and articulates a need to move beyond this approach. The authors argue that the systematization of private actors in the model poses risks to peoples’ right to participate in development. They cite a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report that finds “differences in private and social returns” of “bankable” projects under the MFD approach, and call for national development strategies to “be owned and led by the people… whose rights to land, social services and to development are at stake.”

On financing poverty eradication more broadly, Development Initiatives launched ‘Investments to End Poverty 2018’ during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The report explores ways of strengthening aid amidst a “rapidly changing development finance landscape,” the mobilization of all resources to leave no one behind, and moving from data to impact through increased transparency. The executive summary emphasizes that business as usual leaves people behind, and that urgent action is needed to change trajectories on meeting aid commitments and identifying the synergies between difference resources. It highlights growing global inequality, lamenting that that the world’s poorest are “falling further and further behind,” that information provision has not kept pace with the need for disaggregated data, and that investments must be made to ensure both wellbeing and economic potential, such as social protection, health and education.

Finally, as noted above, the World Bank launched its Human Capital Index, one pillar of the Human Capital Project, which aims to raise awareness on lack of investments in “human capital,” which encompasses peoples’ skills, health, knowledge, and resilience. Investing in these areas can enable increased productivity, flexibility and innovation, and can act as “a central driver of sustainable growth and poverty reduction,” the authors argue. The Index reviews five indicators on health and education that can be linked to productivity as an adult, in order to arrive at an aggregate score between 0 and 1. As noted by Devex, Singapore tops the list with a score of 0.88. The Human Capital Summit was held on 11 October 2018, in the margins of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

A report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, ‘Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them,’ examines why some emerging economies have grown faster and more consistently than others. The report examines 71 developing economies and identifies two factors that help explain their “outperformance”: a policy agenda that promotes growth, and the role of large companies. Among other findings, the authors highlight changes in the global landscape on demographics, trade patterns and the digital revolution, which they note provide new opportunities in both manufacturing and services.

199,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iom-provides-guidance-on-integrating-migration-into-sdg-planning/,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IOM Provides Guidance on Integrating Migration into SDG Planning,"9 October 2018: The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has issued a guide to help policymakers integrate the migration aspects of the SDGs into local and national planning processes. The guide titled, ‘Migration and the 2030 Agenda: A Guide for Practitioners,’ discusses the interlinkages between migration and the SDGs and suggests a process for integrating migration and the SDGs into legislation, policies, programmes, projects and other initiatives.



The publication was developed with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). It notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development marks the first time that “migration is integrated explicitly into the global development agenda.” Within the 2030 Agenda, the central reference to migration is made in SDG target 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people). Other targets are also related to migration.

The guide highlights the SDGs’ direct references to “migration-related issues,” as well as cross-cutting connections where SDG areas “may affect or be affected by migration.” On the SDG targets that directly reference migration (direct connections), the guide identifies: student mobility (SDG target 4.b); human trafficking and exploitation (targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2); labor migration and employment (targets 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8); migration governance (target 10.7); remittances (target 10.c); and migration data (target 17.18).

The publication identifies cross-cutting connections between migration and the following areas and targets:

Poverty and growth (SDG targets 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 10.1);

Social protection (SDG targets 1.3, 5.4 and 10.4);

Health (SDG targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 5.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7 and 10.c);

Education (SDG targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 10.7 and 10.c);

Gender (SDG targets 5.2; 5.3, 5.4, 5.a and 5.c);

Children (SDG targets 1.2, 4.2, 4.5, 4.a, 5.1, 5.2, 8.7, 10.7, 16.2 and 16.3);

Cities (SDG targets 11.1, 11.3, 11.b and 11.c);

Climate change (SDG targets 1.5, 10.7, 11.5, 13.1 and 13.3);

Citizenship, rule of law and inclusion (SDG targets 10.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.7, 16.9 and 16.b); and

Diaspora and partnerships for development (SDG targets 8.9, 9.2, 12.b, 17.3, 17.5, 17.13, 17.16, 17.17 and 17.18).

The authors note that the implementation of migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda should be integrated with other sustainable development initiatives, and should engage all levels of government and across sectors. It encourages users to adapt the process to fit their unique context, and outlines four steps of implementation, namely: kick-off; prioritization; implementation; and monitoring and reporting. The guide also highlights: tools designed to help organize and inform actors as they work through the implementation process; suggestions for stakeholder participation; and relevant case study examples.

Among the case studies, the publication documents the experience of Armenia, which initiated a process of nationalizing migration-related SDGs. The process involved: examining migration and development issues in the context of the SDGs; prioritizing relevant targets; and developing a set of proxy indicators. It also comprised efforts on data, including an exercise to map migration data, and the improvement of national migration data collection and usage.

Another example discussed in the guide concerns the implementation of an IOM project in Ghana to support the government in mainstreaming migration into national development policies and achieving policy coherence, in line with the SDGs.

In December 2018, governments will gather in Marrakech, Morocco, to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Compact is the first intergovernmentally negotiated agreement prepared under the auspices of the UN aiming to address all dimensions of migration in a comprehensive manner.

The campaign has released each of the ten Things to raise awareness of climate change and accelerate climate action in the days between the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) and Climate Week NYC.

The GCAS, which took place in San Francisco, US, from 12-14 September 2018, brought together leaders from government, business and the global community to inspire greater global ambition to act on climate change. Climate Week NYC convenes on the side of the opening of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), and seeks to drive climate action forward. The Week is convening from 24-30 September 2018. Climate Week NYC released one Thing each day from 14-23 September.

The ten Things are:

Travel: This Thing encourages more sustainable travel and showcases sustainable tourism options. The Thing encouraged participants to share the most sustainable holiday they have ever taken, record a video about how their next trip will be more sustainable or tell visitors how to travel around New York City in a more sustainable way. Fashion: This Thing focused on opportunities for people to support climate action through clothes that they wear. The Thing encouraged participants to share tips for washing clothes without hurting the environment, wear vintage clothing or take a selfie in sustainable clothing. Food: This Thing promoted sustainable food as a way to support climate action. The Thing encouraged participants to tag their favorite climate-conscious restaurant during Eat for Climate Week, take pictures of their favorite sustainable meals or snacks or tweet about how to cook using leftover food and scraps. Water: This Thing called for advice on how to save water and minimize the threat of climate change to water supplies and the world’s oceans, seas and lakes. The Thing encouraged participants to share speedy-shower playlists, tweet favorite water-safe, non-polluting products or use recycled water to tend a garden. Plastic: This Thing provided an opportunity for individuals or businesses to highlight actions to reduce plastic packaging and products and reduce waste. The Thing encouraged participants to record low-plastic packaging grocery shopping, tweet favorite low-plastic grocers, cafes and businesses or promote the use of reusable cups. Lighting: This Thing focused on simple steps to reduce the carbon footprint of light use, and highlighted the benefits of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. The Thing encouraged participants to video their office turning the lights off at night, make their energy use more efficient and share favorite eco-friendly lighting designs. Health: This Thing highlighted how being active can contribute to a healthy planet. The Thing encouraged participants to showcase favorite outdoor workouts, share pictures of bikes, skateboards and other sustainable forms of transport and tweet sustainable gym wear and healthy recipes with seasonal, local ingredients. Electric Vehicles: This Thing focused on electric vehicles, including electric taxis and electric public transportation. The Thing encouraged participants to showcase their electric transport, take an electric bus or taxi and share how their business is going greener. Recycling: This Thing shared ways to recycle better, including raising awareness about common things that should not be recycled (for example, dirty pizza boxes) and common items that should be recycled but are not (for example, paper). The Thing encouraged participants to share recycling methods, tweet recycling projects for families and film recycling lifehacks or upcycle furniture or clothing. Get Involved: This Thing focused on the grassroots role that people can play to influence their friends and family, from voting to volunteering. Through this Thing, the campaign provided a platform for small non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and charities in New York City to talk about the importance of becoming involved in climate action. This Thing further encouraged participants to share their community of “climate-conscious companions” or tweet about groups doing climate work.

The Campaign encouraged participants to share stories and images of each Thing on social media to raise awareness. [Climate Week NYC Press Release]","24 September 2018: Climate Week NYC launched the ‘10 Things’ campaign.

The portal tracks 51 African countries’ progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and displays the data in either an index or a dashboard format.



The index provides an aggregate measure of a country’s progress across all 17 SDGs. Progress towards an indicator is standardized on a scale of 0 (poor progress) and 100 (strong progress), relative to the objective of that indicator. For example, SDG indicator 4.1.1 measures proficiency in school subjects. The closer a country’s students are to achieving proficiency in these subjects, the closer their index ranking is to 100. Each standardized indicator score is then aggregated to determine a single value between 0 (poor) and 100 (strong) to a country.

Only seven countries in Africa have scores over 60 out of 100: Egypt, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Algeria, Mauritius, Tunisia and Morocco.

Of the 51 Africa countries that had substantial data to develop an index score, only seven countries had scores over 60; Egypt (60.70), Ghana (62.45), Cabo Verde (63.36), Algeria (63.95), Mauritius (64.04), Tunisia (65.88) and Morocco, who had the highest score with 66.08. Conversely, 16 countries had scores below 50, with the two lowest scores recorded for Somalia (36.15) and the Central African Republic (35.70).

Aside from displaying data in an index format, users can also view countries’ progress towards each SDG in an interactive dashboard. In the dashboard, users can view countries index scores on an SDG-by-SDG basis, or view a countries’ overall progress towards the SDGs in a trend-based dashboard.

The trend-based dashboard presents countries’ progress by using red, orange, yellow or green arrows to represent decreasing, stagnating, moderately increasing or on track trends, respectively. For countries with no available data on an SDG, white is used. Users can decide to view all 52 countries data, or filter searches based on five geographic areas: North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and or West Africa.

According to the portal, progress towards the SDGs varies widely by country and region. In North Africa, four out of five countries with data are on track to achieving SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and half of the countries in Eastern Africa are on track to achieving SDG 15 (life on land). In Central, Southern and Western Africa, 30 of 35 countries with data are on track to meeting SDG 13 (climate action). Although progress towards the SDGs is being made throughout Africa, no country is on track to meet SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) or 14 (life below water).

The Africa SDG Index and Dashboard is built on the Global SDG Index and Dashboard, which SDSN launched in 2016. The release of the Africa focused platform was accompanied by a publication of the same name, which further details findings and the methods used to develop index rankings.

The project seeks to serve as communication and educational tool to engage the global public in the SDGs.



The Good Life Goals is a joint initiative, and the 10-YFP Sustainable Lifestyles and Education programme, co-led by the governments of Sweden and Japan, is represented in the project by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES). Launching the goals at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, Solitaire Townsend, Co-founder of Futerra, remarked that sharing a set of clear Good Life Goals and meaningful actions for each SDG can help build confidence that everyone is important, needed, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

For each SDG, the Good Life Goals propose five actions that people can take to have tangible impact on the SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the project outlines the five following actions to “help end poverty”: i) learn the causes of poverty at home and abroad; ii) share and donate what you can; iii) buy from companies that pay people fairly; iv) save, borrow and invest responsibly; and v) demand decent wages and opportunities for all.

On SDG 13 (climate action), the project suggests to “act on climate” by: i) learning about climate solutions; ii) calling “for more renewable energy in your country;” iii) eating more plants and cutting down on meat; iv) walking and cycling rather than driving; and v) demanding leaders to take bold action “today.” A video on the Good Life Goals provides an overview of the actions that can be taken for each of the SDGs.

A WBCSD press release notes that, from a business perspective, the Good Life Goals can provide companies with valuable insight into the ways the SDGs link to the actions, activities and lifestyles of their customers, and this understanding can help brands more effectively engage with people around the behaviors that are connected to their products and services. WBCSD also remarks that exploring the linkages between people’s day-to-day lives and the SDGs can help businesses identify innovation opportunities capable of offering better and more sustainable lifestyles. Finally, the Good Life Goals can be used by brands, NGOs and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing sustainable development, and can provide companies with a simple tool that they can use to enhance awareness of the SDGs among their own staff and promote a corporate culture that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, WBCSD says.

Goalkeepers 2018 took place as part of the annual Global Goals Week on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s high-level debate.

Goalkeepers participants gathered on 26 September 2018 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, following an evening ceremony on 25 September to present awards to three young advocates.

The Heads of State of France and Sierra Leone participated in interactive sessions with participants, as did experts in technology, data journalism and humanitarian relief. Performances by artists from around the world highlighted urgent issues, and activists, advocates and community leaders emphasized that “change starts young” and discussed ways to make more progress towards the Global Goals.

France will increase its development aid from US$10 to US$50 billion by 2022, announced President Emmanuel Macron, beginning the day’s programme. He said France’s G7 presidency will focus on inequalities, and that the three root challenges of climate, education and health must be at the core of the Group’s agenda. He called for shifting one-third of global financial assets from “day-to-day business to climate business,” and said France’s development aid will be Paris-compliant. Highlighting the importance of education for young girls in Africa, he emphasized the need for “chosen fertility.” On health, Macron noted that France will organize the 2019 global replenishment for the Global Fund. Finally, he said youth should be able to dream of being an African of the 21st century, rather than a European of the 1980s.

David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s first-ever Chief Innovation Officer, spoke with Julius Maada Bio, President of Sierra Leone, and Bill Gates to address whether poverty is inevitable. Gates shared the findings of the 2018 Goalkeepers Data Report highlighting that while the global population has peaked, its geographical concentration is changing, with more babies being born in the poorest, most difficult circumstances. This means that, at least at the beginning of their lives, they and their families will spend their time seeking out food for survival, therefore unable to invest in education, health or building assets. Gates said the next wave of poverty reduction can come through investments in young innovators and other human capital.

Sengeh said Sierra Leone can be the blueprint for growth through technology and environmental resilience. To realize this, President Bio said the priority is free, quality and competitive education for “the last boy or girl in the village.” He noted the need for technology infrastructure to make this possible. Gates added that innovation can drive progress when it focuses on a big gap.

Stephen Fry, actor and director, and Richard Curtis, director, screenwriter and campaigner, who founded Project Everyone, recounted what made the MDG era “15 of the greatest years in human history:” they showed that “when the world focused on alleviating poverty and suffering, it worked;” and they encouraged a shift from addressing poverty as charity to seeing poverty as political. However, they said, there is no point in going only half way, and the SDGs serve as the MDGs’ sequel. They noted that many countries have taken concrete action to implement the Goals, businesses have identified a US$12 trillion opportunity, and 250,000 charity organizations have aligned themselves with the SDGs. But the momentum of the first few years of the 2030 Agenda can falter “without new energy,” they said, and they called on campaigners to push governments further in 2019. Moreover, in 2020, the world must “work out the big sea changes and the big funding solutions” to support the remaining ten years of SDG implementation.

Steve Waygood, Aviva, highlighted the World Benchmarking Alliance launched on 24 September. He said the WBA will rank the world’s largest 2,000 companies by their impact on the SDGs, in an effort to “reconnect people to their money” and its impacts in the world. Waygood said large-scale change will come not from regulation but from people with money ensuring that their assets are invested with integrity. Curtis added that Aviva aims to become plastic-free, has been carbon neutral since 2004, and invests heavily in renewable energy sources; by changing its own behavior, Aviva has gained the credibility to call on others to change.

Graca Machel urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

As part of a tribute to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel, advocate and member of The Elders, said the lessons of the past show the need to build movements and broad coalitions: transformation is “not going to happen in small groups.” She noted that “there is apartheid” in each of the 17 SDGs. Machel said Nelson Mandela had been “an ordinary young man who simply embraced one cause.” She urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

David Miliband, International Rescue Committee (IRC) President, echoed the reflections on getting “half way there” on extreme poverty. He said that new tools are needed for the second half of that journey, in order to fight poverty in places in conflict. He also said the current humanitarian system is “building future generations of poverty” by not directing enough resources towards education.

A panel of young experts, advocates and community leaders moderated by Melinda Gates highlighted that young people must be enlisted as “true partners” in delivering on the SDGs. Joannie Bewa, a physician in Benin, said young people are not just needy, but bring talent and innovation, and need to be involved in designing and implementing solutions.

Trisha Shetty, founder of SheSays, suggested tapping into leaders’ interest in public opinion, and shared her success in involving comedians in a social media campaign to get finance ministers to drop taxes on sanitary napkins. Shetty also highlighted the complicity of people who remain silent in the face of sexual abuse of young people. Addressing those in older generations who have not faced accountability, she said, “give up your seat. We will leave you behind, because we don’t want to leave others behind.”

Another conversation focused on protecting and supporting girls, featuring Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and child rights activist, and Jaha Dukureh, founder and CEO of Safe Hands for Girls. Satyarthi discussed the need for “child-friendly” education, and said social taboos block the provision of appropriate sex education. Dukureh encouraged the use of technology and media, noting that her Change.org petition to then-president Barack Obama led to an investigation on FGM in the US. Her work also contributed to the banning of FGM in Gambia.

Mona Chalabi, data journalist and illustrator, said she aims to “create joy” while providing data in her work for major newspapers. She stressed that readers should feel something while looking at data, since it can communicate injustice. She also uses her illustrations to disaggregate findings, showing the rates that apply to specific readers rather than broad generalizations.

The Goalkeepers event launched three “accelerators” to direct resources and make progress on specific issues. The 2018 accelerators are focused on: early literacy in Africa and Asia (managed by Room to Read); supporting youth to use data to hold leaders accountable (managed by CIVICUS); and community-based solutions for ending child marriage (managed by Girls Not Brides). Accelerator Stations were situated around the event to enable participants to invest in the initiatives.

Jayathma Wickramanayake, UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, elaborated on the data accelerator, which is called the Goalkeepers Youth Action Fund. She said data provide incentives to achieve the SDGs by clarifying the problems we face, and she said the data that exists must be clear. She encouraged young leaders to apply online for support for initiatives focused on SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The Goalkeepers day also featured performances from: Kenyan rapper King Kaka, who is also a UNICEF Advocate and highlighted his work to bring menstrual hygiene products to poor communities and to destigmatize menstruation; Broadway actor Nicolette Robinson, who sang over film footage of young girls’ weddings and child brides with their babies; and ten-year-old ‘DJ Switch’ from Ghana, making her first appearance outside her country.

Officials from governments, international organizations, and philanthropic organizations discussed aligning country visions and donor commitments to deliver SDG 2 and grow enough food to feed the world. The event served as the launch of the ’50 X 2030′ initiative to make data from farming households widely available and address the needs of the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers.

The event titled, ‘Data to End Hunger,’ took place on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the 73rd UN General Assembly (UNGA) high-level week in New York, US, organized by the governments of Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A performance from The Moth’s Global Community Program showcased the importance of data through storytelling, as three storytellers from Africa shared stories from their childhoods.

The project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia and ten in Latin America, by 2030.

Opening the meeting, Claire Melamed, CEO of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, stressed that the SDG targets and indicators are only as good as the data available to monitor them. Rodger Voorhies of the Gates Foundation announced a US$12 million contribution to the 50 X 2030 Initiative. Still under development, the project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 50 low and lower-middle income countries by 2030, and then make the data, combined with other information sources, widely available. The 50 countries will likely include 30 in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia, and ten in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Key partners on the initiative include the Gates Foundation, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Government of Germany’s Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the World Bank, FAO, the Global Donor Platform for Rural Development, and the governments of Ghana, Sierra Leone and Kenya.

Laura Tuck, World Bank, said the initiative will put the countries in the drivers’ seat, being country-demand driven. She added that where there is demand, the World Bank will help countries bridge funding needs to close the data gap through the International Development Association (IDA).

Jose Graziano da Silva, FAO Director-General, highlighted that there are currently 821 million people hungry in the world, and most countries lack the capacity to monitor the SDGs. Gilbert Houngbo, President of IFAD, underscored the need for disaggregated data to ensure no one is left behind in the efforts to end hunger. He called for making technology accessible and available to small holders to enable credible data. He emphasized that we cannot end hunger, ensure improved food security and nutrition, or demonstrate that agriculture is sustainable unless we can measure accurately what we have achieved.

A video presentation highlighted that there are currently 500 million farmers struggling in the world. The next decade will be essential, it said, as with better data they can find ways to double their yields and defeat hunger.

Following the video, delivering remarks on behalf of the President of Kenya, Peter Munya, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives, Kenya, noted that his country represents an exciting market for data, with mobile penetration having reached 90%, and 70% of the population having access to financial services. Observing that 25% of African start-ups are in Kenya, he emphasized the country’s need for a skilled population, a vibrant technological ecosystem, and a private sector that continues to lead. He further highlighted the need for: new data sources, including Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT); multi-stakeholder collaborations, especially with academia and the private sector; and using data for better decision making and building resilience.

Gyan Baffour, Minister for Planning, Ghana, on behalf of Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said the SDGs have put pressure on countries to immediately pay attention to data. He noted that data is an expensive endeavor, and governments are in the position of choosing between investing in data or in the issues that the people they govern see as priorities. Observing that SDG implementation has come at a time of data revolution, he emphasized that countries need significant support and input to learn how to interpret, manage, and use the data obtained from new sources. He said the 50 X 2030 initiative is a critical opportunity to that end.

The initiative will focus strategically on the intrinsically interconnected areas of biodiversity and climate change.

The 21 million Euro Joint Pacific Initiative for Biodiversity, Climate Change and Resilience was launched during the One Planet Summit in New York, US, one year after it was announced by French President Emmanual Macron at the 2017 edition of the Summit. The EU and France are contributing 10 million Euros each, with an additional one million Euros coming from New Zealand and Australia. The initiative also welcomes contributions from other donors.

The initiative aims to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding for climate action and biodiversity protection.

The joint communique by the four partners mentions that the initiative translates into concrete action their commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, complemented by the new European Consensus on Development, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Noting that these international agreements set global climate efforts on a new course, providing the international community “with an unprecedented opportunity for progress,” the communique links the initiative with SDGs 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land), 3 (good health and well-being), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The communique further explains that the project embraces “the twin goals” of climate action and biodiversity protection, with the initiative seeking to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding in these areas. By pooling resources and coordinating actions, it aims to help the Pacific region adapt to the effects of climate change, protect biodiversity, and increase resilience.

More specifically, the initiative will finance projects in areas such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, ocean governance (including sustainable fisheries and aquaculture), and the environment (including waste management, biodiversity and eco-tourism).

The initiative is linked to the Pacific-EU Marine Partnership (PEUMP) programme launched by the EU, Sweden, and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) at the Our Ocean Conference in Malta, in October 2017.

The Day focused on the theme, ‘Municipal Solid Waste.’



According to the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 99 percent of purchased items are discarded within six months, and the world produces two billion tonnes of waste annually. On World Habitat Day, UN-Habitat called for society to “make small adjustments to our consumption styles,” such as by making a conscious effort to fix broken items rather than throw them away, recycle correctly and identify and use alternatives to disposable plastic items, including bottles, cups, cutlery and plates.

The SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the New Urban Agenda (NUA) all address solid waste management. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) includes target 11.6, which focuses on reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management issues. SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) includes targets focused on environmentally sound management of all waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (targets 12.4 and 12.5) and reduction of food waste (target 12.3). Under the Paris Agreement, countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) can include action on waste management as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the NUA commits to “environmentally sound management and minimization of all waste.” UN-Habitat is working to support countries to translate these commitments into practical and sustainable actions at the local level.

The call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ asks communities, cities and towns around the world to rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.

In a statement for the Day, UN-Habitat Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, stressed that tackling waste management challenges “requires imagination and innovation,” and demands that people “rethink” waste. She observed that effective waste management “starts with us as individuals,” and stressed that, through collective action, the world can become “cleaner, greener, safer, healthier and happier.”

UN-Habitat supports cities to improve their waste management practices through implementing community-based waste management collection and recycling and supporting cities to design cost-effective systems to collect and dispose of garbage. The agency also created the ‘Trash to Art’ project, which invited local artists to “make a statement on sustainability” by creating art using discarded materials.

The global observance of World Habitat Day took place at UN-Habitat headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. In a statement at the event, the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, described solid waste management as “one of the greatest challenges of our time in a rapidly urbanizing world.” He urged every single person to take personal responsibility for managing waste, and called for developing innovative and sustainable solutions to tackle the global solid waste problem.

Also on the Day, UN-Habitat and its partners discussed a call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ that aims to recognize cities’ efforts to lead effective waste management initiatives. The call for action asks communities, cities and towns around the world to “rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.” Communities, cities or towns that improve their solid waste management and reduce their waste management expenditure will be publicly recognized as ‘Waste-Wise Cities.’

World Habitat Day is celebrated annually on the first Monday of October to reflect on the state of cities and towns and on the right of all to adequate shelter.

207,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-secretary-general-releases-strategy-for-financing-2030-agenda/,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Secretary-General Releases Strategy for Financing 2030 Agenda,"24 September 2018: The UN Secretary-General has released a four-year strategy for financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Strategy underscores the UN’s critical role in supporting and accelerating the mobilization of finance and focuses on three objectives to accelerate progress from global to local levels, linked to areas where the Secretary-General’s leadership can galvanize action.Titled, ‘The Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2018-2021),’ the Strategy was released on the occasion of a UN High-level Meeting on the same topic on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. A synopsis was released on 17 September 2018 as part of the webpage for the meeting.

The Strategy’s first objective is to align global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy argues that, when public policies are “firmly and consistently formulated to achieve sustainable development,” such policies can realign incentives and alter market perceptions of risk. At the same time, despite growing private interest in impact and sustainable investing, there are not yet globally agreed definitions of concepts and existing sustainability principles have not led to standards to guide sustainable finance, including sustainability bonds, SDG bonds or green bonds.

To deepen markets for sustainable finance, the UN is framing discussions on definitions, principles, guidelines and standards.

To address these challenges, the UN is working with global policymakers and regulators to increase understanding on the role of public policy in developing a sustainable financial system, including through framing discussions on definitions, principles and guidelines and developing standards to facilitate the deepening of markets for sustainable finance. In addition, private financial institutions are working with the UN to understand the relevance of environmental, social and governance challenges to finance, such as considering how to address sustainably in private enterprise and finance business models.

The Strategy’s second objective aims to enhance sustainable financing strategies and investments at country and regional levels. To achieve this objective, the UN will support the development of sustainable financing strategies at the country and regional levels, including by providing advice and support for creating investible projects, building enabling environments and developing financing strategies. UN country offices and regional teams will also provide capacity building support for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to support countries to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of their tax systems to provide government funding for the SDGs, including by addressing illicit financial flows, base erosion, tax evasion and tax transparency.

The third objective focuses on seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance. The Strategy identifies access to finance as a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable development, noting that the digitalization of finance has facilitated “major progress in financial inclusion” in recent years. Despite this progress, large gaps remain, particularly for women, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and people in the poorest countries. To close these gaps, the UN will bring together policymakers, financial regulators and innovators in the space of digital finance and fintech to exchange experiences and best practices on innovative financial instruments, including on the implication of new financial technologies for regulatory frameworks and the development of global norms.

To execute the Strategy, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives. The roadmap will build on key stakeholders’ current and future activities to mobilize investments and support for financing the 2030 Agenda.

The Deputy Secretary-General will lead the Strategy’s implementation on behalf of the Secretary-General, in coordination with heads of entities within the UN system.

UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey urged other countries to designate 30 percent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (MPAs) to address challenges posed by climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Target 11 and SDG target 14.5 aim to protect at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The UK is advocating for increasing this target to 30 percent by 2030. Currently, only seven percent of oceans are formally protected. Further, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), more effective governance and management of these protected areas is critical to ensure that these MPAs are not “paper parks.”

Coffey is expected to encourage other countries to support increased coastal and marine ocean protection during the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) high-level General Debate. The Government of the UK has also announced it will encourage adoption of the 30 percent target at the 14th meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties in November 2018.

Marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.

In a statement in New York, US, UK Environment Secretary, Michael Grove, also emphasized the importance of global action to protect the world’s oceans. He said the UK has already protected marine habitats,“but we must go further.” He called for working together to ensure the health of the world’s oceans for future generations. The UK has classified more than 200,000 square miles of coastal waters as MPAs and has pledged to protect four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim welcomed the UK’s call to enhance global marine protection. He stressed that “marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.” UNEP Patron of Oceans, Lewis Pugh, described the Government of the UK’s action as a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation. He stressed, however, the importance of focusing “not only on the number but the nature of the protection,” explaining that fully protected MPAs are necessary for the ocean to recover. If other countries join the UK and follow through on their commitment, he said, such a decision will be “the most important moment for ocean conservation in history.” [UNEP Press Release] [CBD Aichi Targets] [Lewis Pugh Website on Ocean Protection Press Release] [Climate Action Press Release]","25 September 2018: The Government of the UK has called for protecting 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.

The announcement came during the seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa, which convened in Nairobi, Kenya, from 10-11 October 2018. African experts identified priorities and expectations for the continent, including:

effective implementation of existing instruments and conventions;

entry into force of Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol;

completion of work on the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP);

support for African initiatives, such as the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the Africa Adaptation Initiative; and

predictable and adequate finance to fight climate change.

Participants also emphasized that converting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) into investment plans and other climate actions requires the appropriate enabling environment, including aligning contributions with existing national plans and enhanced capacity-building interventions.

The conference aimed to facilitate science-practice-policy dialogue, which focused on advancing and sharing lessons learned from implementation of NDCs, the role of climate information and services (CIS) to support them and climate finance for NDCs, which will require significant inflows of conditional finance for their implementation. Partnerships in Africa related to NDC implementation include the Africa NDC Hub, the African Partnership Facility for NDCs and the NDCs facility of the Agence française de développement.

The report recommends integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) into investment decisions to ensure sustainable development in a changing climate.

The report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters 1998-2017,’ examines key trends over the last 40 years on the effect of disasters on economic losses and human lives. The report finds that disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of US$2,908 billion. Out of these disasters, climate-related disasters accounted for 77 percent of the total. The report concludes that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and cautions that disasters will continue to impede sustainable development as long as the economic incentives to develop in hazardous-prone locations outweigh perceived disaster risk.

The report further cautions that economic losses suffered by low and lower-middle income countries are likely to have “crippling consequences” on their future development and their ability to achieve the SDGs, particularly SDG 1 (no poverty). Within this context, the report underscores the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and move towards a more sustainable world.

Economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.

Earthquakes and related tsunamis contributed to the largest number of lives lost, accounting for 56 percent of the total or 747,234 lives lost. In total, 1.3 million people lost their lives between 1998-2017 and an additional 4.4 billion people were rendered homeless, displaced, injured or in need of emergency assistance as a result of disasters. Although earthquakes caused the majority of fatalities, 91 percent of all disasters were attributed to storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather events.

The report profiles economic losses by country, with the largest losses in the US, at US$944.8 billion, followed by China, at US$492.2 billion, and Japan, at US$376.3 billion. Other countries among the top ten for economic losses include India, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Thailand and Mexico. Although high-income countries experience the majority of absolute economic losses, the report emphasizes that disaster events have a disproportionate impact on low and middle-income countries (MICs).

The report also raises concerns on the limited economic data found in disaster reports. The Sendai Framework for DRR includes Target c, which seeks to “reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.’ However, 63 percent of disaster reports do not contain economic data on losses from disasters. Low-income countries, for example, recorded losses for only 13 percent of reported disasters between 1998 and 2017; in other words, there are no loss data for 87 percent of disasters in low-income countries. These limited data hinder countries’ ability to measure progress towards this goal.

UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori, said the report’s analysis shows “economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.” She called for doing a better job of capturing economic data to better understand what works in reducing economic losses, saving lives and livelihoods and managing economic risk.

UNISDR released the report in advance of the International Day for Disaster Reduction, which takes place on 13 October, and this year focuses on Sendai Target c.

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

Over the next five years, the GRiF will provide financing to set up mechanisms such as national disaster insurance programmes to channel money to those affected by disasters. According to World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, up to 26 million people each year are forced into poverty as a result of natural disasters.

Up to 26 million people each year are forced into poverty as a result of natural disasters.

The GRiF will also, inter alia:

Provide technical assistance to develop, test, scale up and improve on financial solutions;

Strengthen the financial resilience of vulnerable countries by enabling earlier and more reliable response and recovery by establishing or scaling up pre-arranged risk financing instruments, including market-based ones like insurance;

Create incentives for disaster prevention, preparedness, response and resilient reconstruction;

Scale up existing and pilot new risk pooling mechanisms;

Test insurance premium financing for the poorest countries;

Explore new types of contingent financing to complement insurance;

Explore new financial structures, linking risk financing directly to disaster preparedness plans or to financing for resilient infrastructure; and

Seek to address a wider range of crises, such as humanitarian emergencies, over time.

The GRiF aims to: build on participatory approaches in preparing investments; incorporate gender, disability, age and other social vulnerabilities in designing financial instruments; harness sustainable private sector solutions for risk financing; and partner with regional catastrophe risk pools. The facility will contribute to the goals of the InsuResilience Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions, which aims to strengthen the resilience of developing countries and protect the poorest and most vulnerable from the impacts of disasters.

It clarifies that data are interoperable when they can be easily re-used and processed in different applications, allowing different information systems to work together.

The guide titled, ‘Data Interoperability: A Practitioner’s Guide to Joining up Data in the Development Sector,’ proposes a roadmap that can be used as an assessment framework by data managers in development organizations and governments to assess the degree to which their systems are interoperable. It brings together examples of good practices from across the development sector, and notes that new sections, examples and guidance will be used to update the guide.

Chapter 1 on data management, governance and interoperability discusses institutional frameworks and interoperability, oversight and accountability models, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks. It stresses the importance of “effectively governed” data, as data need to be controlled with oversight and accountability as they move within and between organizations during its lifecycle. It also notes that data issues need to be considered cross-cutting, in the same way that gender, human rights and partnership issues are considered in the development field, and calls for more cogent management, funding, oversight and coordination.

Chapter 2 on data and metadata models makes specific recommendations to overcome structural obstacles to data interoperability. It also provides guidance and examples for modelling multi-dimensional data in the development sector.

Chapter 3 explores the role of standard classifications and vocabularies in data interoperability, and highlights examples of commonly used classifications and vocabularies in the development sector. It stresses the need to adopt standard vocabularies and classifications early in order to expose data without ambiguities.

Chapter 4 on open data formats and standard interfaces provides an overview of various approaches that exist to make data “discoverable,” and discusses data formats, application programming interfaces and user interfaces to support interoperability. Chapter 5 on linked open data outlines guidance on the dissemination of data and statistics on the web.

The production of the guide was supported by an Advisory Group drawn from the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability membership. The Collaborative is convened by UNSD and GPSDD, and comprises over 90 individuals, ranging from official statistics representatives to local civil society groups.

Participants underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063, and recognized the importance of collaborative efforts between the UN and the AU to strengthen multilateralism.



The ADS was launched by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA), and took place from 17-18 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, alongside the UNGA’s debate on the development of Africa, on 19 October. The two-day series replaces the UN’s annual Africa Week, which had taken place since 2010.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored inclusive, sustainable development in Africa as both “a goal unto itself” and “also a leading tool to prevent conflict and crises.” He observed the region’s progress towards improved governance, stability and resilience. At the same time, Guterres recognized that parts of Africa remain fragile, and expressed concern about high levels of debt in some countries, volatile financial markets and looming trade conflicts. He noted that climate change impacts will “create additional strains” in the future.

Speakers also underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda and the AU’s Agenda 2063. Guterres observed that the approaches and policies of the UN and the AU “are more closely aligned than ever before” and both call for a prosperous, peaceful and secure continent based on good governance, human rights and the rule of law and aim to leave no one behind.

On gender equality, participants welcomed Ethiopia’s new government cabinet, which has achieved full gender parity among its ministers. The UN Secretary-General identified the AU as a crucial partner in the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to end violence against women and girls by 2030.

On climate change, the UN Secretary-General called for a “huge leap in investment” to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change in Africa, and called on developed countries to deliver on both finance and technology commitments.

On SDG follow-up and review, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Inga Rhonda King said the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will focus on the SDGs related to climate change (Goal 13), education (Goal 4), inequality (Goal 10), justice (Goal 16), jobs (Goal 8) and partnerships (Goal 17). She called on African countries to share their lessons learned to ensure progress on the 2030 Agenda.

Speakers underscored linkages between peace, security and development, with several recognizing Africa’s contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. The UN Special Adviser on Africa, Bience Gawanas, said the region seeks to “achieve peace, prosperity and socio-economic transformation,” and urged all actors to respond to Africa’s challenges in a coherent, coordinated manner. UN Security Council President Sacha Sergio Llorenty (Bolivia) highlighted the role of young people and women in peace and development efforts in Africa. He called for high-level political support to ensure their meaningful participation.

Speakers also welcomed the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and recognized the importance of financing for Africa to achieve the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 and the Paris Agreement. The dialogue also reflected on reform processes within both the UN and the AU.

An accompanying symposium offered countries the opportunity to share national progress on statistics for implementing the SDGs and Agenda 2063 and to discuss regional indicators for the two agendas.



Heads of national statistics offices (NSOs) from 51 African countries, representatives from international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, academia and research institutions and the private sector attended StatCom-Africa VI, which took place on the theme, ‘Enhancing the Capacity of National Statistical Systems to support policies for Africa’s economic diversification and industrialization.’ Participants identified the importance of national ownership, adequate resources and adequate resources for the region to support statistical transformation initiatives. They called for States to support the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the 2020 round of housing and population censuses.

In a keynote address, Vincent Hendricks, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reflected that scientists do not typically like to sell themselves or their products, believing that their value is “self-evident,” but he said “it doesn’t work that way” in reality. He urged statisticians to realize that they “are the experts and not the politicians” and they should use their data “for the good of their communities.” He called for taking ownership of their data and using it to change their communities, advance democracy and help African governments promote evidence-based policymaking.

The meeting also reflected on key challenges faced by NSOs, including enhancing the capacity of statistical systems and aligning statistics with global, regional and national development agendas. Participants underscored the role of creative and innovative approaches to overcome challenges, and called for all stakeholders to collaborate to meet the growing demand for data to inform and implement development agendas. Participants also supported disaggregating indicators for monitoring basic human rights as a way to address inequalities, and investing in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system.

The Director of the African Centre for Statistics (ACS), Oliver Chinganya, presented the ACS’ proposed strategic framework for the 2018-2019 biennium. The framework aims to “improve the production, dissemination and use of quality data and statistics” within the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. He said the Centre is working to support the design of national strategies on statistics, dissemination of information and best practices and production of harmonized statistics.

Participants took note of the statistical programme and urged UNECA to continue supporting States in building their statistical capacity in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ABCF).

Also within the StatCom-Africa VI meeting, the 13th session of the African Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 3-4 October 2018. The symposium focused on the theme, ‘Application of economic statistics and national accounts in support of sustainable development.’ Countries shared progress and challenges in statistical development in line with the SDGs, with some reporting on how their countries have aligned national development plans with the SDGs.

Others highlighted a lack of data to support SDG indicators. A representative for South Africa said that his country lacks data to compile economic indicators to support monitoring of targets under SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

216,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-launches-sdg-impact-platform-for-investors-and-businesses/,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Launches SDG Impact Platform for Investors and Businesses,"25 September 2018: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) presented the SDG Impact initiative on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly (UNGA). SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses to contribute to the SDGs, including by providing country-level data and SDG investment roadmaps.

The initiative invites investors and companies of all sizes to: 1) adapt and transform their core business strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and 2) to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.

The event titled, ‘How the Private Sector Can Align to the SDGs,’ took place on 25 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, served as the “soft launch” of SDG Impact, and was organized by UNDP and the governments of Turkey and Norway. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses with the clarity, insights, and tools required to support and authenticate their contributions to achieving the SDGs. It will have three offerings, beginning with “impact management,” which encompasses the principles, frameworks, and standards to help investors channel capital toward SDG achievement. UNDP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Impact Management Project (IMP), which is a collaborative effort of over 1000 organizations, housed by Bridges Fund Management, that works with investors on delivering impact through financial investment.

Steiner said UNDP expects to establish SDG impact management standards, working in partnership with IMP and a network including the International Finance Corporation, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative, and the UN Global Compact. The newly developed standards will be the basis for an SDG Impact Seal and Certification programme, he noted.

The second offering of SDG Impact, Steiner said, is “impact intelligence,” to provide investors with insight into local industries, entrepreneurs and projects that advance the SDGs. Finally, “impact facilitation” involves leveraging UNDP’s in-country presence for network development, and matchmaking between investors and enterprises working to achieve the SDGs. This component entails a forum called ‘SDG Impact Investor Convenings’ to build cross-sector connections and identify investment opportunities. An SDG Accelerator initiative of UNDP, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Republic of Turkey is currently in a testing phase, and will launch in Turkey to help enterprises and start-ups align their businesses with the SDGs.

Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, explained that by utilizing the convening power of UNDP, the Accelerator Program aims to catalyze market-based solutions for challenges of displaced people and residents of the least developed countries (LDCs). Upon the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, UNDP is running a feasibility study for the SDG Impact Accelerator. The initial project partners estimate that the design of the Accelerator and its feasibility plan will be completed by the beginning of 2019.

Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary, Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed that “it is a big problem if we educate our youth into unemployment,” thus vocational education is needed to respond to the demands of the labor market. He said Norway has launched a knowledge bank that serves as one-stop shop for expertise, ranging from fisheries and renewable energy to petroleum and taxation, and Norway will focus on investments in vocational training. He added that the lack of relevant skills also presents a major problem for the private sector.

Tilak Marapana, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said his government has started several social impact funds, from private equity to debt, including a US$5 million fund to provide support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). He mentioned that the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Sri Lanka is vibrant with many ideas, but needs access to financing and private sector support. To that end, the government has supported the creation of a binary impact investment network.

Stefano Manservisi, Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), said the Commission currently focuses on EU countries’ meeting their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as “we need to move from billions to trillions, but we need first the billions.” Two other EC priorities that he identified included fostering investing and working with countries to leverage domestic resource mobilization (DRM), especially through taxation. As sectors of particular importance for the Commission, he mentioned agribusiness, energy, creation of MSMEs, cities and digitalization. He called for a mix of ODA, public policies and private investment, he announced that the EC will invest €24 million over the next four years in the Horn of Africa.

The report titled, ‘Progress on Transboundary Water Cooperation under the Water Convention,’ is based on self-assessments submitted by 38 of the 40 countries that were Parties at the time of the reporting exercise in 2017.

In her introduction to the report, Olga Algayerova, UNECE Executive Secretary, hailed the report as a major “milestone,” highlighting that it also contributes to understanding the status of action on SDG target 6.5 on integrated water resources management (IWRM) and transboundary cooperation.

Countries that are not Parties to the Convention could use the reporting template to gain insight into what they would need to do to implement the treaty.

The self-reporting exercise was the first of its kind to be undertaken through the UNECE Water Convention, known in full as the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. Using a common template, countries reported on the existence of agreements, joint bodies, strategies and activities for cooperation. The exercise showed that most transboundary waters shared by signatories to the Convention already have agreements and arrangements in place; however, at least 15 transboundary river and lake basins do not have an agreement or arrangement in place for the whole basin, and at least 29 do not have agreements or arrangements covering transboundary aquifers. The report highlights several challenges for Parties to the Convention, including the need to harmonize governance systems, better engage with stakeholders, address climate variability, meet financing needs, and build technical capacity in the countries.

UNECE and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are co-custodians of SDG target 6.5. UNECE suggests that even countries that are not Parties to the Convention could benefit from using the reporting template, as it will give insight into what they would need to do to implement the Convention, and can also help them report progress against SDG indicator 6.5.2 on the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation.

The report was released in the lead-up the eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Water Convention (MOP-8), which takes place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 10-12 October 2018. Parties to the Convention meet every three years.

Originally a European agreement, the Convention opened for global signature in 2016 and now has 41 Parties, with Chad acceding to the Convention in February 2018, and Senegal in September 2018.

The trust fund aims to support a healthy and productive ocean, in line with SDG 14 (life below water).



The World Bank designed the trust fund named, ‘PROBLUE,’ to tackle challenges facing the ocean, including marine pollution, overfishing and coastal erosion. PROBLUE aims to address these challenges, promote a healthy ocean and sustainable blue economy and contribute to the World Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing the income and welfare of the poor in a sustainable manner. The initiative is part of the World Bank’s Blue Economy program, which works to ensure the protection and sustainable use of marine resources. Other active projects in the Blue Economy portfolio include activities to tackle marine pollution and implement large regional fisheries programs in Africa and the Pacific.

The World Bank’s Blue Economy program works to ensure the protection and sustainable use of marine resources.

PROBLUE will focus on four key themes: fisheries and aquaculture management; marine pollution, including plastics and marine litter; sustainable development of ocean sectors, including tourism, offshore renewable energy and maritime transport; and government capacity to manage marine and coastal resources in an integrated way.

To date, donors have contributed approximately US$75 million to PROBLUE. Norway provided the initial pledge to the Fund, with US$15 million as part of a planned multi-year contribution. Canada announced it will contribute US$50 million to PROBLUE. Germany, Sweden, Iceland and the European Commission (EC) have also provided financial contributions. Denmark and France are anticipated to make contributions to the Fund.

The initiative intends to strengthen cooperation on renewable energy, accelerate energy transformation in SIDS, strengthen climate resilience, and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.

Initially launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative was created to support SIDS in their process of scaling up renewable energy through partnerships across public institutions, the private sector, and inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations. Through coordination with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Lighthouses Initiative has led to a rapid growth in renewable energy for its members. For example, from 2014 to 2017 more than 250 MW of solar photovoltaic and over 50 MW of wind energy came online as an outcome of the Initiative resulting also in significant cost reductions.

The SIDS Lighthouses Initiative met its 2020 targets for installed capacity in renewable energy and funding three years ahead of schedule.

IRENA Director-General Adnan Amin commended SIDS governments for demonstrating, “tremendous leadership in harnessing their renewable energy potential and their strong political will to act.” In addition, the initial Lighthouses Initiative met its targets for 2020 three years ahead of schedule in terms of installed capacity and mobilizing funding. These are great successes for SIDS as they are more vulnerable to climate change effects when compared to other countries, he underlined.

Participants at the event discussed priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0 with many underlining that investments and access to finance remain a major challenge. Renewables only account for 10% of total installed capacity in SIDS. Participants suggested that taking the energy transformation to the next level with renewable energy at the center would lead to sustainable job creation, fostering economic growth, and ensuring food and water security.

IRENA identified four priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0: supporting SIDS in implementation and review of their nationally determined contributions; expanding the focus to include geothermal energy and energy from the ocean, as well as accelerating renewables in the transport sector; enhancing support for development of bankable projects; and reinforcing work on the nexus between energy, agriculture, food, health, and water.

Hilda Heine, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, discussed the urgent need for action and their accomplishments made possible through the Lighthouses Initiative. Recently, the Marshall Islands has begun a new solar project in their second largest community and are hoping to bring similar projects to life. Currently their other island communities are 100% renewable energy and are seeking support from UAE to help bring three of their major sub-centers to at least 95% renewable energy by 2020. Heine urged that the energy transition process be inclusive taking into account gender and human rights.

Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, spoke on limitations and progress. While three hydroelectricity plants in his country are being improved for efficiency and solar renewables are expanding, the major initiative focuses on geothermal energy. He noted that there is a two-year delay for the goal of 80% geothermal energy, but that his country is actively working with other organizations to meet this goal.

Aruba, the UAE, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) also participated in the Roundtable, speaking on issues ranging from project design, renewable targets, collapsible turbines, financial limitations, grant funding, and batteries.

The bag has the potential to contribute to reducing marine plastic pollution.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), over 60,000 microplastic particles are contained in every square kilometer of the sea, although this figure is even higher for some parts of the world. These microplastic particles come from plastic waste that ends up in the ocean and then breaks down into smaller pieces as a result of wave erosion, bacteria and other environmental effects. Marine life may consume these microplastic particles, which then enter the global food chain.

Roberto Astete and Cristian Olivares, who designed the soluble bag, were working on experiments related to biodegradable detergents. During their experiments, they discovered that using a derivative of limestone, rather than oil byproducts, changes the structure of plastic from indestructible to soluble. This discovery led to the creation of the SoluBag.

A traditional plastic bag takes more than 150 years to degrade. The SoluBag can be disposed of in water in a few minutes.

Chile became the first country in South America to join other countries in banning the use of plastic bags as a step towards tackling plastic pollution. More than 50 countries have taken similar steps as part of the UN Clean Seas campaign.

The side event served as the launch of UNEP’s Global Plastics Platform, which will encourage and support commitments to reduce plastic pollution.

Frans Timmermans, European Commission, opened the event held at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018. He said plastic pollution has gained widespread attention, but regulation is still needed. Referring to the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, adopted in early 2018, he said the EU plans to make plastics more circular and to ban them where there are feasible consumer alternatives.

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle urged participants to “rethink the whole problem of single-use, throwaway goods,” as recycling “only marks the start of another problem.”

Erik Solheim, UN Environment Executive Director, said the economic threat of plastic pollution can become an opportunity. He said UN Environment has established a Global Plastics Platform, which will support countries and cities in establishing policies to reduce plastic pollution. UN Environment notes that in 2018, a number of countries announced plans to ban single-use plastics: India said it will ban all single-use plastic by 2022; Botswana, Chile and Peru announced plastic bag bans; Nigeria revealed plans to establish recycling plants across the country; and Brazil announced a national plan on plastics.

In addition to policy support, the Platform will explore ways to change the design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, in line with a transition to a more circular economy. UN Environment reports that such efforts will include identifying opportunities to reduce economic and industrial waste. The Platform will build on and advance the World Economic Forum-hosted Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, the work of the Regional Seas Conventions, and other existing initiatives and partnerships.

UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

Susan Goldberg, National Geographic, moderated a panel with heads of state and ministers from Aruba, Canada, Colombia, Iceland, Norway and Rwanda, as well as business leaders in retail and waste management. Officials from other countries spoke from the floor. Speakers highlighted several commitments, policies and initiatives, including on single-use plastics:

Aruba will ban all single-use plastics by 2020, following its 2016 ban on single-use plastic bags;

Spain will ban plastic bags in 2021;

Rwanda has drafted a law banning single-use plastics, following its 2008 ban on plastic bags;

Norway is considering a ban on single-use plastics in coordination with the EU;

Kenya is working with the East African Community to extend its plastic bag ban to other countries;

Sweden and Costa Rica are working to reduce single-use plastics at the UN and in its missions, including through sustainable procurement practices;

Costa Rica has a national strategy to replace single-use plastics with renewable and combustible alternatives; and

Iceland places a recycling fee on plastic goods.

Canada banned the sale of microbeads in 2018, and Iceland is developing a policy on microplastics. Norway is establishing a producer responsibility scheme for discarded fishing gear. In Iceland, discarded fishing gear can be traced to its owner.

Colombia is implementing a strategy for packaging and packaging waste. The country expects to make use of 30% of its waste by 2030, and is managing waste through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The world’s fourth largest retailer, the Schwarz Group, is developing a strategy to reduce and recycle all of its packaging. Spain is finalizing a circular economy strategy called España Circular 2030, which will include plastic pollution measures.

In addition, Norway launched a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy on 24 September 2018, which will report in 2020. Norway also provided the initial pledge to the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund to support healthy and productive oceans, including by tackling marine pollution.

Almost all speakers underlined the need to engage the public and key stakeholders in order for the policies to succeed. Aruba’s Prime Minister noted that people resisted the 2016 ban on plastic bags, because the government had not worked to raise awareness before the policy change. She said that in preparation for the 2020 ban, officials have involved stakeholders to ensure that “people are begging for the decision.” Norway’s climate and environment minister said the government must involve the fishing industry in order to better control illegal discarding of fishing gear and waste at sea. Canada’s environment minister said that once the public learned about microbeads in everyday products, they agreed that it was a problem.

Suez, a leading waste and water management company, said 93% of plastic products use virgin materials, and encouraged increasing the amount of recycled plastic. France also called for businesses to include recycled plastics in their products, and said France will build on Canada’s work on plastics pollution as the Group of 7 (G7) president. In June 2018, the Ocean Plastics Charter was endorsed at the Canada-hosted G7 Summit by the EU, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

Canada noted that even with Canada being “good at recycling,” the rate is only 11%, so the chemicals industry has a role to play in finding “leapfrog solutions.” The UK noted the launch in partnership with Canada of a PPP, the Global Plastics Action Partnership. She called on companies such as Suez to make it easier to recycle plastic waste.

Sweden said it is spending US$10 million per year until 2020 to cover municipalities’ costs for cleanup, promote innovation to combat microplastic pollution, and reduce discarded fishing gear. Sweden also established a government inquiry on possible measures to “go beyond EU legislation” on marine pollution. She highlighted the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Ad Hoc Open Ended Expert Group to identify options for combating marine litter for consideration by UNEA-4, noting the need for stronger global and regional architecture on the issue. The Union for the Mediterranean said it is working to identify marine litter hotspots in the Mediterranean region.

Turning to the local level, the mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, highlighted the health consequences of uncollected waste. She said Freetown’s approach will include: getting collection systems working, which needs investment; starting a recycling system and encouraging more businesses to join the sector; innovation and competition for clearing waste and fighting plastic; and joining the move to ban single-use plastic.

The Office of UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said the UNGA President will launch a global campaign and call to action to address plastic waste “once and for all.” She observed that the UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

223,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/addressing-sdg-5-5-steps-to-promote-gender-equality-in-the-supply-chain,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 5: 5 Steps to Promote Gender Equality in the Supply Chain,"In 2015, the world got one step closer to a better future when 193 countries committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a framework for addressing the global community’s most critical economic, social and environmental challenges. These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Specifically, SDG 5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and should be a critical consideration for global supply chains, as there’s tremendous opportunity to make an impact. Women hold 60 to 90 percent of global supply chain jobs, particularly in the apparel and agricultural sectors, and represent the majority of workers in low-wage jobs in the lower tiers of the value chain. Despite their prevalent role, women lack access to social protection measures, especially maternity protection, and face limited career opportunities.

There are five steps companies in all industries and sizes can take to reap the benefits of gender equality in the supply chain.

1. Increase transparency with better metrics and reporting.

Setting up meaningful and accurate metrics and goals, appropriate to the size and sector of the organization, is key for quality reporting, which in the end means more transparency into sustainable progress. When teams have the right metrics for evaluating where the company and its suppliers stand on gender equality, it’s easier to set targets, measure success and benchmark performance against competition.

Start with the most basic key performance indicators (KPIs), such as gender ratio across various roles and the corresponding level of remuneration. GRI G4 standards provide robust reporting frameworks for gender equality and diversity.

2. Prioritize robust policies and programs.

If policies and programs to tackle gender inequality don’t exist in your supply chain, it is high time to design and implement them. When gender equality is weaved into the management system and this foundation for progress is in place, the next step is to prioritize gender-related programs. For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth. The cosmetics giant has put forward a sustainable sourcing program that specifically addresses the vulnerability of women when it comes to climate change. The cumulative effects of poverty, cultural and social barriers, exacerbated by climate change, put the health, wellbeing and livelihood of women at great risk. L’Oréal is addressing this critical issue through research and regional programs that empower women and help them diversify their income, and by supporting external initiatives such as Women4Climate, designed to create sustainable and inclusive communities.

A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality. One key step is to support female entrepreneurs or companies with a mission to fight gender inequality. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that in 2018 there are 30 percent more male entrepreneurs in the world and that women make up only 40 percent of the new entrepreneurs in the U.S. This makes it even more imperative to support the existing 200 million female business owners worldwide and encourage growth of female entrepreneurship across the globe. A company can send a strong message by selecting suppliers with effective gender-specific policies and programs in place. This is especially relevant for the retail and agricultural sectors, where low-tier workers are predominantly women.

4. Benefit from global expertise.

Demonstrate commitment to global goals and gender parity by partnering with leading organizations and joining key initiatives. As robust as gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs may be, there’s a lot to be gained by formally endorsing worldwide initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and HeForShe’s IMPACT 10x10x10 framework, or joining other national or local initiatives. Participating in well-established initiatives offers the chance to dip into a network of global experts on critical subjects and access best practices and tools that that can break through barriers to gender equality in your own operations and throughout your global supply chain.

5. Educate and train suppliers.

Forced and child labor is firmly on the agenda of most large corporations. However, few acknowledge the vulnerability of girls and women to modern slavery: Females constitute 99 percent of victims in the commercial industry and 58 percent in other sectors. By eliminating forced and child labor in your supply chain, you strongly contribute to achieving SDG 5. Engaging suppliers is key here — selecting only pre-qualified suppliers, continuous monitoring and training of existing suppliers, and engaging them in the conversation about gender parity and your vision of a fair and equal workplace are the most fundamental steps to have in place.

The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues. However, gender is an inalienable component of every other global goal. Educating girls and preventing child marriage helps eliminate global poverty, and full and equal participation of girls and women in global politics will definitely bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which the SDGs support.","These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Fish, which provide 20 percent of daily protein intake to about 3.1 billion people, is among the most widely traded food commodities — at a value of US$145 billion annually.

The demand for fishing poses a key problem. Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013. As a response, aquaculture and fish farming have increased in popularity, but the unmanaged expansion has caused pollution and habitat degradation, leading to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn, contributes to ocean acidification.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), implemented to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), include SDG 14 — Life Below Water, which aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources” of the world.

The challenge today is for corporations to fully embrace the concept that the oceans are an essential resource that need to be carefully managed to support a sustainable future. The question that remains is, how can the global community source fish in such a way that contributes to economic and business growth, without endangering the environment?

Three steps can promote sustainable fishing throughout company supply chains within the guidance of SDG 14:

Step 1: Map the supply chain to identify sources of risks

Operating a supply chain in line with SDG 14 offers businesses many benefits. The Goal aims to preserve the world’s oceans, ensure resources can be exploited sustainably, and fight poverty in the regions where fisheries and aquaculture are most common. Managing the supply chain in this way allows companies to reduce risks, secure resources and increase the positive impact of their activities. A supply chain risk assessment aligned with SDG 14 allows companies to know exactly where to focus efforts, making actions more effective.

SDG 14 identifies the environmental and social aspects affecting oceans, and is an excellent starting point for structuring an action plan. Companies can endorse external initiatives that promote sustainability and the protection of oceans, such as the FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the Global Aquaculture Alliance or the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation.

Protecting the oceans is a task that requires actions in several different areas. For example, promoting environmental best practices for aquaculture and fish farm suppliers is vital to ensure success at an environmental and business level. Research has shown that better environmental performance of farms can improve yield and economic results, which also translates into better living conditions and progress for local communities. If the supply chain relies on catching fish in open waters, then special attention must be paid to reduce the amount of by-catch, minimizing the impact on the natural environment and allowing oceans to maintain their natural balance.

Step 3: Get certified

Finally, making the company’s commitment known is important for all stakeholders, especially for customers. Being certified is one way for companies to show they are taking full responsibility for sustainability. There are different schemes that verify and attest for responsible sourcing, such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Chain of Custody Standard certification or the ASMI Chain of Custody. Companies can also aim at obtaining eco-labels, such as France’s Label Rouge. Obtaining these certifications requires constant auditing, which helps companies ensure that the supply chain is well managed and sustainable, working towards the achievement of SDG 14.

Ocean plastic pollution has become a topic of great concern; it was even the theme of this year’s Earth Day. There is still hope that our ocean will finally get the attention it deserves — but only if companies, governments and citizens begin to act now to protect and improve the health of our seas and coastal areas through sustainable use of marine resources.","Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013.

The ‘My Fiji Shark Initiative’ aims to promote the use of traditional knowledge, science and technology to advance sustainable management and marine conservation in the Pacific.



The initiative aims to change public perception of sharks, which Natasha Marosi, BAD, described as “beautiful, intelligent and dynamic creatures” with individual personalities. Marosi explained that sharks are globally threatened by habitat loss and overfishing, and “deserve all the help they can get.”

The initiative is all the more important as it targets SDG financing from – and with – the private sector.

The initiative is collaborating with the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, which is managed by BAD, to increase the profile of marine conservation in the Pacific through a shark adoption programme. The initiative enables sponsors to “adopt” individual sharks in their natural habitat. There are seven different tiers of public adoption levels, ranging from US$50 to US$10,000. Revenues generated from the initiative will support shark conservation measures, create new shark conservation and inshore fisheries management programmes, and build an independent Shark Lab to conduct shark conservation research in Fiji, among other activities.

UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji Country Director, Bakhodir Burkhanov, emphasized that the initiative “is all the more important as it targets SDG financing from – and with – the private sector.” He underscored the importance of private sector engagement and financial support in achieving the SDGs.

12.C.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels.

Progress to date

The breadth and ambition of SDG12, coupled with the relatively immature nature of some of the metrics used to assess levels of sustainable consumption and production, makes analysing progress more difficult than is the case for most of the SDGs.

However, what metrics are available point to a worrying picture. The UN's most recent progress report starts with the blunt assessment: ""Decoupling economic growth from resource use has been challenging.""

The report cites overarching figures for domestic material consumption (DMC) which gives an indication of materials used in production processes within an economy. Globally DMC per unit of GDP rose from 1.29kg to 1.41kg per dollar of GDP between 2000 and 2015, indicating more materials are required to produce a unit of output than was the case at the turn of the century. Total DMC also rose between 2000 and 2010, climbing from 48.7 billion tons to 71.0 billion tons, driven in large part by the rapid expansion of manufacturing-reliant emerging economies. The UN warned these trends will have ""consequences in terms of both resource pressures and associated environmental impacts"".

National governments are taking steps to tackle air, water and soil pollution, enhance resource efficiency, reduce food waste, boost recycling rates, and encourage corporate sustainability reporting. But progress remains extremely varied and even in some countries where recycling infrastructure is well established, such as the UK, efforts to improve recycling rates and reduce food waste have stalled in recent years.

Moreover, many countries are yet to enact any effective production and consumption policies. The UN progress report reveals that as of 2018 71 countries and the EU have formally reported on macro-policies, regulatory, voluntary or economic instruments that support the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In total 109 countries are thought to have or had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. But that still leaves just under half the world's nations with no such policies.

Further evidence of the patchwork nature of global efforts to encourage more sustainable consumption and production are found in the levels of compliance with international environmental agreements.

The Paris Agreement may have been backed by every country (even if the US is now planning to quit the accord) and the Montreal Protocol covering ozone damaging gases has a 100 per cent compliance rate. But the Rotterdam Convention covering the use of hazardous chemicals and pesticides only has a 71 per cent compliance rate, despite being enacted in 2004. Again, the US has refused to ratify the agreement.

Backing for the Basel Convention on the movement of hazardous waste and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is worse still, with 57 per cent and 51 per cent compliance, respectively.

Relatively few governments have moved beyond lip service towards sustainable consumption and production and many are yet to engage with the issue at all at any meaningful level.

""Achieving Goal 12 requires a strong national framework for sustainable consumption and production that is integrated into national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour, together with adherence to international norms on the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes,"" the UN states. The problem is even those countries and businesses with the most advanced environmental governance systems and strategies are struggling to develop truly sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Business implications

The potential implications for businesses of SDG12 are both enormous in their scale and reach, and extremely difficult to track.

Take the overarching goal and its pledge to ""ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"". That implies an end to unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Followed through to its logical extreme, that's a huge commitment. It suggests policies to actively pursue an end to the consumption of a whole raft of products and industries that are to all intents and purposes unsustainable in their current form, alongside the radical reform of unsustainable production techniques that have dominated some sectors for centuries. It raises huge questions about the very nature of consumer-led economies and the long term viability of profits generated from endlessly increased consumption.

It is easy to dismiss the possibility of sustainable consumption policies. After all, progress to date against SDG12 has been limited and there are few, if any, governments that have secured and retained power on a platform of 'consume less'.

But at the same time it would be wrong to reject the possibility out of hand. Savvy businesses are already responding to the trend towards dematerialised products, services, and experiences, beloved of millennial consumers. Meanwhile, the global push to slash the use of plastic straws and curb the market for disposable coffee cups has shown how once it gains traction interest in sustainable consumption can destroy entire markets. Speculation continues to mount over whether or not some martkets have reached 'peak car', as car-sharing and other transport services become mainstream.

At the same time, sustainable production patterns are on the agenda of many governments and businesses, as a growing number of leaders recognise how the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resource security necessitates more circular material flows and efficient production practices. If governments really do implement ambitious 10 year frameworks for delivering sustainable consumption and production then businesses are likely to be impacted at all levels. The achievement of ""sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources"" implies a genuine revolution in resource use and business models globally.

More specifically, SDG12 may at times feel like a holding pen for a raft of targets that could not be fitted in under the other goals, but many of those targets have still have huge direct business implications.

For example, the target to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030 is bracingly specific and suggests much more ambitious food waste policies will have to be enacted that will affect the entire global food industry.

Similarly, the pledge to renew efforts to bring more countries under the auspices of hazardous chemicals conventions and ""substantially"" reduce waste levels and boost recycling rates implies significantly more ambitious waste policies will be introduced in the coming years.

More broadly the promise to encourage more companies to report on their sustainability performance will provide yet more momentum behind the calls for more mandatory reporting rules, while the pledge to boost education around sustainability issues should further increase public interest in corporate responsibility. Promoting more sustainable public procurement practices should create major new markets for green businesses.

Finally, the target to rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies may be a sub-target and may echo largely ignored G20 promises to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but if enacted such a move would represent one of the simplest and most effective measures for curtailing pollution and boosting clean energy investment.

Business risks

The business risks associated with SDG12 are considerable. The continuation of unsustainable consumption and production patterns is, by definition, unsustainable. Inefficient resource flows will make meeting other SDGs covering poverty eradication and climate change, to give just two examples, much harder if not impossible to meet. At the same time investors and business leaders are already concerned about resource insecurity, commodity price volatility, and various industries that could be approaching environmental limits. A failure to accelerate the development of more sustainable consumption and production models will only amplify these concerns.

On the flip side, enacting sustainable consumption and production policies will create losers and winners, with some industries potentially facing an existential crisis. Large parts of industries such as 'fast fashion', plastics and packaging, consumer technology, food, and chemicals are yet to wrestle with products and business models that are based on linear resource flows and arguably damaging levels of highly inefficient consumption.

Some countries are beginning to consider bolder action in these areas, with material taxes, re-use and recycling incentive schemes, and outright bans on certain products all firmly under discussion. Businesses that fail to adapt to this reality will face major pressure on revenues, as well as continued reputational risks.

Chemicals regulations will inevitably tighten over the coming decade, along with public acceptance of products that are perceived to be environmentally damaging - a trend that could lead to major disruption to global supply chains.

A concerted global effort to promote better corporate sustainability strategies and more standardised reporting will create new regulatory and reputational risks, as well as increased pressure, for those businesses that are yet to develop credible sustainability strategies. The trend is also likely to start to extend down the business supply chain to take in small and medium sized enterprises.

Any phase out of fossil fuel subsidies would introduce significant risks for the energy and transport sectors, especially as the cost of clean tech alternatives continues to fall.

Business opportunities

As the UN's progress report makes clear, the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns remains at a fledgling stage. However, there are businesses and governments that are starting to engage with the concept and recognise the commercial and economic opportunities it can offer.

For example, a growing number of progressive businesses, especially in the retail and technology space, are pioneering new service-based or circular economy-style products, extending product life, encouraging re-use, and ensuring recycling occurs. From car sharing and leasing models to repairable and upgradable gadgets or clothes that are designed for years, not months, some businesses are opening up new revenue streams through more sustainable consumption models.

At the same time, many businesses are starting to recognise that higher levels of resource efficiency may require investment in improved design and better materials, but they can also deliver lower costs and improved resource security in the long run. Again, whole new industries are opening up for businesses that can deliver more efficient and durable materials or ensure materials are reused at the end of their original life.

Similarly, efforts to tackle food waste promise massive cost and greenhouse gas emissions savings and as such a new international business-led coalition has already been launched to advance best practices around the world under the banner Champions 12.3.

Similarly, the pledge to advance sustainable tourism strategies can only benefit an industry that is set to face significant environmental and policy challenges in the coming decades.

More generally, research has repeatedly shown that the adoption of effective corporate sustainability strategies and reporting can often lead to improved financial performance, reputational gains, better productivity, and lower risk profiles for investors. For those businesses already embracing such strategies the creation of a more level playing field where rivals are also required to disclose their sustainability performance can only help both them and their investors.

More public awareness amongst citizens of sustainable development and ""lifestyles in harmony with nature"" can only help drive the growth of green business and clean tech markets. Meanwhile, improved chemicals and hazardous waste regulations will serve to reduce environmental risks for all businesses. Any rebalancing of global energy markets caused by the removal of fossil fuel subsidies would boost clean energy markets and mobilise increased investment in energy efficiency.

By SHAZNI ONG / Pic By MUHD AMIN NAHARUL

HSBC Amanah Malaysia Bhd has launched the world’s first United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) sukuk, reflecting its commitment to financing projects that benefit communities and the environment.

The landmark sukuk will be the first ever benchmark sustainable sukuk by a financial institution that will be used to support eligible businesses in any of HSBC’s selected seven UN SDGs.

HSBC Amanah said in a statement yesterday that the sukuk is the second SDG issuance from a HSBC entity globally, following HSBC Group’s US$1 billion (RM4.14 billion) SDG Bond in 2017, in line with the group’s commitment to provide US$100 billion in sustainable financing and investment by 2025.

HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd group GM and CEO Stuart Milne said the sukuk is the world’s first benchmark sustainable sukuk by a financial institution referencing the UN SDGs as use of proceeds. As such, it also is a landmark in the ringgit and global sukuk market.

“HSBC has always been at the forefront of innovation in Islamic financing, having structured and lead managed numerous award winning landmark sukuk transactions on behalf of our clients.

“The issuance by HSBC Amanah demonstrates our continued commitment to the government of Malaysia’s efforts to promote Malaysia as an Islamic finance hub and is a strong testament to HSBC’s leadership in sustainable financing,” Milne said.

The launch came following an announcement made by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) yesterday on two new tools to facilitate the practical adoption of Value-Based Intermediation (VBI), namely the VBI Impact Assessment Framework and the VBI Scorecard.

HSBC Amanah CEO Arsalaan Ahmed said the issuance is also in line with the newly developed VBI initiative championed by BNM, which seeks to shift the focus of the Islamic finance industry to integrate environmental and social tenets into banking activities.

“We are pleased with this issuance that is aimed at starting a conversation in Islamic banking around SDGs and thus supporting VBI.

“This successful issuance also demonstrates our continued leadership in sukuk and contribution to the development of Shariah-compliant debt capital markets,” he said.

On Sept 20, 2018, HSBC Amanah priced an offering of RM500 million for a senior unsecured fixed rate SDG sukuk, due in 2023, from its existing multi-currency sukuk programme of RM3 billion.

The sukuk is rated AAA by RAM Rating Services Bhd and the proceeds will be utilised for working capital in the ordinary course of HSBC Amanah’s Islamic banking businesses, to finance eligible businesses and projects in accordance with the HSBC SDG Bond Framework.

HSBC Amanah, RHB Islamic Bank Bhd and Maybank Investment Bank Bhd acted as joint lead managers on this transaction, while HSBC Amanah acted as both the sole lead arranger and SDG structuring advisor.

The offering received strong investor demand, with final orderbook in excess of RM1.4 billion and a bid to cover a ratio of 2.85 times from 25 accounts across government agencies and pension funds (51%), financial institutions (31%), insurance companies (9%), asset managers (8%) and corporates (1%).

The sukuk is priced at the tight end of the final price guidance at a fixed profit rate of 4.3% per annum from an initial price guidance of 4.3%-4.4%.

This transaction represents the lowest coupon for a five-year nongovernmental guaranteed sukuk/ bond in the ringgit market in 2018 to date.

It is also the tightest spread over the benchmark Malaysian Government Securities for a financial institution since 2013 and for an Islamic bank in the ringgit market since HSBC Amanah’s inaugural ringgit sukuk in 2012.

The sukuk was issued based on the existing HSBC Group SDG Bond Framework and the proceeds will be used to support projects contributing towards the selected UN SDGs, namely Good Health and WellBeing (SDG 3), Qua-lity Education (SDG 4), Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

UN Development Programme (UNDP) administrator Achim Steiner said UNDP welcomes HSBC’s commitment to using funds raised in the capital market to invest in the SDGs.

“A world first, HSBC’s pioneering ‘SDG sukuk’ is a prime example of how to create innovative financing for the goals, and marks a milestone in aligning Islamic finance with the SDGs.

“UNDP is growing its work in this exciting area, working both with the private sector and government stakeholders,” he said.","The landmark sukuk will be the first ever benchmark sustainable sukuk by a financial institution that will be used to support eligible businesses in any of HSBC’s selected seven UN SDGs.

229,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-first-man-ryan-gosling-and-damien-chazelle-shoot-for-the-moon,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘First Man’: Ryan Gosling and Damien Chazelle Shoot for the Moon,"The La La Land filmmakers reunite to explore the private life of Neil Armstrong and the triumphs and tragedies of the space race.

Editor's Note: This review was originally posted on Oct. 10, 2018.

No matter what, somebody was going to go down in the history books as the first man to set foot on the moon. If it hadn’t been Neil Armstrong, it might have been Jim Lovell; if it hadn’t been an American, it would have been a Russian.

First Man makes the case that the man who actually went down in the history books was a man, if not the man, who cared more about the endeavor for its own sake than about who would go down in the history books.

But it also suggests that, no matter who wound up taking that first step on an alien world, that giant leap for mankind would also be one small step for a man no bigger on the inside than any of us.

Armstrong certainly had the right stuff, including the ability to stay cool in the face of an unfolding crisis that could have fatal consequences in seconds and figure out the right thing to do.

In one way that first footstep in the dust on the lunar surface represents all of humanity, and the U.S. flag planted by Armstrong (seen in a number of shots, belying the controversy over the omission of its actual planting) represents the nation that won this climatic chapter in the space race.

But it was not a paradigm or archetype who took that step or planted that flag. It was a fallible, wounded individual with personal baggage he couldn’t leave behind, even on a trip to the moon.

First Man is Damien Chazelle’s third film in a row about special individuals whose quest to achieve great things is linked to emotional isolation from others.

Chazelle won the Best Director Academy Award in 2017 for La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as creative souls and lovers who ultimately achieve their dreams only after breaking up. His prior film, Whiplash, was about a young drummer who breaks up with his girlfriend in order to focus on his passion and an abusive teacher, played by J.K. Simmons (who won the supporting actor Oscar for the role), who terrorizes his students in order to push the truly talented to greatness.

In this telling of the life of Neil Armstrong, which reunites Chazelle with Gosling in the lead role, the filmmaker has an iconic American incarnation of his favorite theme.

Following James R. Hansen’s official biography First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, on which it is based, Chazelle’s film finds a key turning point in Armstrong’s life in the devastating loss of his 2-year-old daughter, Karen, to an inoperable brain tumor.

The loss of a child can have an alienating effect on a husband and wife who process trauma and grief differently. Following a theory about presidents who lost children, Hansen suggests that Karen’s death may have helped to spur Armstrong to dedicate himself to an arena far from home and hearth.

For Chazelle, Armstrong’s quest may be for transcendence, or at least transformation. A harrowing opening sequence begins in medias res with Armstrong piloting an X-15 so close to the edge of space that he has trouble returning to Earth.

Still, he recalls that experience with wonder, even reverence, when being interviewed for the astronaut program and asked about the value of making the journey to the moon. On Earth, he says, the atmosphere that surrounds us seems vast, but from the edge of space, the Earth’s blanket of air seems thin and insubstantial.

From this perspective, the point of going to the moon is not what we learn about the moon, but what we learn about our place in the universe.

As an actor, Gosling has charisma to burn — a quality he has to submerge to play the reserved, understated Armstrong. Yet unlike his muted last role, playing a docile replicant in Blade Runner 2049, here Gosling bristles with intelligence and purpose, not to mention an occasional glint of humor.

His Armstrong isn’t one to suffer fools or to give people what they want. How did it feel to be selected to command the Apollo 11 mission? “I was pleased,” Armstrong tells the press, and rewording the question elicits no more quotation-working response.

Fortunately for the press, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (Corey Stoll) is more than willing to play to the cameras. Aldrin comes off as a bit of a brute; after one callous remark, he adds defensively, “I’m just saying what you’re thinking.” Armstrong’s laconic retort: “Well, maybe you shouldn’t!”

Claire Foy (The Crown) is well-matched with Gosling as Armstrong’s wife, Janet, who married him in the hope of finding stability and remains supportive of him to the end, but can stand up to him — or his NASA superiors — when necessary. The emotional connection between them is potent even when it is strained.

First Man effectively evokes the urgency of the space race, from the demoralizing frustration at every new milestone the Soviets reached before the United States to the thrill of victory when the U.S. crossed a line first.

We also feel acutely the vulnerability of the astronauts strapping themselves into claustrophobically confined spaces of immensely powerful engines that could easily kill them, and do kill some.

Janet’s angry remark about NASA being “a bunch of boys making models out of balsa wood” rings true because we see — and feel — how treacherous the technology can be.

Following one particularly devastating loss, Armstrong doggedly tells Bob Gilruth, the first director of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center, “We’ve got to fail down here so we don’t fail up there.” At what cost? Gilruth asks. “It’s a little bit late for that question, isn’t it, sir?” is Armstrong’s angry reply.

The possibility of failure looms so large that we see the White House has prepared a statement for the public in the event that the Apollo 11 crew don’t make the return trip. The air of foreboding Chazelle creates at the start of the mission almost makes us feel we’re watching the astronauts go to their deaths.

Not all of Chazelle’s choices work so well. Just as he undermined the big musical sequences in La La Land with his insistence on shooting them in showy single takes, here he relies so much on shaky handheld camerawork and extreme close-ups, even in ordinary quiet moments, that it becomes tiresome.

Yet the climactic sequence on the moon is heart-stopping in its stillness and austere splendor, elevating the film from excellence to near greatness. I’m not sure the words “magnificent desolation” have ever been more evocatively put to film than here. Everything else seems to recede — for a time.

That includes, for me, the flag-planting kerfuffle. There is a crucial moment on the moon, the culmination of one of the film’s central themes, that would arguably have been undermined by a flag-planting scene. Aldrin, in that news conference, jokes about his wife slipping him jewelry that she hopes he will bring to the moon and leave there. “What man wouldn’t want to give his wife bragging rights?” he asks rhetorically. When it comes to the point, though, more than bragging rights are in play.

First Man is ultimately more about the “man” than the “first.” It’s the story of a dedicated engineer and a gifted pilot who knew and accepted that his commitment to the program and the goal might cost him his life. Above all, though, it’s the story of a fragile human being who was never the same after a defining tragedy — who loved his daughter to the moon and back.

236,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-establishes-17-academic-impact-hubs-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Establishes 17 Academic Impact Hubs for SDGs,"24 October 2018: The UN has identified 17 universities around the world that will serve as ‘Academic Impact’ Hubs for each of the 17 SDGs. Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

237,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/inclusive-wealth-report-2018-warns-growth-comes-at-environmental-cost/,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Inclusive Wealth Report 2018 Warns Growth Comes at Environmental Cost,"26 November 2018: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and partners released preliminary findings from the ‘Inclusive Wealth Report 2018,’ which aims to evaluate and report on a country’s wealth and well-being. The report finds that, for many countries, increases in overall global wealth come at the expense of environmental assets, including biodiversity, forests, clean air and water.

The Inclusive Wealth Report ranks 140 countries using the Inclusive Wealth Index, a tool that assesses a country’s ability to “look after its wealth in a way that is sustainable and safeguards its future generations.” The report focuses on stocks of natural (forests, agricultural land, rivers and estuaries, the atmosphere and the oceans), human (aptitude, education, knowledge and skills) and manufactured (buildings, equipment, machines and roads) capital to measure inclusive wealth as an alternative to using gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of a country’s wealth, arguing that GDP measures only the size of a country’s economy without considering its underlying asset base.

If wealth increases as governments implement the SDGs, the Goals will be sustainable, but if wealth declines as governments try to meet the SDGs, the Goals should be considered unsustainable.

More than one-third of the 140 countries ranked in the report’s Inclusive Wealth Index had increased their GDP since 1998, but experienced a decline in their inclusive wealth per head. Further, only 81 of the 140 countries analyzed are on a sustainable path. The top ten performers on the basis of per capita inclusive wealth for 1992-2014 are the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malta, Latvia, Ireland, Moldova, Estonia, Mauritius, Lithuania and Portugal. Fifteen countries are assessed as unsustainable by inclusive wealth per capita, when adjusted for carbon damage and oil capital gains. These are Bulgaria, Congo, Gabon, the Gambia, Greece, Croatia, Haiti, Jamaica, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Latvia, the Sudan, Serbia, Syria, Ukraine and Viet Nam.

Carbon damage as a share of inclusive wealth “produces a stronger effect on small countries,” the report finds, because smaller countries tend to be too small to absorb such shocks. The report further finds that carbon damage is “relatively large” in high-income countries, such as Germany, France, the UK and the US, among others.

The report also considers the relationship between inclusive wealth and the SDGs, arguing that governments need to have a way to check whether or not the economic measures they take to meet the SDGs jeopardize the sustainability of the Goals. The report suggests that, if wealth increases as governments implement the SDGs, the Goals will be sustainable, but if wealth declines as governments try to meet the SDGs, the Goals should be considered unsustainable. The report argues that the Inclusive Wealth Index allows policymakers to assess whether or not enacted policies are sustainable, and will allow them to make decisions on how to best manage their assets.

UNEP will release the full report in the coming weeks.

238,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-private-sector-action-blended-finance-for-ldcs/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Private Sector Action, Blended Finance for LDCs","With a recent IPCC report calling for “unprecedented” societal transitions and a US government report on national climate impacts projecting major reversals to economic and social progress, this brief looks at the kind of action that can deliver the change needed, and the actors that are poised to have such impacts. Among these actors are private companies that are taking corporate sustainability reporting more seriously and investors with an eye on delivering sustainable development.



This brief starts with recent news on private sector actions, and ends with snapshots of blended finance and entrepreneurship in least developed countries (LDCs).

An article by Tony Wines on Eco-Business argues that investors and businesses—which “have the ability to act faster and more efficiently than public institutions”—may have the best chance of averting climate change. Wines emphasizes the rapid uptake of environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration in investors’ strategies, noting that such issues can affect companies’ performance and reputation. However, he acknowledges that there is “little evidence of integrated reporting targeted at investor audiences,” and thus highlights the need for businesses’ alignment with global frameworks such as the SDGs, which offer a more standardized language for stakeholders across the climate, development and financial spaces.

Further on business alignment with the SDGs, Trucost, part of S&P Global, has developed an SDG Evaluation Tool, which helps businesses identify “SDG-aligned business revenue,” increase transparency, inform sustainable growth strategies and guard against risk. According to a publication by Trucost, the tool works by mapping SDG exposure (risk) across a company’s value chain, evaluating the company’s efforts to manage and mitigate its exposure, and assessing the positive impacts created by the company through its products, services, charitable activities, and other societal contributions in line with the SDGs. In its inaugural application, the methodology was applied to 13 company participants and 21 peers from the technology, financial services, utilities and manufacturing sectors. Findings show that nearly 87% of companies’ revenues have the potential to be SDG-aligned. The report was launched at an event held on 5 November 2018 and accompanied by a news release.

Participants at the 2018 Global Corporate Sustainability Forum discussed how SDG achievement can help sustain competitiveness, shared best practices in implementing SDGs vis-à-vis corporate responsibility initiatives, and discussed linking international initiatives to local actions. The Forum took place from 22-23 November 2018, in Taipei, Taiwan. Taiwan has “entered an era of socially responsible investment” according to Yung-Shuen Shen, Secretary General of the Taiwan Academy of Corporate Sustainability, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) encourages Taiwanese companies to adopt Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as a step towards enhancing sustainability, notes Rebecca Chen of the TWSE.

Such steps are representative of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific region, where corporate sustainability and ESG reporting is rapidly increasing, thereby improving transparency and shining a light on companies’ contributions to or detractions from climate action and sustainable development. An article on Sustainable Brands notes the overarching importance of disclosure—particularly on climate change—to investors, who want to know how companies are managing their exposure to climate risks. It offers the example of Ørsted, an energy company headquartered in Denmark, to guide how climate-related financial disclosure can both increase resilience and examine new opportunities.

To further increase alignment in the corporate reporting landscape, GRI is undertaking a joint project to address “reporting fatigue” caused by multiple or overlapping directives, harmonize definitions and terminology, and simplify corporate reporting such that it becomes more useful and effective. As noted in a GRI press release, the project will be conducted in the context of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue, and was launched during the Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summit in London, UK, as well as in Sydney, Australia during the World Congress of Accountants 2018.

Only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged today is from private sector investors.

Also looking at actors that can leverage private sector investment to the SDGs and the needed climate transitions, Convergence released a data brief that calculates the leverage ratios for a sample of blended finance funds. While leverage ratios must be differentiated according to the conditions of the transaction—including the target sector, country, and impact outcomes—on average, blended finance funds leverage US$4 of commercial capital for every dollar of concessional capital. However, the brief notes that only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged is from private sector investors, with the majority coming from development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs).

For those new to the term, ‘blended finance,’ Convergence explains it as the use of capital from public or philanthropic sources to increase private sector investment towards sustainable development, particularly in developing countries. Blended finance can take shape through a variety of transactions, including those with concessional development funding, impact bonds, or grant funding to support projects’ early stages or technical assistance facilities, among others. Convergence released ‘The State of Blended Finance 2018’ report in September of this year.

The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) released report titled, ‘Blended Finance in the Least Development Countries,’ which responds to limited evidence on where, how, why, and in which sectors blended approaches are being deployed in LDCs; the opportunities and challenges with blended finance strategies; and the conditions under which blended finance is most effective. The report comprises four sections: 1) applying blended finance in LDCs, which analyzes the latest financial data, notes barriers and discusses issues of development effectiveness; 2) country case studies from Africa and Asia; 3) guest pieces on a variety of SDG-relevant topics; and 4) the action agenda moving forward, which identifies five areas where action is needed form all stakeholders. The report was developed in collaboration with Convergence, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Southern Voice and UN Foundation.

A blog post relating to the report’s findings by Convergence’s Justice Johnston highlights that LDCs rely heavily on concessional financing, which comprises upwards of 60% of total external finance. It notes that weak enabling environments in LDCs act as deterrents to private investment and serve to increase the risk premiums. Additional project-specific barriers include limited credit histories and lack of market data, which lead investors to seek greater returns to offset increased risks. Thus, blended finance in LDCs may require greater proportions of concessional finance to attract commercial investment or demonstrate viability. Key sectors where blended finance holds promise in LDCs include energy, financial services and infrastructure, though Johnston underscores that in some cases, pure public financing remains the most suitable option. A UNCDF news release on the report is also available.

For those seeking to learn more on blended and private finance strategies, the OECD is hosting Private Finance for Sustainable Development (PF4SD) Week from 15-18 January 2019 at their Boulogne Conference Center in Paris, France. The week will kick off with the launch of a report titled, ‘The Impact Imperative for Financing Sustainable Development.’

On LDCs, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released ‘The Least Developed Countries Report 2018: Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation – Beyond Business as Usual.’ The report appraises the entrepreneurial landscape in the 47 LDCs, examines conditions for creating high-impact businesses, and identifies common structural features of LDCs’ economies that can hinder entrepreneurship. These include: lack of (or weak) institutions, insufficient infrastructure, limited finances and high registration costs, and elevated risks, as noted by the above Convergence blog. The report notes that self-employment constitutes the vast majority of entrepreneurship in LDCs, but laments that there is little capacity to innovate or grow, and thus calls for policies towards a renewed “developmental state” that brings in the private sector to “chart a clear path for development” through “mission-oriented investments.”

An UNCTAD press release consolidates the report’s key facts and figures on the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs, local entrepreneurship in global production systems, constraints to firms’ growth in LDCs, and current policy frameworks. Separately, comprehensive economic and social statistics on LDCs, compiled by UNCTAD are also available.

The 13 companies that participated in the inaugural application generated almost $233 billion of SDG-aligned business revenues in 2017; equivalent to 87% of their total revenues.

On September 25th 2015, more than 150 world leaders adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda.

Trucost, a leader in carbon and environmental data and risk analysis, developed the SDG Evaluation Tool to increase transparency and help market participants identify SDG-aligned business value and inform sustainable growth strategies.

The Trucost SDG Evaluation Tool provides a quantitative analysis of corporate performance on the SDGs across the value chain, from raw material inputs to product use and disposal, within the context of a company's geographic operations. The framework was developed to increase the accuracy of SDG reporting by quantifying both SDG-linked risks and opportunities faced by companies.

Libby Bernick, Managing Director and Global Head of Corporate Business, Trucost said, ""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions. We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

The SDGs can catalyze new ways to think about social and environmental issues. For example, corporate reporting and action on greenhouse gas emissions has increased exponentially in recent years, but SDG 13 Climate Action also highlights the importance of climate adaptation which is less commonly disclosed by companies.

Additional findings from the inaugural application of the Trucost SDG Evaluation include:

Regional considerations: Market participants need to assess SDGs with a regional lens, as many of the risks and opportunities are locally specific

Supply chain SDG risks are largely opaque; economic models provide a fast, efficient way to sleuth which are material issues, and where Sales in developing markets: Companies can create more positive contribution to the SDGs by accelerating sales in markets where the need is greatest; in many sectors, this often includes developing markets

Multiple companies, supported by an advisory panel of investment professionals, interest group representatives and academics, were part of the inaugural application of the Trucost SDG Evaluation Tool.

The Trucost SDG Tool inaugural group of companies included: Aguas Andinas, AMD, Arm, CLP Holdings, HP Inc, Iberdrola, Ingersoll Rand, Ørsted, ROCKWOOL Group, S&P Global, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc, Tarkett and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Advisory panel: American Chemistry Council, APG, Calvert Research and Management, Impax Asset Management LLC/Pax World Funds, London School of Economics, Nordic Investment Bank, PGGM, S&P Dow Jones Indices, UN Global Compact, and World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

240,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paris21-reports-on-international-support-to-statistics/,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,PARIS21 Reports on International Support to Statistics,"24 October 2018: The financing for the data agenda has gained visibility over the past five years, but only 56 of the 102 countries with statistical plans have secured adequate financing to implement them, according to a report prepared by PARIS21. In addition, it finds that available information on domestic support for statistics remains a challenge in many developing countries.



The 2018 edition of the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), issued annually by the Secretariat of the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21), aims to provide a full picture of international support to statistics. It identifies factors that are important in constructing well-financed national statistical systems, including: a high level of national political interest; donor alignment with government strategies; legal autonomy or giving legal status to national statistical offices (NSOs); the alignment of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs) with country development plans; and coordination between statistical stakeholders through regular inter-agency meetings. The report mainly provides information until 2016, and is based on “newly available data” from an annual donor survey, and the 2016 Creditor Reporting System (CRS) – the official source of information on aid commitments from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, and some multilateral organizations.

According to the report, support to statistics amounted to US$623 million in 2016, marking a 5% increase from 2015, and the share of official development assistance (ODA) focused on data and statistics was 0.33%. However, the overall amount of funding for data and statistics remains low, and support remains concentrated on certain countries, with the top 25 recipients receiving nearly half of the support dedicated to 165 countries. The top-ten support recipients for 2006-2016 were Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Vietnam.

The report indicates that a large share of global support to statistics continues to come from a very small number of providers. The top five providers of development cooperation in statistics are the World Bank, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Eurostat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which contributed 69% of total commitments in 2016. Also, based on a survey on Global Private Philanthropy for Development presented by the OECD in 2018, private philanthropy organizations are getting more involved in statistical development, the report says. Private foundations provided US$23.9 billion from 2013 to 2015, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the most significant of the foundations surveyed, providing 49% of total resources.

Only two of nine SIDS have their national strategy for statistical development fully funded and under implementation.

On areas benefiting the most from statistical support, the report outlines demographic and social statistics (28% of total commitments in 2016), adding that environmental and multi-sectoral statistics “reached a record level” with the adoption of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On gender, it notes that statistics are not prioritized in data collection, resources devoted to them remain “grossly inadequate,” and the three areas where statistical investments are more focused are: sexual and reproductive health and rights, eliminating violence against women, and women’s economic empowerment.

On regional allocations, the report indicates that: Africa received the largest share of statistical support with 56% in 2014-2016; the share of total statistical support committed to Latin America and the Caribbean increased from 5% to 8%, driven by several commitments to national censuses in the region; and the share of commitments received by Asia and Pacific fell by half, due to the fact that some large projects committed in 2013 were no longer included for the 2014-2016 period.

On small island developing States (SIDS), the report notes that commitments to SIDS remain low. It adds that most SIDS are lagging behind in terms of building statistical infrastructure and developing statistical planning, and only two out of nine SIDS have their national strategy for development of statistics fully funded and under implementation.

On fragile states, the report mentions that statistical systems have made progress in strengthening their statistical capacities, but a lack of resources and technical skills has persisted. The authors call for more commitments and long-term investment for strengthening systems and capacity development in contexts experiencing fragility to implement and monitor National Development Plans (NDPs), and the SDGs, and to fill sector-specific gaps in areas such as environmental and economic statistics.

In terms of international initiatives on supporting data and statistics, the report states that a new PARIS21 study is currently exploring the feasibility of setting up a Global Fund for Development Data, that could feed into the reflection regarding a funding framework to underpin the implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan. The report points to the creation of a Data for Development group within the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), to discuss data strategies for development and identify good data for development practices in areas such as financing, partnerships with donors and evaluating data interventions. It also mentions a collaboration on a gender statistics programme between PARIS21 and UN Women, within the framework of the Making Every Woman and Girl Count global flagship initiative.

PARIS21 is a global network of statisticians, policymakers, analysts, and development practitioners which facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision making, and coordinates donor support to statistics with the main objective to achieve national and international development goals and reduce poverty in low and middle-income countries. It was established by the UN, the European Commission, the OECD, the IMF, and the World Bank. Its Secretariat is hosted within the OECD’s Statistics and Data Directorate.

According to the publication’s findings, 679 of 1,146 cities inhabited by more than half a million people are vulnerable to cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions. Combined, these cities are home to 1.4 billion people – a third of the world’s population. The booklet draws on projections from DESA’s ‘World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision’ report, and notes the importance of understanding urbanization trends as being key to implementing SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The data booklet offers a definition for the term “city,” distinguishing between administrative boundaries, those delineated by “contiguous urban areas,” and broader metropolitan areas that feature a degree of economic and social interconnectivity. The means of defining a city, it stresses, affects the assessment of its population, with metropolitan areas being home to significantly larger numbers of people than the “city proper” as defined by an administrative boundary.

Nine of the ten cities projected to become megacities by 2030 are located in developing countries.

The publication notes that the world’s cities are growing in both size and number, with most megacities – defined as having more than 10 million inhabitants – being located in the global South. Nine of the ten cities projected to become megacities by 2030 are located in developing countries.

In a news release, lead author of the publication Danan Gu, DESA, emphasizes the importance of cities, noting that urban areas produce approximately three quarters of the world’s economic output. The study, he highlights, aims to better understand cities’ vulnerability, in order to both protect human life and limit economic and infrastructural damages from natural disasters. Key to doing so, he adds, is ensuring preparedness, good governance and resilient infrastructure.

However, these features are more commonly found in cities within high-income countries. Thus, with most of the world’s fastest growing cities being in Asia and Africa, the study reveals a gap, and a need to ensure that cities in developing regions are resilient to natural disasters. DESA’s press release points to a recent report by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) which finds that only one high-income territory in the past 20 years ranks in the top ten for economic losses as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).

They also welcomed a regional review report, which draws on data from countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of achievements toward the 2030 Agenda, among other sources. Participants highlighted the need for increasing investments in realizing reproductive rights and gender equality.

European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with a “triple burden” falling on middle-aged women.

The regional report presented by UNECE and UNFPA titled, ‘Fulfilling the Potential of Present and Future Generations,’ presents an overview of regional population trends, and highlights areas of stress requiring policy responses. For example, the authors note that European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with the largest portion of care falling on middle-aged women who often undertake a “triple burden” as they care for younger and older generations, while still remaining engaged in the labor force.

Other issues include low fertility, youth unemployment and complex migration movements, with negative net migration a feature of eastern Europe, while western countries experienced positive net migrant inflows. Unemployment, poverty and insufficient social protection are still issues for some UNECE Member States.

Speakers at the conference drew attention to gender inequalities in workforce participation, earnings, and access to leadership positions. They called for investing in human capital and creating enabling environments for stability, wellbeing and prosperity.

The report titled, ‘Energizing Finance: Understanding the Landscape 2018,’ highlights areas related to financing energy access that require urgent action to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). It notes that committed finance stands at only half of the US$52 billion required annually to achieve universal electricity access. The report warns that funding for clean cooking has declined, accounting for less than one percent of projected funding needed to stop the millions of deaths caused annually by traditional biomass cooking.

The report aims to help finance institutions and policymakers develop and implement strategies that can be scaled and refined to increase affordability and accessibility of clean and sustainable energy. It provides evidence that finance sources considered the most efficient for unlocking greater capital, such as concessional development finance, are decreasing rather than increasing. For example, concessional development finance for electrification decreased by 7 percent to US$4.8 billion.

Concessional development finance for electrification is decreasing.

According to the publication, for the second year in a row, finance committed across the 20 countries accounting for nearly 80 percent of those living without energy access went down. At the same time, finance for coal-powered energy has been on the rise, with annual commitments up from US$2.8 billion to US$6.8 billion.

Speaking about the report, Rachel Kyte, SEforALL CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, underscored the need for a strong project pipeline and sufficient levels of public investment to “crowd in private finance.”

Other key findings from the report include: off-grid solutions remain off-track; solar financing is increasing; two thirds of all electricity finance tracked was concentrated in South Asia, mainly in India; and investment favors non-residential customers.

The report calls for urgent action and recommends that:

international public financial institutions fulfill their commitments to close financing gaps for electricity access;

policymakers prioritize non-coal fired or fossil fuel power generation as part of their integrated energy planning and investment processes;

governments adopt integrated approaches to energy sector policy, planning and regulation; and

leaders, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, use a combination of policy, financial instruments and business model innovation to achieve “last mile access.”

According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day. But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.

Business has a vital role to play in ramping up action against poverty. From creating the jobs and opportunities that lead to sustainable incomes, to lobbying governments to introduce effective poverty-fighting economic policies, firms can make a real difference towards making poverty history, for good. ""Without the private sector, the global goals will not be realised,"" Lisa Kingo, CEO and executive director of the UN Global Compact, told attendees at the SDG Business Forum in New York earlier this year.

But with such a broad, ambitious goal, it is hard for companies to know where to start. BusinessGreen spoke to some of the world's leading experts on how businesses should practically address SDG1 through their own operations - here are their key recommendations.

1. Do no harm

It may be a guiding principle for medical professionals around the world, but the mantra 'do no harm' is also central to any successful business approach to the SDGs. To make sure that firms looking to tackle SDG1 don't roll back on progress in other areas - for example, by clearing rainforest to bring agricultural jobs to a region, at the expense of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions that could lead to worsening poverty down the line - businesses should start their SDG efforts by applying the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UNGC.

""If all companies subscribed to the 10 principles of the UN global compact we would already go a long way to delivering on the global goals,"" she says.

The 10 principles are effectively a checklist for running a good business. They include support and protection for human rights, effective abolition of child labour, a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, and a promise to work against corruption in any form. Adhering to these principles is the first step to ensuring all subsequent actions on the SDGs act as a positive force for sustainable development, rather than an inadvertent impediment to their aims.

2. Understand the problem - and find out which solutions work

Any number of factors conspire to lock people in poverty, from government corruption and conflict, to poor education and extreme weather. The first step to tackling poverty effectively is working out which of those factors are related to your business operations and how exactly you can address it, says Marika McCauley Sine, vice president for global human rights at Mars.

""Poverty is a manifestation of a lack of respect for rights, lack of the ability to manage environmental challenges and threats like climate change, low income and a range of other drivers,"" she says. ""The first step is understanding the barriers that people face to rising up out of poverty and reflecting on one's ability to impact those barriers.""

Mars started this process in its own operations in 2016, by taking a long look at its supply chain to work out where the pressure points are. Its Farmer Income Lab, which launched last year, then set about identifying proven strategies for alleviating poverty among smallholder farmers. ""That's been our brief and our focus for this first year of the Lab - what does work to enable farmers to increase their income?"" says McCauley Sine. ""It's been fascinating to begin to review the evidence base, to take a look at the landscape of what is actually out there in terms of evidence and begin to see what really does work, what people think works but actually may not, and to begin to identify some of the common factors that most successful programs out there share.""

Solving the poverty problem is often not as simple as bumping up the pay for those at the bottom of the ladder, she warns, and firms may need to prepare themselves for more radical change in how their business operates. ""Perhaps historically the business sector has approached the issue of poverty from a livelihood lens,"" she says. ""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains. I think Mars' view is that it is not enough. What we need to do is reflect deeply on the current realities that people face who are in poverty, who are touched in some way by the reach of our global value chains, and consider what real transformation looks like. And where there is poverty, challenging ourselves to go beyond incremental improvements to deliver real transformation"".

3. Don't plump for the obvious goal

If you're a renewable energy company, your first instinct on looking at the SDGs might be to think 'great, we are contributing to SDG 7 - clean and affordable energy - and that's our role in the SDGs sorted'.

Not so fast, says James Gomme, director of SDGs at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ""You need a robust analysis of all of the goals as your starting point, and not passing over anything in that initial scan,"" he says. ""You need to do that initial analysis and have that conversation internally, and perhaps with peers and stakeholders as well, around what SDGs can you really drive direct impact on through your operations and through your supply chain.""

You should only start to narrow down on the goals you want to focus on once that analysis is complete, he adds.

Companies assuming that SDG1 doesn't apply to them is one of the major reasons why it is ranked as a low-priority goal for the business community. But by doing a first broad sweep of all 17 Goals - and understanding how each one touches your business operations - SDG1 may not be so often neglected by the business community.

And don't be fooled into thinking SDG1 is one for governments rather than business because of the way it's written. WBCSD's Gomme advises firms to look past the ""developmental"" language - because there is a clear role for business in tackling poverty.

""All the text is written for governments, and it's written in UN language, and it's a case of understanding how that interacts with your business, and understanding what you can do on that agenda,"" he stresses. ""And the companies that understand that best and put time into interpreting that agenda for their business will be the companies that are ultimately able to leverage the opportunities that the SDGs represent.""

4. Work backwards

Mike Tuffrey, co-founder of sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship, says many corporates are making the mistake of assessing how their activities are already contributing to an SDG, rather than working out what is needed to help hit SDG1's specific ambitions.

Firms should look more closely at the gap between what is happening on the ground today, and where the SDG or its sub-target say we should be in 2030, he says. ""They are not working back on an individual goal from what's required to say 'what do we need to do?'""

It is worth remembering that although the headline SDGs are broad, the 169 sub-targets offer explicit detail on what's expected. SDG1, for example, has five sub-targets:

By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.

By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

To make a real impact on a goal, firms should understand the sub-targets and work backwards, to get a clear idea of the ambition gap that needs filling, Tuffrey concludes.

5. Harness your lobbying power

Tackling SDG1 doesn't necessarily mean flying in armies of volunteers to run resource-intensive projects on the ground - companies should not disregard their influence to change government and social policy, argues Oxfam's Matthew Spencer.

He points to the example of Myanmar, where in 2015 the government was proposing to create a minimum wage of US$2.60 per day for workers. Garment manufacturers in the country were proposing an opt-out for their industry, but after 30 European companies including Tesco and M&S wrote to the Myanmar government opposing the suggestion on the grounds that it would deter them from investing in the country, the government forced through the new base wage.

""That [letter] helped give the government confidence that they could go through with that sensible social protection, anti-poverty measure, and as a result 30,000 garment workers have benefited,"" Spencer says. ""So that's an example of business working to improve the conditions of the poorest in their supply chain.""

6. And if in doubt, start with the UN's four top actions

The UN Global Compact has helpfully identified for top business actions for SDG1, for firms still struggling to determine how best to play their part.

Karbassi explains: ""In the case of SDG1 we have four actions that we identify as business leading actions. The first one is the creation of secure and decent jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations.

""The second one is the empowerment of disadvantaged groups, particularly in terms of economic empowerment.

""Then we have the engagement of companies around their supply chain, and the ability to provide decent working conditions for employees around the supply chain"".

Finally the fourth action is around developing goods and services ""that would target vulnerable groups"" and grow the green economy. ""There's a whole market around that which is not fully taken advantage of,"" she says - pointing to products such as mobile banking applications, microloans, and home solar systems.","As things currently stand, the world is on track to miss the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which targets the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day.
But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.

246,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/seychelles-launches-first-blue-bond/,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Seychelles Launches First Blue Bond,"29 October 2018: Seychelles has launched a US$15 million blue bond to support sustainable fisheries and marine projects. Seychelles announced the bond at the fifth edition of the Our Ocean Conference.

According to the World Bank, a blue bond is an innovative financial instrument used to finance ocean and marine-based projects that have positive economic, environmental and climate benefits. The blue bond concept is inspired by the green bond concept. Examples of eligible activities include fisheries management plans, stock rebuilding, improved value chains, aquaculture development and promotion of sustainable practices and education awareness programmes.

The World Bank assisted Seychelles in developing the blue bond and in reaching out to Calvert Impact Capital, Nuveen and Prudential Financial, Inc. The Blue Grants Fund and Blue Investment Fund, managed by the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS) and Seychelles’ Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT), will provide grants and loans. The Seychelles blue bond is guaranteed by a US$5 million guarantee from the World Bank and a US$5 million concessional loan from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) that will partially cover interest payments for the bond.

The bond will assist Seychelles in safeguarding our oceans while we sustainably develop our blue economy.

Proceeds from the bond will support expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) to 30 percent of the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), improved governance of priority fisheries and development of the blue economy in Seychelles. The main beneficiaries of the bond are Seychellois who depend on marine resources and the ocean for their livelihoods, including artisanal and semi-industrial fisheries, tourism operators and operators engaged in seafood value chains, among others. The bond will also contribute to the World Bank’s South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Program (SWIOFish3), which supports countries in the region to increase economic benefits from their fisheries sectors while sustainably managing their fisheries.

Seychelles’ Vice President Vincent Meriton said the blue bond is part of an initiative that combines public and private investment to mobilize resources to empower local communities and businesses. Meriton emphasized the bond will assist Seychelles “in achieving a transition to sustainable fisheries and safeguarding our oceans while we sustainably develop our blue economy.”

The World Bank emphasized that the bond “demonstrates the potential for countries to harness capital markets for financing the sustainable use of marine resources.” The World Bank’s Vice President of Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck, said the Bank believes this sovereign blue bond “can serve as a model for other small island developing States and coastal countries,” and is a signal that investors are increasingly interested in supporting sustainable management and development of the world’s oceans.

The Our Ocean Conferences have resulted in over 1,200 concrete, measurable and tracked commitments in support of sustainable management of the world’s oceans. The 2018 Our Ocean Conference took place in Bali, Indonesia, from 29-30 October.

To the SCAN-tool

The SDG Climate Action Nexus tool (SCAN-tool) is designed to provide high-level guidance on how mitigation actions can impact achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It can support policy makers to achieve greater policy coherence and to improve the efficiency of implementation by providing them with an initial indication of which climate actions may impact -positively or negatively- specific SDG targets.



The SCAN-tool can also potentially inform the process of putting forward increasingly ambitious pledges of climate action, required every five years under the ambition mechanism of the Paris Agreement. A better understanding of how climate action can reinforce the achievement of SDG targets may increase countries’ confidence to put forward more ambitious NDCs and improve political buy-in.

Key findings:

A first overview of the results (see table below) highlights the following key findings:

In total, 886 linkages were identified between sector-specific actions and SDG targets, with a further 30 identified between general interventions and SDG targets. This important number of links highlights the opportunity and need to approach implementation in an integrated manner.

Synergies outweigh trade-offs for most of the SDGs (in fact, the majority (76%) of linkages identified in the tool are positive).

The SDG agenda in itself is extensive and complex, comprising a total of 167 targets under the 17 goal dimensions. In many cases the targets overlap or even duplicate, thus complicating their attribution to individual subsectors and mitigation actions. This complexity and inter-relatedness within the SDG agenda is difficult to capture in a simplified tool.

Many or perhaps all of the linkages are ultimately very context specific. To understand and manage the synergies and trade-offs, countries will need to undertake a systematic review of individual mitigation actions in their specific context. The SCAN-tool helps indicate where to start with that exercise.

Ms. Durant used her opening remarks to make a pitch of her own to the 12 entrepreneur finalists, who were readying to present their SDG-orientated business ideas to a panel of impact investors.

“You are the generation which can change your countries, the economy, and development strategy,” she said.

“We have to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. For that we need you. We need your energy and your creativity Business for businesses’ sake is not the message of the SDGs.”

“Meaningful and fair businesses, which are close to the people and planet, are the businesses we need – and that is what you will start.”

“You have already captured the essence of the SDGs by incorporating climate and the environment, social and economic factors into your business models.”

“Global Entrepreneurs Week is a wonderful tool to mobilize not only you but one million people from 100 countries on six continents. UNCTAD is proud of have been at the roots of this initiative.”

An energetic connection

The winning scale-up was born with a meeting between indigenous Guayusa leaf producers in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and Mr. Santander and his business partner Juan David Gomez, who wanted to harness the energy properties of the leaf, but with community involvement.

Now, 150 small-scale Amazonian growers are making the first natural, organic energy tea, Waykana, from ancestral Guayusa leaves.

The project generates income and boosts development in the community.

Mr. Santander said he would share his prize money with the growers to help them establish a grower’s association and protect them as Waykana expands.

“It feels amazing to have won. We have been working on the project at a crazy speed, non-stop for three years. We can feel how it is now taking off,” he said.

“The grant means the world, not only to our company, and Ecuador, but to our growers and the Guayusa tea industry. With the support of the international community we aim to make Guayusa famous all over the world.”

“We plan to allocate this money wisely into better organizing and strengthening the relationship with the small-scale growers.”

Just over a quarter (28%) of businesses have set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help them measure and disclose their positive contributions towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite repeated warnings that corporate action has been slow and weak.

That is a key conclusion of a new report from professional services giant PwC, which has revealed the results of a survey of 700 corporates on SDG action.

Published today (26 November), the firm’s SDG reporting challenge report shows that almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses have mentioned the Global Goals in their annual corporate or sustainability reports this year – a 10% increase since 2017.

Half of the companies, meanwhile, claimed they had identified “priority” SDGs – areas where their firm or sector could maximise their positive impact.

However, the report concludes that concrete measures for SDG action and integration remain “elusive” for the majority of businesses, with an inability to identify ambitious or long-term goals cited as a key barrier.

Specifically, it notes that only 27% of corporate survey respondents mention the SDGs as part of their business or sustainability strategy in annual reports, and that just 19% of chief executive or chair statements in annual reports mention the 17 Goals.

“The increase in companies indicating the SDGs challenge in their reporting is a positive sign of engagement that will increasingly need to be backed by strategies which look beyond business as usual at the opportunities being presented,” PwC’s global sustainability reporting and assurance lead Alan McGill said.

“Success with the SDGs depends on making them a central part of business strategy. What is planned for, measured and reported in public filing is a good indicator of what is embedded in a businesses’ strategy and priorities.”

Ambition or action?

The findings of the new report echo those made by PwC at the start of the year, when the firm surveyed 500 companies across 17 countries on similar issues.

In that survey, PwC found that most respondents were failing to explicitly make the connection between the 17 Goals and 169 targets, placing SDG logos into their reports as “lip service” rather than working to convert stakeholder aspiration into corporate action.

Similarly, sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship has warned that tangible plans and partnerships on the global goals have stalled, while the UN Global Compact has concluded that the private sector is failing to follow through on commitments.

The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) claims that Britain is only performing well on 24% of targets considered relevant to the domestic delivery of the Goals. This finding has spurred the UK Government to launch its first review into business performance against the SDGs earlier this year.

“While there is a clear appetite for embracing the SDGs, many organisations still lack the strategy, tools and culture needed to transform those commitments into tangible business actions,” PwC’s global SDGs lead Louise Scott added.

“For every one of the 17 Goals, there are pressing real-world issues that directly impact the world of business.”

In partnership with consultancy firm Ditto Sustainability, edie recently published an SDG “blueprint” providing clear, practical steps that can be taken to embed the Global Goals in business strategies. You can download that document by clicking here.

250,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/baseline-report-urges-coherent-efforts-to-realize-sdg-5-all-sdgs-in-asia-pacific/,"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Baseline Report Urges Coherent Efforts to Realize SDG 5, All SDGs in Asia-Pacific","October 2018: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and UN Women have released a publication examining gender equality and the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific. The report establishes a baseline for governments and policymakers to monitor and accelerate progress towards gender equality commitments in the SDGs.

In June 2016, the ADB and UN Women signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen their cooperation and partnership to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific. The baseline report reflects the high-level commitment of both organizations to support regional cooperation and national efforts to accelerate progress towards gender equality and gender-responsive SDG implementation.

The publication titled, ‘Gender Equality and the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: Baseline and pathways for transformative change by 2030,’ argues that gender equality should be addressed both in its own right and as a catalyst of progress across all the SDGs. According to the report, inequalities for women and girls “remain stark” across the region on a broad range of indicators: the region has high levels of violence against women and harmful practices; women have poor access to quality sexual and reproductive health services; there are low levels of women in decision-making; a disproportionate share of women engage in vulnerable work; and women bear an unequal share of unpaid care work.

The report focuses on four policy areas, which the authors say highlight the potential of gender equality to catalyze change across the SDGs. On realizing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), the report emphasizes the synergies and interlinkages between realizing these rights and achieving other SDGs. As an illustration, fewer unplanned pregnancies, greater family savings and productivity could improve household living standards (SDG 1), nutrition (SDG 2), maternal and child health (SGD 3), and school attendance (SDG 4), all of which could potentially catalyze greater benefits for communities and the economy.

On recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid care and domestic work, the report highlights how redistributing women’s disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work can unleash their economic potential and enhance other development outcomes, including increased time for women to participate in education (SDG 4), politics and leadership (SDG 5), engage in decent work and economic opportunities (SDG 8) and engage in self-care and leisure activities. Unpaid care and domestic work are a significant challenge for women in Asia-Pacific, according to the report, which finds that over 20% of women in the region identify work-family balance as a key challenge to participation in the labor force. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, 83% and 73% of women say responsibility for domestic work is the primary reason they do not engage in paid work. The report also highlights how demographic changes, such as people living longer, increases the demand for care, underscoring the importance of investing in accessible, affordable and quality services for child, disability and elderly care.

On eliminating violence against women and girls, the authors explain that addressing this would increase women’s income (SDG 1), opportunities to complete education (SDG 4) and participation in paid employment (SDG 8). Some of the highest rates of violence globally are in the Pacific, according to the report, which recommends tackling entrenched attitudes and social norms around gender roles.

On the fourth policy area, empowering women to build climate resilience and reduce disaster risks, the report states that women’s mortality rates in major disasters in the region are much higher than men’s, citing examples from Indonesia and the Solomon Islands. The report finds that women and girls are especially dependent on climate-sensitive natural resources for their livelihoods (SDG 1), are over-represented among food-insecure populations (SDG 2), have less capacity to cope with the adverse climate impacts on water quality and availability (SDG 6) and on coastal and marine resources (SDG 14), including as a result of their lack of access and control over land and other productive resources (SDG 5). Despite these disadvantages, the report emphasizes that women can be important agents of change and play a key role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The report recommends: more robust data and evidence for better planning, monitoring and implementation of climate action; empowerment of women as key actors in tackling climate change, such as through involvement in sustainable land and ecosystem management and development of early warning systems; and integration of gender perspectives into climate finance.

The report also outlines the data availability for gender-related SDG indicators used in the report, noting that that only 26% are available for more than two-thirds of the countries or territories in Asia-Pacific, and 41% of indicators have no relevant regional data. Further, only three of the 14 official indicators for SDG 5 (gender equality) are classified as ‘Tier 1,’ meaning that data is regularly produced by countries with regional methodologies, and regional data is only available for one of these indicators. The report concludes that “significant investment is needed to monitor gender equality in the SDGs.” The authors call for “heightened urgency” to improve production and use of gender statistics to ensure “evidence-based SDG localization.”

The report concludes with key recommendations to advance a gender-responsive approach to SDG monitoring and implementation, such as: removing discrimination from legal frameworks and promoting change in social norms; promoting gender-responsive institutions and localization to mainstream and prioritize gender equality across all policy sectors; ensuring women’s active and equal participation, representation and leadership at all levels; and increasing financing and investment, including by making gender a priority in domestic resource mobilization.

Including representatives from more than 20 developing countries, this meeting saw a major shift in focus of GAML–from development and refinement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) indicators toward implementation.

Esther Care Former Brookings Expert R Ramya Vivekanandan Senior Education Specialist, Learning Assessment Systems - GPE Secretariat

UIS plays a critical role in the Education 2030 Agenda by producing cross-nationally comparable education data and works with partners to develop new indicators, methodologies, statistical approaches, and monitoring tools to better assess progress toward international education targets. It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

A primer on the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML)

GAML was convened by the UIS in early 2016 to provide concrete solutions to develop new indicators on learning needed to achieve SDG 4 and set standards for good practices on learning assessments by bringing together technical experts from around the world. Counting more than 250 members representing a wide range of stakeholders from UN Member States, academia, international organizations, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector, GAML is developing the standards and methodologies needed to measure learning globally while helping countries to produce and use the information to achieve SDG 4.

During the meeting, about 20 countries provided their perspectives to inform decision-making across the learning and skills-related indicators. In addition, four countries—Cambodia, Chad, The Gambia, and Tanzania—explained the data they would likely draw on to inform these indicators, as well as the challenges and needs that confront them. Inclusion of a large country contingent and a new decision-making approach differentiated the fifth GAML meeting from previous ones.

Aligning national and international measures of proficiency in math and reading

Day one of the meeting focused on procedural papers that would enable countries to align their learning outcomes data against content in the reading and mathematics areas, and to establish procedures that would enable the verification of appropriate standards of data collection tools. Of interest was the proposal that both statistical and non-statistical methods be used in these processes.

This was a welcome approach for countries that do not engage in international or regional large-scale assessment programs (LSAs), or that use data from national assessments, citizen-led assessments, or early grade reading/mathematics assessments.

Questions raised by countries included how to manage differences in identification of grade versus years of schooling for reporting—for example on Indicator 4.1.1 for Grades 2/3, end of primary, and end of lower secondary, and whether the proposed frameworks for reading and mathematics would provide sufficient guidance to countries in their local comparisons with their national assessment data.

Working out the details of several learning indicators and respective roles in GAML

During the second day, the Task Force working on indicator 4.4 presented extensive research on how to approach digital literacy and ICT indicators, with a subsequent proposal for adoption of a Global Framework on Digital Literacy Skills. The definition proposed for discussion was: “The ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate, and create information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, information literacy, and media literacy.”

Target 4.6 calls on countries to ‟ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy” by 2030. Task Force 4.6 described its methodological work, and the potential identification of different minimum proficiency levels according to country economic levels. Member States did not view establishing different minimum proficiency levels positively, especially given that that many countries vary significantly in their adult literacy proficiencies. However, reporting more than one proficiency level appeared sound, which would enable countries to make visible progress over time in a manner that setting just one level might not.

Task Force 4.7 presented extensive research to inform the global frameworks of education for sustainability and global citizenship. Addressing Indicator 4.7.5 in particular which relates to the “percentage of 15-year-old students showing proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience,” the Task Force discussed a proposal for use of Trends in International Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) Grade 8 assessment of biology and earth science. TIMSS biology includes the topics of ecosystems and human health, while earth science includes the topics of earth’s resources, their use, and conservation.

Recognizing the role of UNICEF rather than UIS as the custodian agency for Indicator 4.2.1 (proportion of children under five years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning, and psychosocial well-being, by sex), it was proposed that Task Force 4.2 dissolve and transfer its materials and research to UNICEF as the latter finalizes reporting approaches and methods.

Similarly illustrating GAML’s dynamic and responsive nature, there was a proposal that the Assessment Implementation Task Force, a cross-cutting group, re-form as the Capacity Development Task Force to focus on implications of the decisions made by the Task Forces, on country implementation, and on the needs that such decisions will stimulate within countries. Brookings and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) proposed to jointly lead this new task force.

As Day 2 drew to a close, countries presented a microcosm of the concerns that had been raised throughout the two days and the challenges they faced. Their questions included:

• What are the continuing gaps in data collection and how might these be addressed?

• What are the issues related to consolidation of data sets across agencies and how to resolve them?

• How to develop simple monitoring tools that could be used at decentralized level to capture learning outcomes?

Remaining challenges in SDG 4 monitoring

Beyond these immediate concerns, reporting against the learning and skills-related indicators of the SDGs raised significant philosophical issues for countries. At the national level, some countries noted a move away from reporting the percentage of students reaching particular levels of proficiency, in favor of more meaningful reporting that indicates actual student proficiencies. Although the positive potential implications of SDG reporting can help countries prioritize education, the apparent inconsistency between global reporting needs and constructive use of assessment nationally may need to be reconciled.

Similarly, where national curricula are not well aligned with the curricula that may increasingly be implied by the frameworks for reporting against the SDGs, will national education systems shift their own learning goals accordingly? When this does not happen, how indicative will data cherry-picked from national resources be of real learning outcomes?

Beyond technical questions and capacity needs, participants raised concerns around identification of stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities within countries. This highlighted the need for coordination across agencies (e.g. assessment units/agencies, EMIS units, and national statistics offices), and clear communication about not only the indicators, but also what data collection tools and data would meet required levels of quality for global reporting standards.

What’s the verdict?

While it may have been daunting for country representatives who were new to this platform to constructively engage in discussion during the packed two-day agenda, it was a successful start thanks to the excellent leadership and coordination of UIS.

Now it’s time for diverse stakeholders within countries to have access to similar information, pull it apart, and consider the best options for their own countries to identify data resources and use their reporting as levers for change.","It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

More than 290 of the world’s leading packaging brands have committed to ensure that 100 percent of plastic packaging can be reused, recycled or composted by 2025.

The ‘New Plastics Economy Global Commitment’ focuses on three actions to achieve a circular economy for plastic in which it never becomes waste. First, the Commitment signatories will aim to eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models. Additional targets include to: innovate to ensure 100 percent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled or composed by 2025; and circulate the plastic produced by significantly increasing the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging or products. The targets will be reviewed every 18 months, with the goal of making them increasingly ambitious in future years.

Businesses, governments and others around the world unite behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic.

Signatories to the Global Commitment represent 20 percent of all plastic packaging produced globally. Danone, H&M Group, L’Oreal, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Mars, Incorporated are among the consumer businesses that have made commitments alongside packing producers such as Amcor and plastics producers, including Novamont. Businesses that sign the commitment will publish annual data on their progress to ensure transparency and drive momentum.

Ellen MacArthur announced the initiative at the Our Ocean Conference, underscoring the importance of stopping plastic from entering the oceans. She said that the “New Plastics Economy Global Commitments draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic.” UNEP Executive Director, Erik Solheim, described the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment as the “most ambitious set of targets we have seen yet in the fight to beat plastics pollution.”

The Global Commitment is in line with SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) targets on sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (target 12.2) and reduction of waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (target 12.5). These actions also contribute to SDG 14 (life below water), including target 14.1 on preventing and reducing marine pollution of all kinds.

The Our Ocean Conferences have resulted in over 1,200 concrete, measurable and tracked commitments in support of sustainable management of the world’s oceans. The 2018 Our Ocean Conference took place in Bali, Indonesia, from 29-30 October.

The compendium is a result of a UNGA high-level meeting on financing the SDGs, organized by then-President Miroslav Lajcak in June 2018.



The event titled, ‘Financing for SDGs – Breaking the Bottlenecks of Investment, from Policy to Impact,’ brought together representatives of UN Member States, the private sector, UN entities, and other international organizations to explore how the UN can better align itself with the world of international finance in support of the 2030 Agenda. Participants took stock of recommendations, initiatives, and best practices for investing in SDG sectors in developing countries. The information shared at the event was then collected in the toolbox, which includes both existing and future global public and private initiatives.

In his letter announcing the toolbox’s launch to UN Member States in September 2018, Lajcak notes that it addresses both increasing private investment in SDG-related sectors, as well as improving the sustainability and inclusivity of private investments. The toolbox identifies four keys to boost financing for the SDGs:

Provide leadership, by setting guiding principles, galvanizing action, and ensuring policy coherence; Mobilize investment, by raising finance and reorienting financial markets towards investment in SDG sectors; Channel investment, by promoting and facilitating investment into SDG sectors; and Maximize investment impact, by increasing the sustainable development benefits and minimizing the risks of investment in SDG sectors.

The toolbox’s website was launched during the World Investment Forum held from 22-26 October 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. It will be managed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and continuously updated. Other partners in the toolbox include Aviva, the World Economic Forum, the European Investment Bank, the UN Foundation, OECD, the European Commission, and the UN Global Compact.","26 October 2018: The president of the 72nd UN General Assembly (UNGA) launched a “tool box” of recommendations, best practices and initiatives for SDG financing.

The action plan is in line with IMO’s commitment to support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water).

The ‘IMO Action Plan to Address Marine Plastic Litter from Ships’ recognizes the wide range of land- and sea-based activities through which marine plastic litter enters the marine environment. The plan highlights the negative effects of large plastic items, small plastic particles and microplastics on biodiversity, marine life and human health. In addition, the plan states that marine plastic litter can negatively impact activities like fishing, shipping and tourism.

The plan recommends specific measures to: reduce marine plastic litter generated from, and retrieved by, fishing vessels; reduce shipping’s contribution to marine plastic litter; improve the effectiveness of port reception and facilities and treatment in reducing marine plastic litter; enhance public awareness, education and seafarer training; improve understanding of the contribution of ships to marine plastic litter; improve understanding of the regulatory framework associated with marine plastic litter from ships; strengthen international cooperation; and target technical cooperation and capacity building.

The action plan recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and UNEP.

The action plan identifies a number of specific measures to tackle marine litter and waste, such as promoting reporting the loss of fishing gear and facilitating the delivery of retrieved fishing gear to shore facilities. Other measures suggest: consideration of actions, such as making marking of fishing gear mandatory, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the establishment of a compulsory mechanism to declare loss of containers at sea and identify the number of losses; and reviewing provisions related to the training of fishing vessel personnel and seafarers to ensure awareness of the impact of marine litter.

In addition, the plan proposes: measures to increase awareness and understanding, including a proposed study on marine plastic litter from ships; looking into the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities; and enhancing public awareness on marine plastic litter. The action plan also recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), such as by making information available to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

The action plan will build on and complement existing mechanisms and legislation that address the discharge of waste and plastic in the sea. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) aims to prevent pollution from ships by prohibiting ships from discharging plastic into the sea and requiring governments to ensure adequate port reception facilities to receive ship waste. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention and Protocol) regulates what materials can be dumped at sea and what materials are not permitted. The Action Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The MEPC adopted the action plan at its 73rd session that convened in London, UK, from 22-26 October 2018.

The Declaration of Astana will feed into discussions at the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 2019 high-level meeting on universal health care.



The Global Conference on Primary Health Care took place from 25-26 October 2018, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Kazakhstan. A high-level session on the first day adopted the Declaration of Astana and discussed a whole-of-government approach to improving primary health care. Yelzhan Birtanov, Minister of Health, Kazakhstan, anticipated that the adoption of the Declaration of Astana will set “new directions” for developing primary health care as the basis of health care systems.

The Declaration commits to strengthening national health care systems and making health for all a reality, 40 years after the first commitment to primary health care was made in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. SDG target 3.8 calls for achieving UHC, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

UNICEF calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single-disease interventions.

UNICEF notes that progress since 1978 has been uneven, with at least half the world’s population lacking access to essential health services, and almost six million children dying from preventable causes before reaching the age of five. The agency calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single disease interventions.

The Declaration acknowledges that, despite “remarkable progress” over the past 40 years, many people around the world still have unmet health care needs. It calls for action to counter the growing costs of health care, medicines and vaccines, and avoid waste and inefficiency in health care spending, acknowledging the impact of disproportionate out-of-pocket spending by patients and their families in causing poverty.

Other issues highlighted in the Declaration include the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, the burden of lifestyle-related and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the impact of environmental factors, such as extreme climate events, that affect people’s health. The Declaration commits to applying both scientific and traditional knowledge in primary health care, providing decent work and appropriate compensation for health professionals, and investing in education and training of the primary health care workforce.

The report notes the importance of economic structural transformation for poverty eradication and long-term development in LDCs.

Titled ‘Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation: Beyond Business as Usual,’ the report defines structural transformation as the transfer of production factors, such as land, labor and capital, from activities and sectors with low productivity and value added to those with higher productivity and value added, which are different “in location and organization, as well as technologically.” The publication discusses: sustainable development, structural transformation and entrepreneurship; the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs; the local entrepreneurship dimension of global production systems; major constraints and current policy frameworks to entrepreneurship in LDCs; and policies for transformational entrepreneurship.

On the LDC entrepreneurial “landscape” the report finds, among other observations, that: self-employment in LDCs is at 70% of total employment compared with 50% across other developing countries, and is declining only slowly; innovation is limited, with an average of 15% of early entrepreneurs reporting the introduction of a new product or service, compared with 24% in other developing countries; and only 12% of early entrepreneurs have a post-secondary education compared with 36% in other developing countries, which shows a low level of educational attainment.

The report states that several structural features of LDC economies, including limited financial development, insufficient infrastructure, lack of institutional development, elevated risk levels and the disempowerment of women, tend to weaken entrepreneurship and enterprise development. It adds that limited urbanization and the disproportionate role of agriculture also have an impact on the nature of enterprises in LDCs.

In order to harness entrepreneurship for structural transformation, the report calls for: entrepreneurship policies to foster linkages between firms of different sizes, stages of maturity and sectors by means of business clusters, networking and alliances; introducing entrepreneurship education and skills development in both mainstream and specialized education programmes; and creating clusters of learning, innovation and creativity involving universities, schools, research, vocational institutes and experimental laboratories to “sustain a flow of new ideas” into firms throughout their life cycle.

LDCs are countries characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The LDC category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures were needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries.

The 47 current LDCs are Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia. Vanuatu and Angola are scheduled to graduate from the LDC category in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

From funding female entrepreneurs in Ethiopia to providing more than two million households in Bangladesh with rooftop solar, the IDA is at the coalface of sustainable development around the world.

But after decades of funding its development work solely through its donors, its 173 member countries, 2016 marked a turning point.

ADVERTISEMENT

Every three years member governments gather at IDA to agree the replenishment rates and consider the institution's priorities for the coming years. The first meeting of IDA18, held just a few months after the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed at the UN, and just weeks after the Paris Agreement on climate change was struck, presented IDA stakeholders with a ""paradigm shift"" in the role of international development. Suddenly climate risk, poverty reduction, and sustainable development were in the global spotlight like never before.

Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is expected to cost between $5tr and $7tr. But in 2016 total official development assistance peaked at just $142.6bn. Looking at the scale of the challenge ahead back in early 2016, IDA made a momentous decision: to seek extra cash from the capital markets for the first time. ""Recognising that more than public money can achieve needs to be done and financed in order to achieve the ambitious SDGs, there was a discussion around bringing in this additional group of stakeholders, the private investors, so that the IDA can do more,"" recalls Heike Reichelt, head of investor relations and new product development at the World Bank.

It was a bold step, but IDA was confident its offer would attract considerable interest, Reichelt tells BusinessGreen. ""One of the reasons why the SDGs have been so warmly embraced by pretty much everyone is because there is this realisation that it's not just governments, it's not just government agencies,"" she explains. ""The private sector has a huge role to play, and the private sector wants to play a role. So it was a very opportune time to look again at IDA's financing model and think about how it can tap private capital.""

Tackling SDG 1 in particular - the target for eradicating poverty - is a key focus for IDA and was a major motivator behind its decision to launch an issuance. ""The SDGs are great and I really like them… but no poverty is in all of them,"" points out Reichelt. ""No hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation - they all move towards no poverty."" She explains IDA's twin goals since its inception are to eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world: ""So if you look at SDG1 - no poverty - that's basically everything we do.""

So with the decision made to reach out to the capital markets to boost IDA's ability to help the world's poorest, Reichelt and her team set off on a 'roadshow' around the world's financial capitals to gauge market interest. The ground had already been prepared by the rise of green and climate bonds, with private investors becoming rapidly more comfortable with impact investing as a mainstream 'liquid' investment opportunity, the term for an investment that can be readily traded and converted into cash.

Reichelt explains: ""There are investors who are focused on impact, focused on the purpose of their investments, and until green bonds impact investing [the market] was all very small, not liquid, type projects. But through green bonds investors have realised that they can have impact by purchasing liquid products.""

This has attracted more risk-averse investors into the market, says Reichelt. ""If you think about impact investing, often times it was investors investing in a particular project in a particular country,"" she explains. ""So those investors are taking the risk that [one project] won't succeed and they won't get repaid... But in the case of bonds, you issue bonds in the capital markets and it's a liquid, tradeable product, a bit like stocks, you can buy and sell them.""

This fitted more neatly with the kind of investors the World Bank traditionally engages with, she says. ""It is investors that are looking for high quality, so in the Triple A rating [category], which is the best credit rating you can get,"" she explains. ""Those are investors that look for safety - so central banks, but also pension funds, asset managers and others.""

Meanwhile, interest in ESG investments is on the rise as the risks of inaction on issues like climate risk become ever starker, and governments around the world push green finance as a growth industry. Investors aren't immune to the reputational bump a well-timed investment in sustainable development can offer either.

So with more larger, cautious players entering the impact investing market, IDA was in a prime position to tout its role as a safe investment bet for doing good. Its 60-year history of loans helped it secure a Triple A rating from the ratings agencies, and its bumper $160bn capital reserve also helped to reassure investors the financials of the issuance were sound.

""[IDA] had a super strong credit, had a good financial product, and then its purpose, its mission, was good,"" recalls Reichelt. ""So it was a very compelling story when we went to see investors.""

""Compelling"" translates into an inaugural bond issue that raised $1.5bn for IDA's lending programme and was heavily over-subscribed. ""We had initially intended to only do $1bn but it was so hard to cut the allocations because it was 4.5 times oversubscribed,"" reveals Reichelt. ""So it was a really tough session, we were talking to investors and some of them really wanted the bonds, so we really had to either cut entirely or give a lot less in bonds to them than they expected.""

Unsuprisingly then, IDA is already planning another bond issuance before its financial year ends in June, eyeing a further capital raise of $1.5bn through a mix of benchmark bonds and private placements. From there Reichelt predicts it will grow steadily, to around $10bn within a decade.

The success of IDA's inaugural issuance represents not just a step change in its strategy, but speaks volumes about the latent demand from the private markets to invest in ways which promote sustainable development. The growing international pressure to eliminate poverty and build a greener, more prosperous society, together with the increasing acceptance of impact investment as a mainstream liquid investment opportunity, have cultivated fertile ground for ethical investments.

Delivering the SDGs will involve billions - perhaps trillions - of investment dollars. But when presented with the right opportunity, it seems private investors are ready and willing to help the world get there.","The International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, has almost 60 years of experience in providing finance to some of the world's poorest countries.

Do the Tinsels

Of Tinsel-town

Like Christmas Day?

From my lair

On Mount Critic …

It’s tricky to say.

They Tinsel up holiday movies each year

But I don’t see much joy or holiday cheer.

For years now, they’ve built up a gloomulous glut

Of glum Christmas flicks. They’ve been stuck in a rut —

From R-rated dregs to Tim Allen-ish dreck

And the Jim Carrey Grinch, which is awful as heck.

The Tinsels don’t Seuss well. Their efforts fall flat,

From the unspooky Lorax to Mike in the Hat.

Only Horton was done right, kind and angelic

And Blue Sky’s Who-ville was drolly Geisel-ic.

But Ron Howard’s Who-ville was ugly and vile:

A hell in the ’burbs in true Tinsel-town style.

Shallow, promiscuous, cruel through and through.

If I’d been born there, I would be a Grinch, too.

Now we’re back in Who-ville for the Grinch’s return

With the Lorax and Minions crew — cause for concern.

While they’ve mastered the “secrets” of box-office glory

Their “despicable” debut was their last decent story.

It’s easy to see how this thing could go wrong

With Lorax-ish satire that doesn’t belong

In this tale of kind Whos who welcome a crank,

Enlarging his heart and forgiving his prank.

So I’m happy to state, though my praise may be faint-ish,

My critical heart is more pleased than complaint-ish.

The Tinsels have managed to Seuss out this one

And it’s decent, good-hearted, forgettable fun.

It’s visually playful, with gadgetry Gru-vy

Repurposed in new ways both Grinchy and Who-vy.

Especially the heist — a logistical dream

As much as a mean anti-holiday scheme.

Replacing Karloff-ian malice and spite

Cumberbatch-ian grousing makes this one Grinch-lite.

It’s a kinder and gentler tale than we’ve seen —

Of course he’s not nice, but this Grinch is less mean.

(I knew that he wasn’t as mean as he said

When he caved to his pets and let them in his bed.

And one is a reindeer as big as a moose!

This pushover’s not the guy scripted by Seuss!)

But he does still hate Christmas! The whole thing is bosh!

Except … gingerbread might be worth a nosh

And scenes of togetherness of kith and kin…

He sneers, but it’s clear he’s conflicted within.

And, you know, I’m okay with this sour-sweet sinner:

Clinging to mean … tempted by Christmas dinner.

The Whos are quite decent, I’m happy to say,

In an innocent, cheerful, Ned Flanders-ish way.

They may go a bit far with the whole Christmas thing,

But they sing for-real carols about Christ the King.

Then there’s Cindy-Lou Who, bouncy and sprightly —

A bit like young Ellie from Up, very slightly —

Determined to make contact with Santa Claus,

But her mother’s well-being is her only cause.

(Mom is single, a nurse, and works hard to get by.

It’s the third Dad-less Seuss film with no reason why.)

There are bits that don’t work, to tell you the truth,

Like glimpses of Grinchy’s unfortunate youth.

There’s hit-and-miss slapstick, and weak gags are made,

And added narration doesn’t quite make the grade.

(Pharrell Williams’ delivery falls a bit short;

Anapestic tetrameter isn’t his forte.)

But the group-hug finale sells it with feeling,

And Who-ville, though silly, is warmly appealing.

All are accepted, whatever the hue,

Or the shade, or the size, or the shape of the Who.

Even nasty outsiders, green-furred and alone

Find kindness and mercy to such as them shown.

The classic tale takes this too much as a given.

Seuss’ Grinch is converted — but is he forgiven?

When he brings the Whos’ things back down from Mount Crumpit,

Announcing himself with a literal trumpet,

Does he apologize — repent in the least?

Or merely presume of his place at the feast?

Grace is a gift, not a matter of course.

And that’s one way this movie improves on its source.

263,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/11/05/despite-growth-phl-not-seen-to-hit-sdg-goal-of-zero-hunger/,"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Business Mirror,"Despite growth, PHL not seen to hit SDG goal of zero hunger","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

266,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-indicator-group-sets-methodologies-for-all-but-44-indicators/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,SDG Indicator Group Sets Methodologies for All but 44 Indicators,"27 November 2018: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) reached agreement on measurement methodologies on several indicators. This agreement will allow for fuller measurement of several aspects of SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), as well as targets on sustainable food production, food waste, access to medicine, free primary and secondary education, market regulation, migration, sustainable urbanization, marine acidity, and organized crime, among others.

IAEG-SDGs 8 convened from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden, with one of the four days held in a closed format for IAEG members, and the other three days open to observers.

The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The framework was agreed on by the UN Statistical Commission and adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2017. The framework contains 232 indicators for measuring the 169 SDG targets.

Many of the indicators are still under development, and they are classified into three “tiers” to show their status: Tier I denotes that an indicator is both conceptually clear and available data exists for its measurement. A Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. If an indicator is classified as Tier III, it requires methodological development. Tier III indicators are not reflected in the annual SDG reports presented to the HLPF.

By the end of November 2018, following the meeting in Stockholm and subsequent discussions, the Group had agreed to reclassify the following indicators from Tier III to Tier II, reflecting agreement on the methodology for their measurement:

SDG 2 (zero hunger): Indicator 2.4.1 – Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (for Target 2.4 – Sustainable Food Production and Resilient Agricultural Practices) (target abbreviations per the Global Goals project);

SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing): Indicator 3.b.3 – Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (for Target 3.b – Support Research, Development and Universal Access to Affordable Vaccines and Medicines);

SDG 4 (quality education): Indicator 4.1.1 (a) – Proportion of children and young people in grades 2/3 (for Target 4.1 – Free Primary and Secondary Education);

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): Indicator 10.2.1 – Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 10.2 -Promote Universal Social, Economic and Political Inclusion); Indicator 10.5.1 – Financial Soundness Indicators (for Target 10.5 – Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions); Indicator 10.7.1 – Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination (for Target 10.7 – Responsible and Well-Managed Migration Policies); and Indicator 10.7.2 – Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (also for Target 10.7)

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): Indicator 11.3.2 – Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically (for Target 11.3 – Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization); and Indicator 11.7.1 – Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 11.7 – Provide Access to Safe and Inclusive Green and Public Spaces)

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): Indicator 12.3.1 (a) – Food loss index (for Target 12.3 – Halve Global Per Capita Food Waste)

SDG 14 (life below water): Indicator 14.3.1 – Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling station (for Target 14.3 – Reduce Ocean Acidification) (see SDG Knowledge Hub story on this indicator reclassification);

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): Indicator 16.4.2 – Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments (for Target 16.4 – Combat Organized Crime and Illicit Financial and Arms Flows); and Indicator 16.7.1 (a) Proportions of positions in national and local public institutions, including the legislature (for Target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making)



In addition, the Group reclassified six indicators from Tier II to Tier I, due to regular data production for these indicators. They correspond to SDG targets 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases); 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage) (2 indicators); 3.b (Support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines); 6.5 (Implement integrated water resources management) and 6.6 (Protect and restore water-related ecosystems).

For SDGs 12, 13 and 14, several indicators remain in Tier III. But for SDG 10, the reclassifications mean that only one indicator is Tier III.

As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:

Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);

Tier II: 82 indicators; and

Tier III: 44 indicators.

Six other indicators have components in different tiers.

Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III. Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;

SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; and

SDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III.

Among the remaining Tier III indicators, the following correspond to targets with a 2020 deadline:

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): Indicator 8.b.1 – Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy (for Target 8.b – By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization)

SDG 12: Indicator 12.2.1 – Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP (for Target 12.2 – By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources) Indicator 12.4.2 – Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment (for Target 12.4 – By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

SDG 13: Indicator 13.a.1 – Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment (for Target 13.a – Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible)

SDG 14: Indicator 14.2.1 – Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches (for Target 14.2 – By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans) Indicator 14.7.1 – Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries (for Target 14.7 – By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism)

SDG 15 (life on land): Indicator 15.9.1 – Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (for Target 15.9 – By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts)

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): Indicator 17.18.1 – Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (for Target 17.18 – By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts)



The Group plans to continue to reclassify indicators as requirements are met, considering them during semi-annual in-person meetings and bi-monthly teleconference meetings in between. The next tier reclassification web meetings will take place on 17 January and in early February 2019.

The next in-person IAEG meeting (March or April 2019) is expected to include the final progress review of Tier III indicators to determine whether any should be deleted. These will be included in a “preliminary list of possible deletions, replacements, adjustments and additions” for open consultation between May and July 2019 as part of the first “comprehensive review” of the global indicator framework. A list of 37 indicators under consideration for addition has been prepared.

The consultation results will be reviewed by September 2019, and a final proposal will be prepared for consideration by the UN Statistical Commission at its 51st meeting in March 2020. More details on the timeline of the comprehensive review are available here.

IAEG members stressed during the Stockholm meeting that the review should not lead to an additional burden on national statistical work, nor undermine the investments already made in national statistical systems.

The meeting also discussed: a minimum level of data disaggregation for each target and indicator; two proposed proxy indicators (for 11.a.1 and 12.b.1); and the draft guidelines on data flows and global data reporting.

Their call came on the 32nd anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Right to Development. The Special Rapporteurs note that the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at a time when the world is “wealthier but also more unequal than ever before.”

The Rapporteurs’ statement was released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In it, the Rapporteurs stress that inequality and discrimination threaten the right to development and are drivers for migration. The statement cites figures of 800 million people living in extreme poverty, while the richest 10% of the world’s population earn up to 40% of total global income and hold half of the world’s total wealth. The Special Rapporteurs urge all stakeholders to take the opportunity of the HLPF review of SDG 10 to bring about more equal societies.

Besides highlighting the dynamics of inequality among individuals and communities, the Special Rapporteurs observe that inequalities in the global governance system are hindering the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS) and countries affected by displaced people from realizing their right to development, while they are being disproportionately affected by climate change, natural hazards, environmental degradation and austerity policies. The statement recalls that the Declaration on the Right to Development enshrines equality of opportunity for everyone to be able to access education, health services, food and housing, and that tackling inequality and combating discrimination are legally binding obligations.

268,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

The Network will provide “effective, timely and coordinated system-wide” support to Member States, including by establishing the capacity-building mechanism called for in the Compact.



During the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which convened from 10-11 December 2018, in Marrakech, Morocco, 164 UN Member States adopted the Compact following an informal agreement reached in July 2018. In the Compact‘s section on implementation, governments establish a capacity-building mechanism allowing governments and companies to contribute technical, financial and human resources for implementation. In this regard, governments welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish a UN network on migration, which will aim to “ensure effective and coherent system-wide support for implementation, including the capacity-building mechanism, as well as follow-up and review of the Global Compact.”

Per the Network’s terms of reference, it will prioritize the rights and wellbeing of migrants and their communities of destination, origin, and transit. Its objectives include:

Supporting coherent action by the UN system at country, regional, and global levels in support of the Compact’s implementation;

Acting as a source of ideas, tools, reliable data and information, analysis, and policy guidance on migration issues, including through the capacity-building mechanism;

Ensuring close collaboration with other existing UN system coordination mechanisms that address migration-related issues;

Establishing and providing support to the capacity-building mechanism;

Engaging with external partners, including migrants, civil society, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith-based organizations, local authorities and communities, the private sector, employers’ and workers’ organizations, trade unions, etc.; and

Reporting to the UN Secretary-General on the Compact’s implementation.

The Network coordinator is the International Organization for Migration (IOM), through its Director General. The Network will consist of those members of the UN system who wish to be a part of it and for whom migration is of relevance to their mandates. Within that Network, an Executive Committee will be established, comprised of those entities with clear mandates, technical expertise and capacity in migration-related fields. The network will include Working Groups with IOM serving as their Secretariat. The Secretary-General will formally review the functional arrangements of the Network on a biennial basis, beginning in October 2020.

Speaking at the launch of the Network on 9 December, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “now we must breathe life into what we have agreed and demonstrate the Compact’s utility” to: governments as they establish and implement their own migration policies; communities of origin, transit and destination; and migrants themselves. To that end, he highlighted the Network as “a visible sign” of UN system’s commitment to the implementation of the “historic” compact.

Also on follow-up and review of the Compact, governments decide to rename the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development as the International Migration Review Forum. This Forum will serve as the main platform for discussing progress every four years, beginning in 2022.

The Marrakesh Conference took place in a two-day plenary debate and two dialogues, which focused on: ‘Promoting action on the commitments of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,’ and ‘Partnerships and innovative initiatives for the way forward.’ Speaking at the conference, Guterres explained that the Marrakech Compact rests on two ideas: that migration should be well managed and safe; and that national policies are far more likely to succeed if coupled with international cooperation. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), said the intergovernmental conference is a proof of the validity of multilateralism as the most effective tool to deal with one the world’s most pressing challenges.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, noted that her country will need more skilled labor from outside the EU, and has a vested interest in legal migration. She stressed that “the ‘go it alone’ approach will not solve the issue” and multilateralism is “the only way forward.” Pascal Teixeira, France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said his country is driven by the belief that “multilateralism is the only response to global challenges,” adding that human mobility will likely increase in the coming decades. “It is illusory to think we can build walls,” he highlighted, but still, “there is no absolute right to migration” and the global compact does not create one.

Erol Kiresepi, CEO of Santa Farma Pharmaceuticals, presented the International Organization of Employers’ Marrakech Declaration, outlining the immediate needs of companies, ways to partner with the private sector, and recommendations for Governments.

On the sidelines of the conference, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico presented a ‘Comprehensive Development Plan in the Framework of the Conference on the Global Compact for Migration,’ which is expected to “change the paradigm” of cooperation between Mexico andnorthern Central America, according to UN Economic and Social Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena. The Comprehensive Development Plan seeks to promote development and opportunities in the region, contributing to the prevention of the migratory phenomenon and attacking its structural causes.

270,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/indigenous-knowledge-and-epistemic-injustice-in-national-climate-planning/,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Indigenous Knowledge and Epistemic Injustice in National Climate Planning,"This week, global leaders assemble for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in the light of a groundbreaking report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this report titled, ‘Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C’ (SR15), the IPCC identifies several synergies between addressing global climate change and limiting global warming, on the one hand, and the realization of sustainable development in general and the SDGs in particular, on the other hand. By pursuing sustainable development it will be possible, in other words, to address global climate change, itself one of the SGDs (Goal 13).

Indigenous knowledge and indigenous peoples have been explicitly recognized as essential to achieving the SGDs. Indigenous communities often hold knowledge about the local socioeconomic circumstances and traditional adaptation practices that are essential for the successful adaptation to climate change. For example, while increased rainfall contributes to soil degradation by washing out essential minerals, indigenous Bolivian farmers, having faced this issue for generations, address it by planting their crops on raised farms, which protects them from seasonal flooding. Conversely, where indigenous knowledge has been disregarded, problems have commonly arisen. In the Andes, for example, the introduction of genetically modified potatoes threatens the diversity of crops that holds a significant cultural importance for the indigenous population.

Yet, as the influential ‘State of the World’s Indigenous Peoples’ report shows, while some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have made great strides to include indigenous peoples in national climate deliberations, indigenous communities have too often been excluded from or underrepresented within efforts to translate international climate policies at a national level in many other places where governments are less open to dissent from their populations.

We believe that this exclusion and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples from national climate strategy deliberations is epistemic injustice. Someone is subject to epistemic injustice when they are being unfairly excluded, silenced or not taken seriously within a decision-making process. Living in fragile areas that are likely to be impacted the most by climatic changes, such as mountain regions, rainforests, coastal regions, and small island developing States (SIDS), many indigenous communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change. Hence, they have a special interest in implementing sustainable and responsive climate strategies that take their knowledge and interests into account. Excluding or underrepresenting indigenous communities within national climate deliberation unfairly disadvantages them in that regard.

Labeling the exclusion, silencing, and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples in these climate strategy deliberations “epistemic injustice” indicates that one of the main challenges to achieving SDG 13 (climate action) in indigenous communities, in particular, is one of representation and inclusion. How can this challenge be overcome?

First of all, it is important to recognize that many indigenous communities suffer from additional social, economic, and democratic inequalities and injustices that negatively influence their epistemic power to influence the agenda on climate change and climate adaptation. Hence, one way to enable and empower indigenous communities to be part of national climate strategy negotiations is indirectly through addressing structural and socioeconomic inequalities (SDG 10). In this way, epistemic power and socioeconomic equality are mutually reinforcing.

Second, it is important for indigenous peoples to organize in order to increase their voice. At the international level, this has been achieved through the establishment of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), which aims “to enhance the engagement of local communities and indigenous peoples in the UNFCCC process” through the exchange of knowledge and best practices on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Indigenous communities could use this example to create similar platforms and partnerships at the national and regional levels, which, in turn, could contribute to the achievement of SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

However, many governments actively seek to suppress indigenous peoples from protesting national policies that run counter to sustainable climate action. Consider, for example, the legal actions taken against the Ardoch Alonquin First Nation of Canada protesting against uranium mining on their lands or, more recently, the arrests of Native American and Native Canadian protesters of the Keystone XL oil pipeline that will run through indigenous lands and threaten contamination of essential and culturally important sources of water, putting the health of indigenous communities at risk. The third recommendation is therefore for the international community to put pressure on governments and businesses to end exploitation and oppression of indigenous communities through the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies through the strengthening of a rule of law (SDG 16).

Most fundamentally, fourth, it is necessary to recognize the equal rights and voices of indigenous peoples as equal stakeholders in addressing climate change and to resist stereotypes of indigenous peoples and their knowledge as “primitive.” One of the greatest challenges to harness indigenous knowledge for climate action is still the perception that indigenous peoples are less knowledgeable than, say, scientific experts. More effort through the means identified above must be put into breaking this misconception to show that indigenous peoples, while some of the most vulnerable to climate change, possess valuable knowledge about sustainable and responsive climate strategies, which can and should be utilized in the development of national climate adaptation strategies.

271,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

Noting that there are more than 250 million migrants around the world, UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés stressed the need to take action, and clarified that the Compact does not affect the sovereignty of any State but, on the contrary, reinforces it since no State, “no matter how powerful,” can solve by its own means the challenges of international migration.

The Marrakech Compact on Migration was adopted during the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration that took place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 10-11 December 2018. The adoption of the Compact followed intergovernmental consultations led by the delegations of Mexico and Switzerland, which culminated in informal agreement on the text among Member States in July 2018. At the Marrakech conference, 164 UN Member States joined the Compact’s adoption.

After this adoption, the Compact was submitted for UNGA endorsement through draft resolution A/73/L.66 titled ‘Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.’ In the draft resolution, the UNGA: recalls resolution A/71/1 of 19 September 2016 in which it decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact as well as other related resolutions; expresses its gratitude to Morocco for hosting the Marrakech conference; and endorses the Global Compact on Migration adopted by the intergovernmental conference.

The endorsement of the Compact took place during a plenary meeting of the UNGA on 19 December 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Voting in favor of the resolution were 152 Member States, while five voted against it (Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Poland and US) and 12 abstained (Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Romania, Singapore and Switzerland). In addition, 24 Member States were not present to take part in the vote.

Addressing the UNGA before Member States took action, Espinosa remarked that the content of the Compact is the result of a broad and intense process of intergovernmental negotiations, and reflects the will of States to address, in a joint manner and with a balanced and integral vision, a complex challenge which is both cross-border and global. She also said the UNGA’s endorsement will allow to: reduce vulnerabilities in migration; address the needs of the communities of origin, transit and destination; fight discrimination and the negative rhetoric against migrants; foster the empowerment of migrants and the communities that take them in; facilitate migrants’ access to decent labor; and contribute to a safe and dignified return and readmission. During the plenary meeting, 43 countries took the floor during the plenary meeting to make statements on their respective votes.

In a statement issued on the day of the endorsement, the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, noted the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. He said the agreement: calls for greater solidarity with migrants in situations of “appalling vulnerability and abuse;” underscores the need to anticipate future trends, from labour markets to the impacts of climate change; and highlights the imperative of devising more legal pathways for migration, which would also help to crack down on trafficking and exploitation.

The UN Network on Migration also issued a statement to welcome the formal endorsement of the Compact. The statement notes that the UN system is committed to support the implementation of the Global Compact, and, through the Network, will help strengthen the benefits of migration and address its “many challenges.” The UN Network on Migration was established at the request of the UN Secretary-General, and currently comprises 38 entities from the UN system. The Network is coordinated by the Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with strategic oversight provided by an Executive Committee composed of eight UN entities.

In addition to the endorsement of the Marrakech Compact on Migration, the UNGA adopted, on 17 December, the Global Compact on Refugees. Both Compacts were called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants adopted by the UNGA in 2016.

By aligning short- and medium-term needs for adaptation and mitigation measures with resources and support from 18 NDC Partnership members through existing and planned projects, the plan seeks to fast track climate action.

The Partnership Plan addresses short-term priority needs set by the government for implementation of its long-term 2020-2025 NDC Roadmap, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring framework on low-carbon and resilient development that details sector-specific priorities that was developed through local and national level consultations. The Plan covers agriculture, civil aviation, energy, early warning systems, forestry, health, transport, urban mobility, waste and water.

The Partnership Plan focuses on:

development of pipelines of bankable climate change-related projects;

resource mobilization and project financing;

strengthening institutional coordination;

strengthening regulatory and institutional environments;

capacity enhancement for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors;

monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems and data management;

budget coding and tracking systems; and

private sector engagement.

Mozambique based its current NDC on its National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy 2013-2030, which seeks to increase community and economic resilience, and promote low-carbon development through integrating adaptation and mitigation into sectoral and local planning. The government has committed to reduce about 76.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 eq) from 2020 to 2030, conditional on the provision of support from the international community.

The Plan was developed in consultation with 21 government ministries and institutions and 18 NDC Partnership members, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Governments of Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the US, the European Commission (EC), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI), among others.

They include over-fishing, fisheries by-catch, illegal trade, habitat destruction, depletion of prey, pollution, boat strikes and climate change – according to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). These obstacles – formidable on their own – are compounded by the pelagic nature of many sharks. They range beyond any one country’s borders or jurisdiction.

In this context and amid declining populations, almost a decade ago, countries came together to do something about it. A big step was taken on 1 March 2010, in Manila, the Philippines – when range States signed into effect the CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. This was the first dedicated global instrument focused on safeguarding pelagic sharks. Its establishment set in motion a series of important policy steps that would raise awareness and the stakes for sharks conservation well into the future.

The first event was a meeting of the MoU signatories in 2012. With funding provided under the European Union Thematic Programme for Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy (ENRTP), the First Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 1) to the MoU convened in 2012. Its major outcome was the adoption of a Global Conservation Plan for the seven sharks species listed (at that time) under the MOU. The Plan aimed to catalyze global and regional initiatives to reduce threats to migratory sharks and to maintain their favorable conservation status based on the best available scientific information.

The Plan was based on five objectives: improving the understanding of migratory shark populations through research, monitoring and information exchange; ensuring that directed and non-directed fisheries for sharks were sustainable; ensuring, to the extent practicable, the protection of critical habitats and migratory corridors and critical life stages of sharks; increased public awareness of threats to sharks and their habitats, and enhanced public participation in conservation activities; and enhanced national, regional and international cooperation.

2014 shaped up to be an important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU.

Two years later, 2014 would shape up to be an incredibly important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU and Conservation Plan.

First, progress was made, also with ENTRP support, towards the implementation of the Plan, particularly to prevent wildlife trafficking in sharks in the Middle East and North Africa Region. Three workshops were organized to inform fisheries officers, custom officers and coast guards about legal requirements and guidelines regarding the conservation of sharks under various Conventions and relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). These meetings were held in Yemen, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and they exemplified the kind of outreach needed for the MoU to gain traction. Through these meetings, Arab countries came together to combat illegal international trade and looked for ways to collaborate under the framework of MoU. By the time these meetings concluded in 2014, the MoU’s membership had grown by 33%, with nine Arab countries joining.

Second, recognition of the MoU went beyond range State countries all the way to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). In a 2014 resolution, the UNGA welcomed a FAO review of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and affirmed the importance of the Sharks MoU (See A/RES/67/79).

Finally and also in 2014, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CMS (COP 11) convened in November. Of the thirty-one approved proposals to add species to the Convention’s two appendices, a record 21 shark, ray and sawfish species were added, as proposed by Kenya, Egypt, the European Union, Fiji, Costa Rica and Ecuador and leading the Conference to be nicknamed the “Sharks COP.” These listings were made as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group (SSG) released the results of the first-ever global analysis showing that a quarter of the world’s sharks and rays were threatened with extinction.

The work of the MoU was timely and gaining momentum. By 2016, as the Second Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 2) convened, MoU membership had grown to 40 countries. At this meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 15-19 February 2016, these Signatory States added 22 additional shark and ray species to Annex I of the MoU. They also created a Conservation Working Group.

Signatory States have now gathered for their third meeting, which is taking place from 10-14 December 2018, in Monaco. With 29 species now listed under the MoU, well beyond the seven species when it originally commenced, these States will discuss progress on the Action Plan and the agreement. It will also be an opportunity to harness momentum for the MoU, which has enabled collaboration on the conservation of sharks at a time when challenges to the ocean and all its inhabitants are growing.

Leaders focused on the future of work, infrastructure for development, a sustainable food future and a gender mainstreaming strategy across the G20 agenda, among other topics.

In the Declaration, G20 leaders reaffirm their commitment to leading the transformation towards sustainable development and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as the framework to advance this goal and the G20 Action Plan.

On a sustainable food future, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to tackle food security and encourage the voluntary use and sharing of innovative and traditional agricultural practices and technologies. Leaders highlight the importance of collaboration among public and private stakeholders to facilitate adaptation, strengthen risk management, protect biodiversity and provide effective responses to reduce the impacts of extreme weather on agriculture. Leaders further commit to increase efforts to enhance efficiency, sustainability, productivity and value addition and encourage initiatives to reduce food loss and waste.

On education, G20 leaders recognize access to education as a human right and underline the importance of girls’ education. Leaders commit to promoting coordination between employment and equitable, quality education policies.

On gender, G20 leaders recognize gender equality is critical for economic growth and fair and sustainable development, and note progress in reducing the gender gap in labor force participation while affirming that more needs to be done. Leaders commit to continue to promote initiatives to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls and gender-based violence and to promote women’s economic empowerment and improve labor conditions for all, such as through access to quality and affordable care infrastructure and parental leave and reducing the gender pay gap. Leaders further commit to promote women’s access to leaders and decision making and increase their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and high-tech sectors.

A strong economy and healthy planet are mutually reinforcing.

On infrastructure for development, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to attract more private capital to infrastructure investment, and endorse the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class and the G20 Principles for the Infrastructure Project Preparation Phase. Leaders commit to action to address data gaps, improve risk mitigation instruments and achieve greater contractual standardization.

On climate change, G20 leaders recognize that a strong economy and healthy planet “are mutually reinforcing,” and note the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15). Leaders recognize the importance of comprehensive adaptation strategies, and support actions and cooperation in developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable, including small island developing States (SIDS). Having discussed low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission strategies, shared country experiences and considered the work programme on adaptation, leaders look forward to “successful outcomes” of the Katowice Climate Change Conference. Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirm commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The US reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, “utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment.”

Also on energy, G20 leaders encourage energy transitions that combine growth with decreasing GHG emissions, and recognize opportunities for innovation, growth and job creation through increased investment in cleaner and sustainable energy sources. Leaders further recognize the “role of all energy sources and technologies in the energy mix and different possible national paths to achieve cleaner energy systems under the term ‘transitions’.” Leaders further commit to promote universal energy access by eradicating energy poverty.

On the future of work, G20 leaders recognize the importance of policy responses and international cooperation to ensure that benefits from technological transformations are widely shared. They endorse the Menu of Policy Options for the Future of Work, and state their commitment to consider individual country circumstances to harness technology to strengthen growth and productivity, support people during transitions and address distributional challenges, secure sustainable tax systems and ensure evidence-based decision making. Leaders further express commitment to, inter alia: promoting decent work, vocational training and skills development; making social protection systems strong and portable, subject to national law and circumstances; increasing labor force participation of underrepresented and vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities; implementing policies to improve the employment situation of young people, consistent with the G20 Antalya Youth Goal; and taking actions to eradicate child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and modern slavery in the world of work, including through fostering sustainable supply chains.

In the declaration, leaders also address the importance of: mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion; enhancing early childhood development to break the cycle of intergenerational and structural poverty and reduce inequalities; implementing health-related aspects of the SDGs, including reducing the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR), moving towards universal health coverage (UHC) and ending HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; addressing the root causes of displacement and growing humanitarian needs; and preventing and fighting corruption and fostering transparency and integrity in the public and private sectors.

Estimates previously have suggested that achieving the 17 SDGs and their 169 sub-targets could open up $12 trillion of market opportunities in food, agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and wellbeing, leading to millions of new jobs while future proofing the economy against escalating social and environmental risks. And the evidence that commercial benefits flow from delivering on the SDGs is not limited to forward-looking estimates. Earlier this month, a study of 13 major corporates found their SDG-aligned strategies already generated $233 billion in revenues in 2017 alone.

The incentives for embedding sustainability more deeply into business practices, it would seem, scarcely could be greater. So what's holding companies back?

On a surface level, at least, companies appear to be aware of the business benefits of the SDGs and are keen to take them seriously. A survey of more than 700 businesses carried out by professional services giant PwC and published last week found that almost three quarters — 72 percent — now mention the SDGs in their annual corporate or sustainability reports, marking a 10 percentage point uptick on last year. Welcome news, certainly, given it is just three years since the SDGs were launched in 2015.

Yet the survey also identified a major gap between companies' expressed intentions and their ability to turn their SDG-aligned strategies into concrete actions. Less than a third of companies disclosed meaningful key performance indicators linked to the SDGs, or mentioned SDGs as part of their business strategy, suggesting deeper integration of sustainability goals within wider business operations remains elusive.

Less than a third of companies disclosed meaningful key performance indicators linked to the SDGs, or mentioned SDGs as part of their business strategy. Louise Scott, global SDG lead at PwC, said broad awareness of the goals was a positive step, but still only a small step in the path towards 2030. ""For every one of the 17 goals, there are pressing real-world issues that directly impact the world of business,"" she said. ""While there is a clear appetite for embracing the SDGs, many organizations still lack the strategy, tools and culture needed to transform those commitments into tangible business actions.""

Fortunately, however, support for companies keen to develop tangible SDG measures appears to be growing, with a new report released late last week joining the canon of work aimed at bridging that very gap between businesses SDG ambitions and actions. Published by global supply chain sustainability membership organization Sedex, the report is bolstered by numerous case studies and tools to help firms set measurable sustainability targets.

According to Elloise Neale, responsible sourcing product executive at Sedex and co-author of the report, the aim was to demystify the SDGs, which can at first appear overwhelmingly all-encompassing for many firms.

""In industry over the past year, everyone has been talking about the SDGs, but I think there has been a lack of breaking it down — setting out what the SDGs are and how to achieve them,"" she tells us. ""There's obviously a real interest in these goals. They're applicable to businesses, individuals and governments, so we thought: 'Why don't we create a case-study best practice report that makes it more applicable at business level?'""

The resulting report is 68 pages long and covers every one of the 17 SDGs, setting out possible next steps for each SDG, backed by case studies from Sedex members which already have set down measurable actions and targets. After Friday's inaugural report, Sedex's aim is to release updates and new case studies on a quarterly basis in order to track progress and build the evidence case and support for companies working towards the SDGs. Boasting 50,000 members of all sizes operating throughout global supply chains, Sedex is able to tap into a raft of knowledge and experience, explains Neale.

We wanted to really reach out to the smaller supplier countries or companies in other countries where maybe the SDGs aren't quite so well known. ""The big advantage for us is that we have so many supplier members, which tend to be a lot smaller than the bigger buyers, and we wanted to have something that wasn't just addressing those massive companies that have a lot of resources solely dedicated to responsible sourcing,"" she says. ""We wanted to really reach out to the smaller supplier countries or companies in other countries where maybe the SDGs aren't quite so well known.""

The report shows how companies can link progress made towards the SDGs with audit reports and actions, as well as highlighting the context and challenges of each goal. So, for SDG 13 on Climate Action, the report first sets out clearly the dangers faced by the global economy from inaction, such as the estimated reduction in grain yields of about 5 percent for every degree of temperature rise. Then, it lists the potential actions Sedex members should consider taking, ranging from reducing water, waste, and emissions from internal operations, to continuously assessing climate risks and maximizing use of renewable energy.

Yet perhaps most valuable to report readers are the variety of best practice examples offered. For SDG 13, these include how Tesco went about setting set science-based targets to cut its 2015 emissions 35 percent by 2020, 60 percent by 2025 and 100 percent by 2050. And a page is also given over to explaining HSBC's efforts to support the growing green bonds market as part of its commitment to provide $100 billion of sustainable finance and investment by 2025. In both cases, the report links Tesco's and HSBC's efforts back to the SDGs, and how they are benefitting both their own business but also wider society.

Neale believes it is becoming more commonplace for companies to collaborate on sustainability issues rather than see each other as competitors alone, and that sharing best practice is the best way for companies to learn — and ultimately for the world as a whole to achieve the SDGs.

""Every business will have its own challenges and also goals they see as being more reachable, and I think being able to reach out to other businesses that are perhaps stronger in some areas is important,"" she says. ""Increasingly, members are really happy to discuss, share and collaborate with each other in order to achieve the best possible outcome for everyone, which is really great to see.""

Just as important as encouraging companies to develop new sustainability measures and targets is enabling them to link, measure and report on existing work that they are already doing. Yet just as important as encouraging companies to develop new sustainability measures and targets is enabling them to link, measure and report on existing work that they are already doing, but which may not immediately realize is helping drive forward the SDGs. Although initially aimed at company sustainability, procurement and ethical trade teams, the ultimate aim of the report for Neale is to normalize sustainability thinking right across businesses and supply chains in order to drive continuous improvement.

""It can make businesses look inwards to what they are already doing, but that doesn't then mean your work has to stop — it's something you can build on,"" says Neale. ""It enables a business to see where they already are in the process and then look inwards and take ownership of developing actions towards the SDGs. Ultimately, everything a business is doing can help work towards the goals, but at Sedex it is really about continuous improvement. You can always be doing something more.""

Nevertheless, no matter the size of the company or supply chain, measuring a business strategy against all 17 SDGs is a challenging task. Alex Sykes, responsible sourcing innovation executive at Sedex and the other co-author of the report, suggests that while companies should have a ""base level of work"" across all of the SDGs, different industries and firms also can focus on one or two priority goals for action. But, he says, companies shouldn't feel daunted by the prospect.

""There's 17 SDGs, and businesses may not know where to start,"" he tells us. ""We've tried to take these quite high level government targets and explain that they are not only very achievable, but that companies are probably already achieving them in their business strategies. For example, for Health and Wellbeing [SDG 3], just by supporting pregnant women and providing maternity leave, that's a way in which you're going about achieving that goal. So it's about us trying to take what is seen as quite complicated, especially for those which may not have heard about the SDGs or are quite small suppliers around the world, and being able to really simplify it. That's not something which has been done much before.""

Whether the world eventually can achieve all of the SDGs by their fast-approaching 2030 deadline remains to be seen, but as the evidence of their business benefits continues to mount and more businesses share their best practice advice, Sedex's new quarterly report quickly could become an invaluable guide for sustainability executives around the world.","Building businesses around the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pays off — not just for the planet and society, but for the bottom line.

As a contribution to correcting this shortcoming, this issue of SDG Knowledge Weekly focuses on the newsworthy, Africa-related events that took place and knowledge products that were released around the COP.

The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) previewed findings from a joint assessment of Africa’s “Green Growth Readiness” at a COP 24 side event on 10 December 2018. Through case studies from Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia, the assessment covers: the current state of green growth in Africa; readiness to promote green growth in the context of SDG implementation; and roles of development partners (including AfDB and GGGI) in promoting green growth in the context of implementing the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. An IPS News article reports that the study found urgent needs around finance, as well as the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth.

Also on green growth, the Government of Rwanda hosted the inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum, which took place in Kigali, from 26-30 November 2018, under the theme: ‘For a green and climate resilient Africa.’ The agenda highlights the timing of the Forum just prior to COP 24, noting that the discussions will serve as an input to the discussions in Poland. Among the many speeches and presentations available, Anthony Nyong, AfDB, highlights investing in green growth in Africa. Among other topics, he describes AfDB tools and investment opportunities in the agriculture and energy sectors, barriers to adoption of green growth technologies, and lessons learned at country level.

A regional NDC hub for African countries was launched “to engage national, sub-national, non-state actors and private sector representatives on appropriate policies, strategies and actions tailored to suit individual needs of African countries to enable them deliver their climate change commitments.” The Hub, which AfDB established in November 2017, focuses on three main areas: long-term climate action; mobilizing means of implementation; and coordination, advocacy and partnerships.

An AfDB brochure summarizes the Hub’s purposes, goals and intended outcomes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities, barriers to success and financial needs for fully realizing countries’ NDC targets, laying out a roadmap for achievement. In support of these objectives, AfDB and partners held discussions at COP 24 on encouraging cooperation across regional NDC hubs and operationalizing NDCs in Africa. A compilation of AfDB publications released prior to and in the margins of COP 24 is available here.

Many African countries “already live the future” of a two degrees warmer planet.

Despite progress on NDC implementation, a second article by Isaiah Esipisu on IPS News notes that many African countries “already live the future” of a scenario where the planet has warmed by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Responding to questions by Esipisu, Gernot Laganda, World Food Programme (WFP), stresses that climate change is already affecting food security, noting that the number of hungry people is increasing and extreme weather events continually drag people back into poverty. Agriculture-based economies, such as those in Africa, feel the effects of climate change most acutely, he explains, adding that one consequence of climate change is migration, which “is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism.”

Echoing Laganda’s point on migration, Gilbert Houngbo, President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasizes the need to “invest in Africa’s youth before migration to Europe doubles,” as reported by Hannah Summers in The Guardian. Houngbo flags the importance of investment in sustainable farming on the continent, but acknowledges that more is needed: “priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare.” He also describes access to modern technology as being essential for young people and outlines the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment in rural areas. All are key to ensuring food security and profitability of smallholder farms, which can stem migration flows.

The key, as highlighted by Houngbo above, is investment. The Brookings Institution’s Landry Signé and Witney Schneidman reflect on the inaugural Africa Investment Forum, held from 7-9 November 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Forum, they note, was convened with the aim of “unlocking Africa’s investment potential by facilitating onsite transactions.” While the Forum previewed over 230 projects across 15 sectors and announced investment interest in 49 projects worth US$38.7 billion, Signé and Schneidman note that lower business costs through better business regulations and special economic zones are needed, lest the deals face challenges to implementation and long-term sustainability.

The African Economic Conference was held from 3-5 December 2018, in Kigali, Rwanda. Convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the conference took place on the theme ‘regional and continental integration for Africa’s development,’ building on the March 2018 commitment of 44 African countries to a common market for Africa, known as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the earlier launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016. Supporting papers cover information and communications technology (ICT), economic integration’s impacts on the environment, regional integration versus bilateral diplomacy, food security, gender equality and energy, among other topics. Numerous UNECA press releases on these subjects are also available.

During the conference, UNECA launched the 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report, which tracks the continent’s progress towards both the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063. The report aligns with the theme of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)— “transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies”—focusing on the five SDGs reviewed: 6 (clean water and sanitation); 7 (affordable and clean energy); 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 15 (life on land). A detailed write-up on the report’s findings against each Goal is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Finally, the Intra-African Trade Fair 2018 was held 11-17 December 2018, in Cairo, Egypt. Hosted by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the Fair aimed to bring African businesses together to share information and explore opportunities on the continent. The Afreximbank convened the Fair in part due to low rates of trade within Africa, attributed in part to lack of access to trade and market information.

278,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

The brief recommends that States with high levels of internal displacement address the needs of IDPs in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that countries include information on IDPs in their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

Authored by Alice Debarre, Archibald Henry and Masooma Rahmaty, IPI, the brief explores links between internal displacement and the SDGs, highlights ongoing efforts to address the longer-term needs of IDPs, looks at the specific cases of Nigeria and Iraq, and provides recommendations for ways forward. The brief titled, ‘Reaching Internally Displaced Persons to Achieve the 2030 Agenda,’ notes the need to understand international displacement as a long-term challenge that requires coordinated and complementary approaches by humanitarian and development actors.

The authors define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence… and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border,” in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 1998 by the UN Special Representative on IDPs and represent an international framework that “authoritatively restates the rights” of IDPs, as enshrined in international human rights and humanitarian law. The 30 principles cover IDPs’ needs during displacement, return, resettlement and reintegration, and have gained broad international acceptance and authority, although they were never officially adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The brief recalls that the 2030 Agenda pledges to “leave no one behind” and highlights IDPs as a vulnerable group that must be empowered through efforts to implement the SDGs. While there are no SDG targets or indicators specifically related to internal displacement, the brief notes, the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity to build on existing efforts and ensure that the plight of IDPs is addressed in both the short and long terms. It states that many of the SDGs are directly related to IDPs, and including IDPs in policies to implement the SDGs could help reduce the occurrence and impact of displacement and ensure that IDPs contribute to local economies and economic growth. In this regard, the authors report that Nigeria has included IDPs in its VNR, and linked the issue particularly with SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

The authors also remark that neither the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration nor the Global Compact for Refugees address the issue of internal displacement. They explain that some States perceive international attention to IDP issues as an infringement on their sovereignty and have therefore been reluctant to address it in multilateral fora.

The brief reports that, as of May 2018, there are over 40 million IDPs due to conflict and violence in the world, which is nearly twice the number of refugees worldwide. Also, since they are displaced within national borders, IDPs do not benefit from the legal status of refugees and its associated protections, and fall outside of the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Among other challenges to addressing IDPs’ needs, the authors note that the different funding streams of humanitarian and development actors and the existing field architecture for UN agencies inhibit efforts to operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus, while being not conducive to joint action or collective outcomes. The authors also cite inadequate collection, processing, and sharing of data on IDPs, and the fact that supporting IDPs is not traditionally perceived as a development issue and is insufficiently included in development strategy and planning.

On initiatives that have been taken at the international level regarding IDPs, the authors outline: the April 2018 launch of the multistakeholder ‘GP20 Plan of Action for Advancing Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People 2018– 2020;’ the development, by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), of a framework for addressing internal displacement; and the establishment, in 2018, of a UN Joint Steering Committee in charge of advancing humanitarian and development collaboration and assessing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, following the UN Secretary-General’s proposal to reform the UN development system.

The brief also notes that 37 States sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General in July 2018 asking him to appoint a high-level panel on IDPs in order to bring attention to existing efforts and galvanize continuing action.

The charter recognizes the fashion industry’s role as both a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and as a sector with opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while contributing to sustainable development.

Forty-three fashion leaders representing fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, a major shipping company and others committed to addressing climate change through the ‘Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,’ which complements and supports other fashion industry initiatives aimed at increasing climate action. The Charter aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and presents a vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition, the Charter sets an initial target for the industry to reduce their aggregate GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, including through phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their companies and direct suppliers beginning in 2025.

In the Charter, CEOs and presidents of fashion organizations commit to support the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and increase their collaboration within and beyond the fashion sectors towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The Charter commits signatories to analyze and set a decarbonization pathway for the fashion industry, building on methodologies from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and by developing a work programme and tools necessary to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets. Signatories further commit to, inter alia: quantify, track and publicly report on GHG emissions; prioritize materials with low-climate impact without negatively affecting other sustainability aspects; and pursue energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in fashion value chains. Signatories also commit to: support a global transition to low-carbon transport by giving preference to low-carbon logistics; support the movement towards circular business models; and establish a closer dialogue with consumers to increase awareness about the GHG emissions caused in use and end-of-life phases of products, to build towards changed consumer behaviors that reduce environmental impacts and extend the useful life of products.

The Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work.

The Charter developed out of efforts by fashion leaders to shape a climate movement, which was chaired by PUMA SE and H&M Group. PUMA CEO Bjørn Gulden said shared supply chains generate over 90 percent of PUMA’s carbon footprint. He stressed that if PUMA wants to reduce carbon emissions in its supply chain, the company must “work together with our industry peers.” He welcomed the Charter’s collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, and called on other industry peers to join the initiative. H&M Group CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said the Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work, emphasizing that “only together” can the industry “create the change that is urgently needed.” He said H&M supports the Charter as part of the Group’s “ambition to become climate positive in our value chain.”

UNFCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa observed that the fashion industry “is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture” and is now also “leading the way in terms of climate action.” She welcomed the Charter, expressing hope that it will set an example for others to follow.

To ensure concrete progress on the Charter’s commitments, the Charter establishes seven working groups in which signatories will work to define next steps for implementation. The working groups are: decarbonization pathway and GHG emission reductions; raw material; manufacturing/energy; logistics; policy engagement; leveraging existing tools and initiatives; and promoting broader climate action. The UNFCCC is expected to convene the working groups in early 2019, and will play a role in tracking industry progress towards the Charter. The Charter is open for other companies and organizations to join.

The policy brief is based on findings from the NDC-SDG Connections Tool, developed by the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and SEI, which analyzes connections between climate change and the SDGs by identifying synergies. The tool derives activities from countries’ NDCs into categories of climate action, and links these with SDG targets.

The complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes.

The authors identify SDG themes with the strongest climate synergies such as energy, agriculture, water, resilience, resource efficiency, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and infrastructure. The document notes that different ministerial departments are responsible for implementing the NDCs and SDGs, and highlights that “too often they work in silos, and the complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes of decision-making.”

The authors note that new approaches at the global, national and sub-national levels that integrate horizontal and vertical decision making and increase policy coherence are essential to avoid implementation inefficiencies and to assist in achieving desired outcomes.

The brief highlights trade-offs and gaps between climate action and sustainable development arising from implementation, which include trade-offs in the global stocktake (GST) process under the Paris Agreement on climate change and financing processes. To minimize trade-offs, the authors recommend that countries that have not yet embarked on implementing the SDGs design their future national sustainable development strategies in a way that takes account of and complements their existing NDCs by focusing on issues that have not been addressed in them. They also recommend that countries take into account existing national sustainable development strategies and their synergistic potential in their future NDCs.

ICEL also published a Note explaining how and why the forthcoming consultations on the global pact could reach consensus on the codification and progressive development of core principles of international environmental law.

ICEL is an expert international organization established in 1969. ICEL prepared the chart series with the Vance Center for International Justice and White & Case, an international law firm.

The charts were created to serve as a public resource for the UN Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group that will negotiate on the global pact in 2019. The Group was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to discuss options to address possible gaps in international environmental law and environment-related instruments, and make recommendations.

The charts show the linkages between the proposed global pact and the SDGs, general principles of international soft law, multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), and various regional environmental agreements.

The Note that is available alongside the charts was produced by ICEL with the International Group of Expert for the Pact (IGEP) and the World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

In an advance copy of a report on the global pact for the environment, released on 30 November, the UN Secretary-General notes that international environmental law and its effective implementation could be strengthened through a comprehensive and unifying international instrument that gathers all principles of environmental law. The report responds to UNGA resolution 72/277, adopted in May 2018, through which UN Member States requested the UN Secretary-General to submit “a technical and evidence-based” report that identifies and assesses possible gaps in international environmental law and environment-related instruments, with a view to strengthening their implementation.

The Working Group’s first substantive session on the global pact will be held from 14-18 January 2019, at the UN Environment Programme’s headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. By the UNGA resolution, the Working Group’s recommendations “may include the convening of an intergovernmental conference to adopt an international instrument.” [IUCN Press Release] [Pace Law School Library webpage for Global Pact]","ICEL also published a Note explaining how and why the forthcoming consultations on the global pact could reach consensus on the codification and progressive development of core principles of international environmental law.

The analysis ranks 91 areas of disclosure in terms of their materiality to companies in 40 sectors, then links those areas to the 169 SDG targets to determine which areas and targets are the most important within each sector.

The publication titled, ‘Sector Study on Sustainability Materiality of the SDG Targets and GRI Indicators,’ aims to provide a starting point for discussion and planning around analyzing and determining the sector-specific materiality of the SDG targets and GRI indicators / disclosure topics. “Materiality” refers to the importance of an issue to a company or industry. As a legal concept, it is a measure or threshold above which missing or incorrect information, particularly in financial statements, is considered to have an impact on decision making.

An all-sector overview report outlines the study’s methodology, various uses, and potential for further company- and sector-specific analysis. The authors review the 1,387 reports published between March 2016 and March 2017 in accordance with GRI’s G4 guidelines. GRI has since adopted a common set of standards, to which the report maps and translates the previous G4 areas of disclosure.

The study is divided into sector-specific publications, such as: aerospace and defense; mining; pharmaceuticals; and travel & leisure. Each sector report lists the companies whose reports were analyzed, then ranks the most important SDG targets and GRI indicators using a standardized scoring system. Each rank notes the corresponding SDG, target, overarching business theme, relevant GRI G4 indicator, and linked GRI Standard Disclosure, and provides a description of the GRI indicator.

The reports also provide color-coded heatmaps to identify the most important areas.

The brief underscores the potential contributions of UN-REDD Programme projects on planning for REDD+ to the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The brief aims to help countries engaged in REDD+ planning to consider additional environmental and social benefits, including biodiversity conservation, provision of food, fuel and fiber, support to local livelihoods and soil erosion control, using an integrated land-use planning approach. The brief further seeks to build capacity on the use of spatial analyses to help identify areas where REDD+ could deliver non-carbon benefits.

On the SDGs, the brief describes REDD+ contributions to SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). For SDG 13, the brief highlights contributions to climate change mitigation through supporting countries in the use of spatial analyses to plan for REDD+ actions that reduce emissions and deliver environmental and social benefits. The brief argues that these analyses help countries to: design interventions that strengthen adaptive capacity and resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters (contributing to SDG target 13.1); integrate climate measures into national planning, policies and strategies (contributing to SDG target 13.2); and improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation (in line with SDG target 13.3).

Consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen implementation of REDD+, the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

REDD+ actions contribute to several SDG 15 targets by focusing on the consideration of benefits beyond carbon in REDD+ and helping countries to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem values into national and local planning and poverty reduction strategies, in line with SDG target 15.9. Further, countries can design REDD+ actions to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services (SDG target 15.1) and mountain ecosystems (SDG target 15.4) as well as to promote the sustainable use of forests and halt deforestation (SDG target 15.2) and reduce habitat degradation and tackle biodiversity loss (SDG target 15.5).

On the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the brief highlights the contributions of REDD+ to Strategic Goals A, B, C and D. As an illustration, UN-REDD Programme projects help countries to identify overlap between areas of high risk of deforestation and areas that are home to endangered species, which helps countries to prioritize areas for REDD+ and sustainable forest management interventions (Aichi Targets 5 and 7) that can reduce pressures on biodiversity and forests while contributing to improvements in species conservation status (Aichi Target 12).

The brief highlights the results of the UN-REDD Programme, which supports 64 partner countries around the world. Twenty-two countries have published a National REDD+ Strategy or Action Plan, all of which include achieving non-carbon benefits among their strategies, goals or objectives. The brief underscores how the consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen REDD+ implementation and simultaneously help countries to achieve the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

He described UNDP’s work with the UN Secretary-General’s transition team to ensure that the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019.



Among Steiner’s updates was the announcement that the transition of the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) was completed on 1 November 2018, and DOCO is now part of the Secretariat, with funding from UNDP and its current configuration until June 2019 in order to ensure a smooth transition.

Steiner said the system went through an exercise to determine how many of the current 129 Resident Coordinators (RC) want to remain RCs, and how many want to return to UNDP or their originating agencies. The exercise was completed at the end of September 2018, with 117 of them choosing to remain RCs. Thus the “lift and shift” operation will consist of moving 90% of the current RCs from UNDP to the Secretariat. He said this implies developing a service level agreement that will cover a second request by the Secretary-General, comprised of: putting in place an infrastructure to allow the RCs to operate on 1 January 2019; helping staff their offices in 129 countries; and setting the payroll for the 129 RCs and 1,200 RC offices and DOCO staff that form the new RC system.

Steiner reported that this operation will cost UNDP US$2.6 million, and emphasized the need to ensure sufficient funding for the Secretariat to support the new structure moving forward. He said the cost of the contribution to the RC system by UNDP will be US$10.3 million.

“Everything is happening as we speak,” Steiner noted, with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) currently developing new job descriptions for the RCs, as well as the mutual accountability framework between RCs and the UN country teams. This exercise is being conducted as a collaboration between UNDP, the UN Secretariat, and the transition team, Steiner said. He added that interim protocols and internal control frameworks are also needed for the process to delink the RCs from UNDP.

Steiner also flagged the required “unprecedented exercise” of replacing the 117 UNDP country resident representatives, since the current RCs have been playing that role. He said that UNDP has had four months to identify and appoint the new resident representatives by the end of 2018. He reported that in one month of advertising the openings, UNDP received 3,500 applications, and 195 candidates are currently shortlisted. He saluted the fact that 22% of the candidates are from Africa.

Steiner noted that UNDP is coming from “an extremely contractive period,” in which it was in deficit while Member States’ contributions were at a historical low, and hundreds of posts were frozen or eliminated; the total staff decreased by 1,000 of its total of 8,000 between 2012 and 2017. Currently, UNDP is increasing at a rate of 6-9% per annum, and replacing its pyramidal structure with a “21st century” global policy expertise network, which will be rolled out starting 1 January 2019. Steiner said more resources are going to Africa and the Arab states in conflict, UNDP is reducing operational costs while delivering more, and it is “delivering on the promises for the UN development system reform.”

Steiner added that UNDP is exceeding delivery on all its six of its “signature solutions” in 2018, and anticipated having one of the highest rates of delivery in the history of the UN.

In the ensuing discussion, Member States asked whether UNDP or the RC will play the integrative role for the UN presence in countries (Albania), inquired about the timeline for new appointments to be discussed with host governments (El Salvador), asked about an internal communication strategy for UNDP’s new relationship with other UN agencies on the ground (Switzerland), asked what the impact will be on multi-country offices (Antigua and Barbuda), and requested information on plans for private sector partnerships (Netherlands, Sweden and US).

Steiner said UNDP will move away from coordinating UN agencies’ activity on the ground. He emphasized that the role of the RC is not to implement the SDGs, but to coordinate SDG implementation on the ground, and UNDP will support the RCs when requested. He explained that UNDP’s integrative platform is an offer, with the agencies on the ground and the RCs to decide if or when to use it. He clarified that UNDP’s principal role is not to serve as the integrative platform for the UN system but provide the development support.

The UNDP Administrator said the appointment letters for the RCs were to be sent to countries in November 2018. He also added that no major changes will be made to the current composition of the UNDP country teams.

The “new vision for the Resident Coordinator” is outlined on the UN’s reform website, which also provides other information on the repositioning of the UN development system, overall. An update on the status of the reforms can be found in this policy brief from September 2018, and a summary of the Secretary-General’s September briefing on RC system reform is available here.

The guidelines highlight the potential contribution of improved housing to achieving SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).



WHO developed the guidelines based on reviews of the scientific literature and specially commissioned studies. The guidelines are intended for policy makers who set housing-related policies and regulations, and for industry professionals such as urban planners, architects and housing developers. The guidelines affirm the need to address the social determinants of health and tackle social and health inequalities. WHO emphasized that, besides health considerations, better housing conditions can also increase quality of life and help mitigate climate change, as well-insulated housing decreases heating and cooling costs, reducing energy consumption and contributing to achievement of SDG 13 (climate action).

The guide draws on experiences and knowledge from around the world on matters such as privacy, safety and facilities for managing menstrual hygiene and baby care, also providing information on meeting the needs of older adults and persons with disabilities.

The agencies note that women and girls suffer disproportionately from inadequate sanitation, as their specific needs are often overlooked by planners. They further note that public or community toilets may be the only sanitation option for people living in informal settlements. The 54-page guide, made up of three main sections, explains: why public and community toilets are needed and why they must be female-friendly; what are the essential and desirable features of female-friendly toilets; and how to build gender sensitivity into a city-wide needs assessment with regard to toilets.

The agencies emphasize that the UN has recognized the rights to water and sanitation as human rights since 2010, and that governments have a responsibility to provide universal access to sanitation. They state that toilets should be “sufficient in number” as well as physically accessible, safe, affordable, and designed for everyone to use. SDG target 6.2 commits to achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

Leading up to the release of the guide, on 30 October the agencies convened a virtual conference on Menstrual Hygiene Management in schools. [Publication: Female-friendly Public and Community Toilets: a Guide for Planners and Decision Makers] [UN-Water News Release]","20 December 2018: The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WaterAid, and Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) have jointly published a guide to help local authorities and other service providers plan and build toilets that meet the needs of women and girls.
The agencies note that women and girls suffer disproportionately from inadequate sanitation, as their specific needs are often overlooked by planners.
They further note that public or community toilets may be the only sanitation option for people living in informal settlements.
The 54-page guide, made up of three main sections, explains: why public and community toilets are needed and why they must be female-friendly; what are the essential and desirable features of female-friendly toilets; and how to build gender sensitivity into a city-wide needs assessment with regard to toilets.

The species that will now receive this protection include: the dusky shark; the common guitarfish; the bottlenose wedgefish/whitespotted wedgefish together with two lookalike species, the smoothnose wedgefish and whitespotted wedgefish/giant guitarfish; the oceanic whitetip shark; the angelshark; and the smooth hammerhead shark.

Additional decisions taken during the meeting include: a provision regarding lookalike species; a procedure for modifying Annex 1 of the MoU, addressing the listing criteria; terms of reference for the intersessional working group on conservation measures; the guidance for MoU Signatories and the Secretariat in their engagement with regional fisheries management organizations; a communication and awareness-raising strategy; a capacity-building programme; a budget increase of 10.4% for the upcoming triennium; and the programme of work 2019-2021.

The MoU is moving more strongly into implementation of conservation actions.

MOS3 convened from 10-14 December 2018 in the Principality of Monaco. Organized by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), whose Secretariat is provided by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), this was the third MOS since the Sharks MoU came into effect in 2011.

CMS was designed as a framework through which Parties may conserve migratory species and their habitats by: adopting strict protection measures for migratory species characterized as endangered throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges (species listed in Appendix I of the Convention); concluding agreements for the conservation and management of migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit from international cooperation (species listed in Appendix II); and joint research and monitoring activities.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of MOS3 highlights that key accomplishments in addition to adding eight species to Annex 1 included the “creation of three intersessional working groups (IWGs), and a sense that the MoU is moving more strongly into implementation of conservation actions.” In her closing remarks on behalf of CMS Executive Secretary Bradnee Chambers, Melanie Virtue, CMS Secretariat, also highlighted the discussion on species listings and the nature of the listings, guidance on habitat conservation, and the capacity-building programme as MOS3 accomplishments.

290,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/africa-report-finds-slow-progress-on-clean-water-energy-urbanization/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Africa Report Finds Slow Progress on Clean Water, Energy, Urbanization","4 December 2018: The 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report highlights the region’s progress on the SDGs and shares lessons learned in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africa’s Agenda 2063. The 2018 report focuses on five Goals, aligned with the focus of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); and SDG 15 (life on land).

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa jointly prepared the annual report. They launched the report at the 12th session of the Committee of Director-Generals of the National Statistics Office, which took place in Khartoum, Sudan.

On SDG 6, the report finds that access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation has improved in Africa but remains very low by global standards, despite the fact that Africa, excluding North Africa, receives the largest amount of official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. In addition, there are wide disparities between and within countries, with higher access in North Africa compared to the rest of the continent. The proportion of people with safely managed sources of drinking water varies from 100% in Mauritius to 19% in Eritrea. Further, 43% of Africa’s rural population has access to basic drinking water services compared to 82% of the urban population. The report identifies several emerging challenges that threaten progress on SDG 6, including climate change, droughts, floods and water management.

On SDG 7, the report finds access to electricity has increased from 39.7% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2014 in Africa. Despite this progress, access to electricity is “much lower than the global average” and rural-urban disparities are “particularly stark,” with an average electrification rate of 70% among the urban population compared to 17% in rural areas. Hydropower generation accounts for slightly over 60% of Africa’s electricity supply but other renewable energy sources, particularly solar, remain “largely untapped.” Africa’s efficiency in energy use has improved but biomass reliance remains a challenge, with approximately 780 million people cooking with solid biomass.

On SDG 11, the report states that Africa is the fastest urbanizing region in the world, with the urban population predicted to increase from 40% today to 51.5% by 2040. The report reflects that much of the continent’s urbanization is “unplanned…and poorly managed,” and is characterized by severe service and infrastructure deficits and social and spatial segregation as well as the world’s highest proportion of slum dwellers. In addition, the report finds that Africa’s cities have made limited progress on air pollution and solid waste collection, loss and damage from disasters, access to public transport and urban sprawl, constraining the region’s efforts to achieve inclusive growth.

On SDG 12, the report finds that Africa, excluding North Africa, wastes more than 30% of its annual food production as a result of poor post-harvest handling, with most losses occurring at the level of production. Africa’s domestic material consumption remains low.

On SDG 15, Africa’s rate of forest cover loss is “much higher” than the global average. In contrast to this regional trend, Ghana and the Gambia have increased their forest cover as a percentage of their land area. Like other regions of the world, the report observes Africa faces the risk of extinction of major animal species. On a positive note, Africa outperforms most world regions in the conservation and sustainable use of its mountain resources.

The report also reflects on SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), emphasizing that the development of science, technology and innovation (STI) are key for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The report finds that Africa’s STI infrastructure, as measured by internet access and access to electricity, “is improving but relatively weak” and characterized by low investments in research and development and fragmented innovation systems. The report recognizes the investments made by Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia on research and development and strategies to strengthen their innovation systems. The report also underscores the need for strengthening inter-sectoral planning and collaboration to ensure coherent, effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

The report recommends that policymakers, inter alia: prioritize investments in water and sanitation to improve access, enhance health outcomes and leverage populations’ productive capacities; improve rural access to energy to address rural-urban disparities; improve access to energy-efficient cooking stoves to enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution and improve health outcomes; and provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The report also calls for strengthening capacities for urban planning and management to drive inclusive and sustainable economic prosperity and integrating urbanization in national development planning.

Participants discussed the report’s findings at the 13th African Economic Conference (AEC), hosted by the UNECA, AfDB and UNDP in Kigali, Rwanda, from 3-5 December 2018. Adam Elhiraika, UNECA, called for investing in data and analysis on urban trends and impacts of environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, among other recommendations. Chidozie Emenuga, AfDB, said the potential of Africa’s rapidly growing cities and urban settlements “has not been fully tapped.” He urged providing incentives to investments in sanitation, renewable energy and access to electricity.

The partnership, which was made in the spirit of SDG-17, is between leading Canadian-based global travel risk management and travel insurance provider Ingle International Inc., and SUNx (Strong Universal Network), which focusses on Climate Friendly Travel. The partnership is founded on a shared commitment to develop the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program, with Ingle International as its first global sponsor.

Speaking from COP 24 – the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Professor Geoffrey Lipman, Co-founder of SUNx, said:

""We are honoured to announce our partnership with Ingle International to launch the global rollout of the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program. This will create 100,000 ""Strong Climate Champions"" by 2030, in every UN State, to help to drive the behavioural change and influence the fundamental government and industry actions needed to tackle Climate Change.

We need to realize the exposure to our children and grandchildren. We need to stop talking amongst ourselves, and engage directly with future generations. SUNx – a legacy initiative for Maurice Strong, the father of global Sustainable Development Action – will spearhead a movement for 100,000 climate activists by 2030, responding creatively to the Paris Accords and SDG-13.

By the simple act of a Scholarship Plan for graduates committed to help society take action towards more stable temperature levels, we can empower the next generation, who are the ones that will have to really deal with the transformation to the New Climate Economy.""

Robin Ingle, CEO of Ingle International said:

""As a global travel risk management and insurance provider, we specialize in assessing risk, and there is no greater risk to our civilisation than Climate Change, as Sir David Attenborough pointed out at the start of the COP 24 meeting. At the same time, we identify ways to mitigate and respond to these risks positively, and we see no better means in doing this than to empower the next generation with the knowledge base that they will need to take action. Also, as a Canadian, I recognise the immense contribution that Maurice Strong made for half a century to help put in place the actions we are taking today. These are some of the reasons why Ingle International is proud to be the first global sponsor of this important program.""

GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has expressed dissatisfaction over the state’s ranking at the fourth spot in the SDG ( Sustainable Development Goals ) Index by the Niti Ayog in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday and instructed secretaries to take the SDG index ranks of Gujarat seriously — especially the poor rank on social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health etc.

The officials also claim that the state could have performed better if the state schemes and other indicators had been included in the overall ranking. Chief secretary J N Singh also reportedly directed secretaries for regular monitoring of the goals and preparation of the district-wise goals to improve Gujarat’s SDG ranking next year.

Niti Aayog classified the states on four grades namely Achiever (100 score-1st grade), front runner(65-99 score-2nd grade), Performer (50-64 score 3rd grade) and Aspirant (0-49 score-4th grade). Though Gujarat managed to achieve 4th rank (along with other five states) in overall score due to its performance in industry, sanitation, urban management etc., its performance on the key social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health, gender ratio balancing have shown the state in very poor light as the state is clubbed with low-ranking states.

A senior officer close to the development said, “To improve the state’s ranking in the SDG index the strategy have been made to aligning/mapping of 388 state indicators identified by the State with 306 National Indicators Framework (NIF) through consultations with the line departments. Preparation of indicator-wise meta data by the state SDG cell and other agencies have been initiated. For a day-to-day monitoring, development of the state SDG dashboard will be started shortly.”

“The government has also decided to constitute district level SDG implementation committees,’’ said the official.

Thing is, they added so much flow to a ride that the piss-poor dependability was sorta accepted back then. Riders would fix or replace them, but who went back to a tall posting? No one, I'd guess. These days, a dropper has to not just go up and down, but also do it for a long time without needing any attention.



SDG's new Tellis post needs to do exactly that in order to be considered a contender, which is exactly why I've had the $269.99 USD dropper on a high-mileage bike for the last six months. The cable-actuated, hydraulically-controlled Tellis can be had with 125mm or 150mm of drop, and there will also be a 170mm version available early in 2019.

Can a dropper post be reasonably priced and still be reliable? SDG's Tellis is exactly that.

Inside the Tellis





It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that,

Alignment is done via a key-way system, and the actuator at the bottom of the post, along with the remote itself, is designed to deliver a very light feel at the rider's thumb. Up top, a 3D forged head is home to a twin, opposing bolt system to clamp the seat rails, which is much more reliable than a single bolt running from left to right that'll eventually let the seat rotate backward.It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that, SDG has created a bunch of how-to videos that cover everything from a basic installation to a 400-hour service or a full cartridge replacement. That's how it should be done. SDG says that they wanted a dropper that's both reliable and simple to work on. The replacement cartridge goes for $44.99 USD.

The Tellis' lever can mount in just a single orientation: On the left and under the 'bar like a remote should be mounted.

With flawless reliability, simple construction, and a remote that requires next to no thumb pressure, the Tellis is a worthy dropper to consider.

Performance

Pinkbike's Take:

If the Tellis had been released four or five years ago, it would have been one of the only reliable options on the market and probably one of the least expensive. Things have moved on, however, and there are a handful of decent options to choose from these days, including SDG's now proven performer. The Tellis is relatively affordable compared to many other dropper posts, it's easy to install and, most importantly for many of us, it's demonstrated perfect reliability. — Mike Levy

There are loads of different dropper posts to pick from these days, but what isn't widely known is that many of them use the same, or at least very similar, hydraulic cartridge from Wintek to control their stroke. The cartridges are relatively inexpensive - SDG asks $44.99 USD for a new one - but they've also proven themselves to be pretty damn reliable. Sure, they're not serviceable for the most part, but is that a bad thing when they seem to run smoothly for ages? I don't think so, and the rest of the post is easy to service when the time comes.The Tellis' remote isn't one of those that can be mounted every which way to the point of it working on your drop bar-equipped recumbent. Instead, it's a simple thumb paddle that's designed to sit where your front shifter used to be back when dropping your seat meant getting off the bike. The clamp is split, of course, and the paddle sports a braille-like textured section for added traction.The cable is clamped at the lever (the head slots into the actuator at the bottom of the post) via a rather small set screw, and while it isn't the most elegant way to get the job done, it works.Besides slipping the cable's head into the actuator, then pulling it taut and clamping it, there isn't much to do. That first install took fifteen minutes, at most, and the tension hasn't needed any tinkering since.There was essentially no side-to-side play at the post's head when it was first put on the bike, and there still isn't any six months down the road. That bodes well for long-term performance, as does the smooth action and no hiccups at any point in the stroke. SDG says that the Tellis works well in temps as low as -20c, and while it never got that nippy, it does seem to be indifferent to what the weather is up to. The touch of top-out at the top of the stroke is nice, too, as it lets you know that it's back up to full mast.SDG touts a very light feel at the lever and they're not lying - the thumb paddle might depress if you blew on it. The shape of the cam is key here, and it'll be boon on any bike that has terrible cable routing that adds friction into the system from the bends being too tight. It should also help keep the lever moving decently when contamination has gotten into the line, although the real solution there is to do some maintenance.","It wasn't that long ago that you could count on your dropper post to stop going up and down sometime between when it was brand new and an hour into your first lap on it.

THE KIT

Since day one, we have been at the forefront of the MTB saddle game, supporting riders for over 20 years. While many are still onboard and riding today, they are having children of their own, which has shown us the need for quality youth components that were truly designed to fit smaller bodies. The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.

Srinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

According to SDG India Index Baseline Report-2018 released by the NITI Aayog on Thursday, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have been ranked on top 3 positions and are on track to achieve the UN SDG.

J&K’s overall SDG index score is 53 and has been ranked 20 performing states and 27th among states as well as union territories in the country.

As per SDG report, the states with cent percent score are enumerated as achievers, states with a score between 65 to 99 are front runners, states with a score ranging between 50 to 64 are performers and states with a score from 0 to 49 are listed as aspirants.

The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 goals with 169 targets by the United Nations. These goals were adopted by India in 2015 and are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all citizens.

The SDG index aims to promote healthy competition among states by evaluating their progress in social, economic and environmental terms that will help India in achieving the UN SDG by 2030.

These goals are aimed to end poverty in all its forms, end hunger, ensure good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth.

NITI Aayog, CEO, Amitabh Kant, said SDG index has been prepared to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its states and UTs.

The report has been jointly prepared by the State Governments, Central Ministries, United Nations in India and NITI Aayog knowledge partners.

The performance of the states and union territories on indicators for SDG is based on percentage of the population living below national poverty line, households with any usual member covered by any health insurance scheme, persons provided employment under MGNREGA, percentage of population receiving social protection under maternity benefit and homeless households.

The agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), were adopted by 193 countries at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. The SDGs, which came into effect from 1 January 2016, have 2030 as their deadline for achieving the targets. SDGs are aimed at addressing key aspects of universal well-being across different socio-economic, cultural, geographical divisions as also the interconnectedness among these social multiple dimensions of improving human welfare.

According to NITI Aayog, State Governments have been taking leading role through Panchayati Raj Institutions, urban local bodies and civil society organizations to take the SDGs forward and to ensure that the most marginalized persons are reached first.

“SDGs can only be met through visionary long-term strategic planning and cooperative federalism, where governments at both the Centre and States work together to bring about transformation. States play a huge role in the implementation of government programmers and in influencing all social and economic parameters necessary to achieve SDGs,” said Amitabh Kant.","Adil AhmadSrinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

“It started out when he was really tiny,” said St. Denis. “He loved to feed the animals. What we do at home is we have a fake tree that we put on the porch and we put carrots and everything on it and he gets to feed the animals.”

St. Denis said they then started to talk about the animals that didn’t have homes and she asked Richer if he wanted to do something for them.

“I explained it to him and he said, ‘oh yea,’” she said.

One of the things Richer loves about donating to the animal shelter is he also gets to go and check out the animals that are still there. All decked out in elf ears and Christmas themed clothes, the family and friends dropped off bags and bags of treats, food and toys for the animals.","Article contentIt all started with a little boy’s love for animals.

These two new ambulances, and every ambulance to be purchased going forward will have a new Stryker Power-Load System and new blue emergency lighting systems on the front and back.

The new power lift system lifts the ambulance stretcher and the patient into the ambulance and locks it in place without effort from the paramedics.

“This is a new safety system for paramedics and patients,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall and SDG Paramedics. “Until now, the paramedics had to lift all of the weight.”

Lister explained that the stretcher weighs 100 pounds, and that their average patient weighs 190 pounds, but that the new power-load system can lift up to 700 pounds.

The new power-load system will reduce the annual lifting load of paramedics by over 10 million pounds a year.

The new lighting system on the ambulances replaces the traditional red-white emergency lights on the front and back of the vehicle with a red-blue combo.

“Many studies have shown that the blue lights are more noticeable and effective in difficult weather situations like fog, rain and snow,” said Lister.

The Stryker Power-Load System costs $27,000 each and the new emergency lighting system will cost $600 each. Right now, only the two newest ambulances are equipped with these systems. Cornwall and SDG Paramedics replace an ambulance every 54 months and their goal is to have their entire fleet of 14 ambulances equipped with these systems within four years.","CORNWALL, Ontario – The Cornwall and SDG Paramedics Service unveiled two new ambulances on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018 that come with two new features that promise to increase the safety of paramedics and patients.

299,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-mary-poppins-returns,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Mary Poppins Returns’,"Like Christopher Robin, Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, and Steven Spielberg’s Hook, Mary Poppins Returns is yet another revisionist sequel about childhood whimsy lost and regained.

In the last 10 minutes or so of Mary Poppins Returns, something truly magical happens.

First, Dick Van Dyke shows up, virtually reprising his brief secondary role from Mary Poppins as the ancient bank president, except that, at 91 (at the time of the shoot; he’s now 93), he has now aged into the role — even if he’s still spryer than the doddering geezer he played in 1964. (That character died laughing in the original, so Van Dyke is playing his son here.)

Then, in the finale at the park, Angela Lansbury (also now 93) shows up to sing a song. It hardly matters that Lansbury has no prior connection to Mary Poppins. She’s an icon of the same milieu, having played a magical caretaker of children in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, another live-action/animation hybrid musical from exactly the same creative team. (Lansbury’s chief source of Disney cred comes, of course, from playing Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast.)

Van Dyke dances and Lansbury sings — and somehow they’re just exactly the same, in a way that Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill weren’t and couldn’t be in the new Star Wars films.

They rise above all possible objections and criticism, and, for those brief minutes, Mary Poppins Returns feels genuinely of a piece with the original and its world. Not weak homage, like Fantasia 2000; not a pale retread, like the nouveau Beauty and the Beast; not a subversion, like Maleficent; but the Real Thing, like the underappreciated 2011 Winnie the Pooh.

So. About the two hours before that.

Here is where I must confess that, for all my affection for Van Dyke — and, of course, the legendary Julie Andrews — I have no great affection for Walt Disney’s beloved take on P.L. Travers’ magical nanny. I’m fully aware that for many readers this discredits entirely whatever thoughts I may have about Mary Poppins Returns, if not movies in general. I understand completely. Said readers are more than welcome to stop reading here and turn to some less contrarian critic.

I do recognize the tremendous talent that went into Mary Poppins. The Sherman brothers’ songs alone, arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, almost earn the film’s classic status. And I can’t complain too much about the sketchy plot and who-cares resolution, since clearly it’s beside the point.

One thing that does bug me are vestiges of themes and ideas inherited from Travers’ books that make no sense in their sanitized, Disneyfied context. I hold no brief for or against Travers’ books, which I’ve never read, but she was a complicated and unconventional woman with strong ideas about politics and social order, feminism and patriarchy, class and economics. Whatever one thinks of Travers’ ideas or how her books express them, in the movie these themes float about with no real purpose or function.

In a way, my lack of enthusiasm for Mary Poppins works in the new film’s favor. If Mary Poppins Returns, co-written and directed by Rob Marshall (Into the Woods), has a rather slapdash plot, well, so did the original.

There’s more plot here than in the original, and more conflict, with an established crisis, a villain, a menacing animated chase sequence, and a climactic action-thriller finale. Perhaps this is a concession to the expectations of a generation of children raised on tougher fare.

Yet nostalgia for the innocent spirit of the original pervades Mary Poppins Returns. Indeed, nostalgia for the original pervades virtually every aspect of the new film, from the production design of Cherry Tree Lane, where Emily Blunt’s Mary Poppins arrives to look after the next generation of Banks children, to the beat-for-beat exactness with which the sequel follows the original. It’s a meticulous exercise in re-creation, as exact as possible in almost every respect.

Young Michael and Jane are now grown-up and played by Ben Wishaw and Emily Mortimer. Michael, a sensitive artist, is a young widower with three children of his own (Pixie Davies, Nathanael Saleh and Joel Dawson). He now works as a lowly teller at the bank where his father was a partner. Jane is single and takes after their suffragette mother’s social consciousness as a labor activist.

What about Blunt? For generations of fans, of course, Andrews is the quintessential and irreplaceable Mary Poppins — but the character has been interpreted in other ways, notably in the popular stage musical. (Travers, meanwhile, hated the movie, but that’s another topic.) I saw Laura Michelle Kelly play Mary Poppins on Broadway in 2011, and I liked her slightly ambiguous, capricious, mischievous take on the character.

Blunt is a chameleonic actress, and her Mary Poppins is in the spirit of Kelly’s, which might only be another way of saying that Andrews’ absolute beatific benevolence belongs to her alone. Mary Poppins is not necessarily Julie Andrews, but Andrews being Andrews makes Mary Poppins the movie that it is, and no one else could possibly have done it.

Like this year’s Christopher Robin, Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, and the granddaddy of them all, Steven Spielberg’s Hook, Mary Poppins Returns is yet another revisionist sequel about childhood whimsy lost and regained.

Robin Williams’ lawyer in Hook had forgotten all about being Peter Pan. Likewise, Alice and Christopher Robin came to suppose that Wonderland and the Hundred-Acre Wood were just childhood imagination. Now, Jane and Michael also believe that all their adventures with Mary Poppins were just pretend, too.

Hook has been interpreted as an expression of nostalgia for the childlike wonder of Spielberg’s early work and concern about losing touch with that. Could Disney’s repeated revisiting of the same trope suggest a similar anxiety on a corporate level?

For the most part, though, the better you know Mary Poppins, the more certain you will be about what will happen next in Mary Poppins Returns.

Here’s where Mary and the kids visited Uncle Albert, so now it’s time for a visit to another relative of Mary’s (Meryl Streep), and it turns out that this one also plays with gravity. Here’s where Mary brings the kids to the bank and allows them to get into a scrape that causes their father grief, though it will all work out in the end.

Here’s where Bert and the chimney sweeps did Step in Time, so now we’ll have another big choreographed dance number with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Jack and his fellow “leeries” or lamplighters. (As this sequence approached, I thought: The sweeps went up to the rooftops, and that wouldn’t make sense for the leeries, so the obvious thing would be to go down … and, sure enough, a lamppost becomes a firehouse pole going down into the sewers, though the scene doesn’t stay there.)

This holds true until it doesn’t, and the climax is a suspense set piece corresponding to nothing in the original. At least the resolution is given narrative weight, though if you think about it it may occur to you that a) Mary Poppins sabotaged the family in order to “save” them, and b) Michael Banks is utterly incompetent to run a household or to be responsible for children.

And, if you have any affection for the denouement of the original, you may or may not be exasperated (I was) to hear a famous line that is the very soul of whimsy and playfulness suddenly given urgent dramatic meaning. Just imagine if one of the characters were a diabetic who had taken too much insulin and someone had said very seriously, “Quick! A spoonful of sugar, and hurry!” As bad as that would be, this is worse.

And yet the more nostalgic you are for Mary Poppins, it may be that the more you will enjoy this meticulous cinematic cover. The songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray) are pretty forgettable, but there are a couple you might hum a bit before returning to A Spoonful of Sugar and Let’s Go Fly a Kite.

One of the more memorable songs, Where the Lost Things Go, offers a kind of sentimental elegy for whatever is lost, including Michael’s late wife and the mother of his children.

Mary Poppins was hardly a Christian film, but at least in Feed the Birds there were saints and apostles looking down and smiling on people who showed they cared. Painting a whimsical verbal picture about a lost dish or spoon playing hide-and-seek behind the moon is one thing. That’s not a place I’d care to put my dearly departed loved ones.

Professor Dr. Md. Muzammal Haque, Dean of the Faculty of Arts & Humanities, JU, Dr. Md Khalid Quddus, Chairman, Department of International Relations, JU and Mr. Azmal Mahmud Khan, Assistant Professor from the same department spoke at the inaugural session.

The workshop started with a key-note presentation by Professor Dr. Md. Amzad Hossain, Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, Australia and also SDGs coordinator Bangladesh Chapter. Professor Hossain specifically focused on the self-sustaining process of nature which is gradually getting disturbed by modernisation as well as industrialisation. In line with this, he shed light upon the concept of inter-generational equity, modest and simple way of living, sustainable consumption pattern, ethical and cultural behavior in order to achieve SDGs in Bangladesh.

Mohammad Golam Sarwar, Lecturer, Department of Law, University of Dhaka and the Facilitator of SDG Lab stressed on the nexus between international law and SDGs. He also gave an account of and explained the thin line of difference that exists between growth and development. He also touched upon some key challenges involved in the process of working for and achieving SDGs. Sekander Zulker Nayeen, Joint District Judge, Tangail and Director of SDG Lab highlighted the issues of Sustainable Development in the arena of International Investment Law, with focus on the importance of adding clauses of Sustainable Development and healthy environment while inviting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and concluding Bilateral Investment Treaty(ies) (BITs) and/or Treaties with Investment Provisions (TIPs).

Mahmudul Hoque Moni, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and the Facilitator of SDG Lab discussed about the delicate connection that sustainable development shares with global institutional partnerships.

302,https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-forex-us-dollar-passes-sdg-70-mark-on-khartoum-streets,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Radio Dabanga,Sudan forex: US Dollar passes SDG 70 mark on Khartoum streets,"December 11 - 2018 KHARTOUM

The Sudanese Pound (SDG) continues to fall against the US Dollar, as the greenback surpasses the SDG 70 threshold on the parallel market in Khartoum. This in spite of a crackdown against street forex traders by the security authorities this weekend.

Financial analyst, former banker and civil society activist Hafiz Ismail predicts “the depreciation of the Sudanese Pound and the deterioration of the standard of living will continue to an unusual extent, with no foreseeable end”.

His remarks came after the Dollar purchase price in the black market rose to between SDG 62 and SDG 63 for cash and for cheques at SDG 72.

The Market Makers Mechanism retains the Dollar purchase price of SDG 47.5 in commercial banks and ATMs, however, Ismail told Radio Dabanga that partial treatment as it is happening now is for no avail and stressed the need for radical treatment in the overall framework.

Balance of payments deficit

Ismail says: “The current government does not have the ability to find any radical solutions due to the weak infrastructure of the economy, the large balance of payments deficit, and the lack of sources of financing or external borrowing.”

He pointed out that “the government’s attempt to drain cash liquidity created another problem: It converted the same currency into a commodity so that the price of the cheque and the price of hard cash are different.” He added that “many people are trading in the Sudanese Pound.”

He attributed the problem to the lack of the overall view of the solution and the lack of means of reform in the hands of the current government.

68.93% inflation

The rate of inflation in Sudan rose to 68.93 per cent in November.

Ismail: “Prime Minister and Finance Minister Motaz Mousa did not imagine the severity of the crisis when he took office because the problem looked like an economic crisis. However, it is in essence a crisis of governance that needs radical reforms, a comprehensive review of the state apparatus, performance of government, and fighting corruption.”

Ismail said that “contrary to the belief of many, Sudan is not a free market because a few groups are monopolising goods and control their prices”.

He pointed out that the increase in commodity prices occurs much higher than the decrease of the value of Sudanese Pound because traders in this way want to maintain their capital despite the disastrous effects on the citizen.

He added that the lack of confidence in the government makes things worse because officials say contradictory things and make promises that do not keep or have the ability to do so, which accelerates the deterioration.
