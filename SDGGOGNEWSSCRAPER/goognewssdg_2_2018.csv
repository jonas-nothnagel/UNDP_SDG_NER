The note provides information on how countries have adapted or established institutional and coordination frameworks to implement the Goals, and highlights efforts to promote horizontal and vertical coherence.

The document titled, ‘Institutional and Coordination Mechanisms: Guidance Note on Facilitating Integration and Coherence for SDG Implementation,’ finds that many countries are adapting and expanding institutional frameworks established during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, such as national councils for sustainable development (NCSDs), for SDG implementation. The note recommends that such institutions should be positioned within the office of the president or prime minister to ensure effective coordination, and should include some form of decentralization, whether by ensuring representation of local focal points in the NCSD or through establishing sub-national bodies. An annex to the note shares country experiences from Germany, Indonesia, and Nigeria.

On new mechanisms and structures, the guidance argues that the scope and ambition of the SDGs requires systems that facilitate cross-sectoral action and shared accountability that traverses ministries, agencies, levels of government and stakeholders. The note shares how countries have created inter-ministerial commissions to oversee SDG implementation, established high-level inter-ministerial committees to bring together sectoral working groups, and established inter-sectoral thematic working groups, or requested ministries to identify their SDG-related responsibilities. Country experiences from Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone illustrate how countries have created new institutional frameworks to implement the SDGs.

The note identifies the functions of an inter-ministerial commission for sustainable development. They include: operating as an advisory body on the SDGs; developing or coordinating implementation strategies on the SDGs; engaging with key stakeholders; developing a national monitoring framework and national indicators; reviewing the SDGs and targets; recommending financing measures for SDG implementation; and preparing for regional and global dialogues on SDG implementation.

The guidance also discusses allocation of responsibility among various levels of government, emphasizing that sub-national and local governments are often responsible for implementation. The note recommends governments promote vertical coherence and integration across government levels by creating explicit institutional links between sustainable development strategies and federal and sub-national processes. The note further recommends, inter alia: maintaining two-way communication; including partners from outside government with local expertise; and matching devolved responsibilities with funds and revenue-raising powers.

Additional sections of the guidance note address, inter alia: promoting an integrated cross-sectoral approach, drawing from national institutions to implement climate interventions; addressing challenges related to SDG monitoring and reporting; and engaging stakeholders. The note underscores the role of parliaments in SDG implementation through their legislative, oversight, and budgetary functions. The document elaborates on opportunities for parliaments to ensure no one is left behind, promote gender equality, support the rights of persons with disabilities, and engage youth populations.

The publication concludes with recommendations on questions countries should consider when adapting or establishing institutional frameworks for SDG implementation. These questions focus on: designation of a key institution to oversee SDG implementation; high-level support for the institution; the institution’s mandate to oversee and coordinate SDG implementation; a sustainable development road map or strategy with clear roles and targets; mechanisms to foster horizontal and vertical coordination; stakeholder engagement; access to decision-making and inclusion of marginalized groups; and mechanisms for arbitration of conflicting views. Finally, the note proposes key structural factors that countries should consider when setting up an institutional mechanism for SDG implementation.

UNDP intends for the note to be a living document that will be updated based on feedback and lessons learned from ongoing SDG implementation.

To address this issue, the UN SDG Action Campaign is encouraging people to engage in SDG implementation and monitoring, while the IAP, a global network of science agencies, has published a guide to the SDGs for its members.

Market research conducted jointly by PepsiCo, Paragon Partnerships, and the UN SDG Action Campaign found that just 5.9% of 10,000 people interviewed in the Philippines were aware of the SDGs, with this percentage falling among lower-income respondents. The survey also found that poverty, hunger and ill health were the issues of most concern to respondents, corresponding to SDGs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The majority of respondents (68.2%) believed that the situation with regard to these concerns had not changed in the past year, while about a quarter (28%) felt the situation had improved.

Commenting on the results of the Philippines survey, Dilek Ozler of Paragon Partnerships expressed hope that more country governments will choose to measure progress and promote SDG implementation. Paragon Partnerships is a network of government, research agencies, NGOs, companies and client organizations that seeks to use data to generate insights for policy making and programme development towards SDG implementation.

The UN SDG Action Campaign is an initiative of the UN Secretary-General administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The campaign supports countries and the UN system to promote public engagement in SDG implementation. Among its activities are the MYWorld 2030 platform for data sharing and citizen engagement and the ‘World We Want’ partnership with civil society for hosting SDG-focused consultations.

Separately, the IAP, a global network of science, engineering and medicine academies, conducted a survey of its members, which likewise found limited awareness of the SDGs. The IAP has published a 20-page guide to “demystify” the structures and processes by which the SDGs are to be implemented, and to encourage scientists to apply their knowledge to the challenge of implementation. The guide titled, ‘Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guide for Merit-Based Academies,’ includes a database of peer-reviewed publications on the SDGs that academies have produced since 2014. The activities are part of a three-year IAP project that began in 2016, and seeks to promote the global science community’s contribution to SDG achievement.

4,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-sanitation-economy-the-new-economy-set-to-tackle-sdg-6-2/,"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Sanitation Economy: The New Economy Set to Tackle SDG 6.2,"The news often reports the desperate lack of access to safe sanitation faced by a staggering 2.3 billion people globally. Around the world, one in three people still lacks access to a toilet, and hundreds of thousands of children die annually from diarrheal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. There is an abundance of heart wrenching stories to share.

To address this challenge, in 2015, the global community adopted a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). Target 6.2 under this Goal calls for, “by 2030, achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation.” This article discusses the untapped opportunity for the private sector to help achieve SDG target 6.2. Not only can business be a part of the solution that provides clean water and sanitation for all, but it can make a profit at the same time.

So, where do we begin? From the outset, overcoming this global issue is daunting. Where do we look for the solution, when the issue includes complex cultural nuances, societal taboos, and the general ‘yuck’ factor?

To start, the global business community and savvy entrepreneurs can take a closer look at the bottom of our toilets. Yes, it may sound unpalatable, but there is method in the madness.

The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

In its latest report, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) introduces the ‘Sanitation Economy‘ – a market that presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses. This new economy monetizes toilet provision, products and services, biological resources, health data and information, to provide benefits across business and society.

This research shows that the market could be worth US$62 billion in India alone, by conservative estimates; it could turn trillions of liters of human waste into valuable biological resources each year; and it could hold a vast reservoir of information about human health.

It is rare today to find white spaces in the economy open for business and innovation, and that address such an urgent global challenge as outlined in SDG 6.

The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies. They include: the Toilet Economy, which encompasses toilet product and service innovation that provides toilets fit for purpose for all environments and incomes; the Circular Sanitation Economy, which means toilet resources (commonly known as human waste) feed into a circular economic system that replaces traditional waste management; and finally, the Smart Sanitation Economy, which involves digitized sanitation systems that optimize data for operating efficiencies, maintenance, plus consumer use and health information insights.

The Toilet Economy

Providing basic access to a toilet and the sanitation systems that safely manage human waste is a serious issue. Access to “sanitation for all” made the least progress during the era of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that spanned from 2000 to 2015. As a result, the world is now watching, and acting, to ensure progress over the next 15 years under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.

The Government of India is leading the way with its ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Clean India Campaign’, which aims to provide universal access to all Indians in just five years (2014-2019), become open defecation-free, and build more than 100 million toilets. The campaign is making swift progress in providing access to toilets and awareness is high among citizens. China is now following in its footsteps.

It is not just national governments rising up. Citizen movements are also encouraging behavior change. In November 2016, the Global Citizen Festival was held in Mumbai, India, to put a spotlight on the need for sanitation for all. About 100,000 citizens gathered to listen to an impressive mix of celebrities, musical artists, and sanitation experts – including Coldplay, JAY-Z, and famous Bollywood stars about the importance of sanitation. In 2017, Bollywood launched ‘Toilet: A Love Story,’ a film about a woman who turns down a marriage proposal until her husband-to-be agrees to buy her a toilet. Such cultural activities help educate people about the importance of sanitation and drive behavior change alongside the creation of toilets.

The Circular Sanitation Economy

The past decade has seen business embrace sustainable development, where private sector practices address growing constraints on resources and new responsibilities for the customers and communities they serve. Leading corporations have found new market opportunities by looking at where their unique value propositions can also address unmet needs, and market failures that underpin the SDGs, where no one is left behind. The circular economy – the mining of waste and available resources to save costs and generate new revenue – is trendy among global businesses.

Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources. If what goes into our toilets has value, those interested in extracting that value will invest in ensuring that the resource is properly managed.

And there is no shortage of this resource. Approximately 7.6 billion people globally create excreta every day, to the tune of 3.8 trillion liters of resources – an amount that is growing with our population growth. These resources, when captured and mined, present very interesting biological resource use cases.

For instance, entrepreneurs and businesses are starting to monetize these resources and are creating valuable products such as nutrient-rich organic fertilizers, electricity, bio-fuel, water, and proteins. All of these products were previously, and in many cases, are still, flushed down the toilet. From manufacturing operations to municipalities, there is growing demand for these new, renewable resources and organic or biological products. They help fill food, fiber, agriculture, animal feed, consumer goods and healthcare needs.

The Smart Sanitation Economy

The future of industry is being shaped by what the World Economic Forum is calling the fourth industrial revolution – a digital economy. This is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Sanitation and toilets have a place here, too. There is a key opportunity now to apply new technologies and digitization to sanitation to create new business opportunities as future sanitation systems are developed. While the Smart Sanitation Economy is the least developed area of the Sanitation Economy to date, we believe that it could be a game changer for how we view our sanitation and toilets into the future. It can provide valuable data and insights on health, and for sanitation system operating efficiencies.

A Call to Action – Making ‘Your Business’ Business

The Sanitation Economy is the business response to a global crisis and resulting market and societal failures. With collaboration and investment on all fronts, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s toilet-related resources and data into valuable, life-saving resources and critical information.

This is our call to action to the global business community – because sanitation is every business’s business. It’s time to step up and be counted.","The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

The IYOR aims to strengthen global awareness of the value of coral reef ecosystems, promote partnerships, and identify and implement effective management strategies for the conservation, sustainable use and resilience of reef ecosystems.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment), the primary threats to coral reefs are rising temperatures, ocean acidification, pollution, plastics and sediments, destructive fishing practices, and overfishing. The UN Action Hub has highlighted that the average period between bleaching events has been cut in half since 1980, with episodes of severe bleaching occurring twice as frequently. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) primarily address the conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs under SDG 14 (life below water).

In conjunction with the IYOR, Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced the nomination of its Great Sea Reef as a Ramsar site. The designation aims to protect large portions of Fiji’s Great Sea Reef from climate change, wastewater and chemical pollution, and other threats. In a statement, Bainimarama said the nomination aims to conserve the area for future generations. A Ramsar site is one designated as a wetland important for global biodiversity conservation and human well-being, and the Convention’s broad definition includes coral reefs.

Pacific reefs are in better shape than many other coral reefs around the world.

Further, UNEP announced the forthcoming launch of an analysis of Pacific coral reef status by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN). The report finds that the structure and types of corals in Pacific reefs are changing, which affects the ecosystem services provided by these reefs, particularly fisheries productivity. Still, the report finds that Pacific reefs are in better shape than many other coral reefs around the world.

UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim also called on the world to combat the decline of coral reefs and address plastic in the world’s oceans. Solheim explained that corals may eat microplastics and larger plastic debris can break or smother corals. He stressed, “This is a make or break year for the world’s coral reefs.” To address marine litter, UNEP has spearheaded the UN Clean Seas campaign, and announced, in October 2017, that Spain had joined, bringing the total number of countries to 32.

Finally, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) Director General, Kosi Latu, called for improved management and protection of coral reefs, urging increased collaboration to “respond to climate change, manage waste, conserve and restore biodiversity and support strong governance.” Latu said SPREP has established a two-year campaign, the Pacific Year of the Reef, to address these issues.

The meeting will take place on 1 February 2018, in New York, US.

Following the adoption of UNGA resolution 68/1 titled, ‘Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 61/16 on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council,’ in 2013, ECOSOC underwent a series of reforms to strengthen the Council. By that resolution, UN Member States must review the arrangements during the 72nd UNGA session.

In their letter to UN Member States on 20 December 2017, co-facilitators Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, and Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, invite delegations to share their views on the timeline and outcome of the review process. They also pose four key questions for the informal meeting on 1 February, addressing: the approach to carry out the review in order to cover the substantive and structural aspects of resolution 68/1; ensuring that the review accounts for related processes without overburdening its focus; ways by which ECOSOC could generate effective “leadership, strategic direction and specific guidance” including through its annual main theme; and suggestions for augmenting the added value of the various interlinked functions of the ECOSOC cycle.

Resolution 68/1 outlines arrangements on ECOSOC’s functions and architecture. Among other provisions, it calls on the Council to: adopt a July-to-July cycle for its programme of work; have a strengthened issues-based approach to enhance its lead role in achieving a balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development; and base its annual programme of work on a main theme that takes into account the role of the Council in promoting sustainable development and enables the Council to promote UN system-wide coherence and coordination. The resolution also outlines arrangements for ECOSOC segments and meetings, including for its operational activities for development segment, its humanitarian affairs segment, its high-level segment, its integration segment, and its coordination and management meetings. The resolution calls on ECOSOC to: continue to strengthen and further promote implementation of the financing for development (FfD) agenda; promote the active participation of Major Groups, NGOs, other relevant stakeholders and regional organizations in the activities of the Council; further promote the integration of youth into its deliberations; and devote time to the specific needs of countries in special situations.

He also provided details on a system-wide strategy for gender equality.

The briefing for UN Member States took place on 16 January 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Opening the briefing, the Secretary-General noted that since he took office in January 2017, several global challenges have intensified: conflicts have deepened and new dangers have emerged; global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at their highest since the Cold War; climate change is moving faster than governments are moving to take action; inequalities are growing; horrific violations of human rights are happening; and nationalism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise.

Guterres highlighted 12 areas of concern where priority action is needed, alongside the empowerment of women everywhere, which he said is a cross-cutting imperative. The 12 areas are:

Promoting a real “new deal” for an equitable globalization, whose benefits are shared with everyone: the Secretary-General urged Member States to respect their financial commitments and to set in place stronger mechanisms that address fiscal evasion and illicit financial flows (IFFs);

Noting that in 2016, for the first time in the last three years, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased and the past five years have been the warmest in history, the Secretary-General called for stepping up climate action and announced that he will hold a climate summit in 2019 to increase momentum;

Taking advantage of global mobility through the adoption of the first Global Compact on Migration;

Taking advantage of advances in technology, while protecting societies from its risks: Guterres noted that the UN will serve as a platform for Member States to come together with the private sector, the scientific community and academia to discuss on how to use the potential and address the risks;

Achieving the peaceful de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;

Deescalating tensions in the Middle East;

Strengthening the UN’s partnership with the African Union (AU);

Pushing back the dangerous tide of nationalism in Europe, and revitalizing mediation initiatives – including the Normandy Format and Trilateral Contact Group on Eastern Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh, the Geneva International Discussions related to Georgia, and the “5+2” process on Transnistria;

Maintaining a strong focus on counter-terrorism: Guterres announced the convening in June 2017 of a Summit of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies to advance multilateral cooperation;

Strengthening UN peace operations: the Secretary-General noted that a detailed plan of action for that purpose is being prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and said that, in February 2018, he will present his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace;

Reversing the large-scale exodus of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, for which the full implementation of the Rakhine Advisory Commission recommendations is vital; and

Overcoming the “false contradiction” between human rights and national sovereignty: Guterres mentioned that the UN stands ready to support states in building their capacities to uphold the rule of law, promote respect for human rights, and eliminate all forms of discrimination.

The Secretary-General noted that his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace to be presented in February will contain “very strong” proposals on strengthening the Peacebuilding Fund. He observed that the AU needs strong support and clear mandates from the UN, and announced that the UN and the AU will sign a framework of agreement on development, aligning the 2030 Agenda and Africa 2063, during the AU Summit taking place at the end of January 2018.

On gender equality, Guterres said his approach rests on three pillars. The first pillar is empowering women and girls. To that end, he noted the September 2017 launch of his roadmap for achieving gender parity at all UN levels, and announced that in 2018 the UN reached full parity in the 44-member UN Senior Management Group. He added that he also mandated an internal task force to review the UN’s spending on gender equality.

The second pillar of his gender equality approach, Guterres said, is preventing sexual exploitation and abuse against women. With this aim, he appointed the UN’s first-ever Victims’ Rights Advocate, who will work closely with Member States and across the UN system. He noted that 82 Member States are part of a Voluntary Compact to prevent these crimes and respond swiftly to allegations.

The third pillar on which Secretary-General’s gender equality approach rests is preventing and addressing sexual harassment. He reiterated his personal commitment to eliminating sexual harassment at the UN, adding that his zero-tolerance approach was recently reaffirmed in a joint letter with staff unions to all UN personnel. He reported that he has set up a task force, led by Jan Beagle of the Department of Management, to review UN policies and capacities to investigate, to ensure accountability, and to look at the support and protection offered to those affected. Guterres said his team is currently working on more detailed measures to simplify the procedures for reporting harassment and raise awareness of the issue throughout the UN.

The Secretary-General added that 2018 will be “a decisive year for reform,” and noted that the repositioning of the UN development system will facilitate better support for Member States in achieving the SDGs.

Countries welcomed a more in-depth definition of “sustaining peace.”

In the ensuing discussion, many countries, including Cuba, Iran and Singapore, stressed the need for the UN to defend and promote multilateralism. Brazil and Cuba noted that reform of the UN peace and security pillar will not be complete without reform of the UN Security Council. Singapore expressed hope that the Secretary-General will act as advocate for an open and fair world trade system. China called for attention to the root causes of the refugee crisis. Guatemala and El Salvador welcomed a more in-depth definition of the “sustaining peace” concept, with El Salvador adding that the concept should include human rights and be addressed under the peace and security pillar.

The platform aims to enable greater cooperation among public and private-sector organizations to close the production-consumption loop, addressing problems of pollution and waste. PACE will contribute to achieving SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production (SCP) by developing solutions for e-waste, plastic pollution and other SCP challenges.

PACE builds on a previous CEO-led initiative under WEF, Project MainStream, which sought to scale up circular economy innovations. PACE has three aims: developing models of blended financing for circular economy projects, especially in developing and emerging economies; creating policy frameworks to address specific barriers to advancing the circular economy; and promoting public-private collaboration for these purposes.

PACE is co-chaired by the CEO of Philips and the heads of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UN Environment. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the International Resource Panel, Circle Economy and Accenture Strategy are knowledge partners in this initiative, and WEF hosts and facilitates the platform. Areas of focus include plastics, electronics, and food and the bio-economy. PACE seeks to transform business models and markets across China, Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa.

Alongside the launch of PACE at WEF, UN Environment announced its cooperation agreement with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The agreement will support joint action by the two organizations to strengthen the scientific basis for policy decisions, including at city level, to decouple economic development from environmental degradation.

Steven Stone, Chief of UN Environment’s Resource & Markets branch, stated that 2018 could be thought of as ‘the Year of Consuming and Producing Sustainably’. The High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (HLPF) will review achievements toward SDG 12 when it meets in New York in July.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a UK-registered not-for-profit organization established in 2010 with the support of several companies including Renault, the National Grid utilities company, and British Telecommunications in cooperation with Cisco. The Foundation’s mission is to promote acceleration toward a circular economy. The Foundation works with business, government and academia to design a ‘restorative and regenerative’ economy.

10,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-issues-vnr-handbook-revised-voluntary-guidelines/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"DESA Issues VNR Handbook, Revised Voluntary Guidelines","January 2018: The UN Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has issued a draft unedited version of a handbook on preparing Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). The handbook provides “basic, practical information” on the steps that countries may take when preparing a VNR, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the UN Secretary-General’s proposal of voluntary common reporting guidelines for VNRs, which were updated in December 2017, and are included in the handbook.

VNRs are part of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are presented annually by UN Member States during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). They are intended to track progress in implementing the SDGs and their targets in all countries in an open, inclusive, participatory and transparent manner.

The ‘Handbook for Preparation of Voluntary National Reviews’ includes sections on: how to initiate a review; organization and preparation of the review; multi-stakeholder participation; key building blocks for preparing the review; preparatory workshops and submission of VNRs; presentation of the VNR at the HLPF; and “after the presentation.” It also features country examples, and a VNR preparation checklist outlining actions related to: initial preparation and organization; stakeholder engagement; VNR preparation; and HLPF presentation.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should not be seen as separate from the implementation of the SDGs, but should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals. On organization and preparation of the review, the handbook notes that for most VNR countries, preparation time is very short, and therefore it is advisable to begin the process as early as possible. The handbook recommends drawing up a work plan or roadmap that covers the main deliverables and deadlines for the national preparatory process. Components of the roadmap could include: the coordination structure for the review; costs of the review and possible sources of funding; scope of the VNR; a list of bodies and agencies that will be providing data and information; key stakeholders to engage and methods of engagement; ways to access to high quality, up-to-date, and disaggregated data; and allocating time for technical editing as well as a high-level review of the VNR and its main messages.

On timeline, the handbook notes that VNR countries should submit their main messages (conclusive summary of the VNR) by 18 May 2018. The final reviews should be submitted to DESA by 18 June 2018.

The handbook states that the preparatory process for the VNRs includes global workshops based on countries’ previous experiences in participating in the VNR process. The workshops are organized by DESA, and are designed to facilitate peer learning and interaction. The handbook indicates that a first global workshop seeks to cover key components of the preparatory process, and involves current and former VNR countries. A second global workshop facilitates the sharing of experiences among VNR countries, including lessons learned and challenges encountered. A third global workshop covers final preparatory matters, and engages countries in a discussion of anticipated follow-up to their VNRs. In preparation for the 2018 VNRs, the first workshop took place in Geneva, Switzerland, in December 2017. The second workshop is planned for early March 2018, in Dakar, Senegal, and the third and final one is scheduled for 15 July 2018, in New York, US, according to the handbook.

The handbook “goes beyond” the UN Secretary-General’s proposed guidelines, the authors note. Those voluntary common reporting guidelines, which are included in an annex to the handbook, provide a framework for the VNR reports, while allowing for flexibility. They were first issued in January 2016, as part of the UN Secretary-General’s report on ‘Critical milestones towards coherent, efficient and inclusive follow-up and review at the global level’ (A/70/684), and were updated in December 2017 based on lessons learned from the VNR experiences in 2016 and 2017. The guidelines comprise sections on: follow-up and review guiding principles; structure and content of the VNR report; and making presentations at the HLPF.

The authors of the handbook also highlight other sources may further assist countries in their preparations, such as the synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs prepared by DESA, and the Guidelines to Support Country Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (2017) prepared by the UN Development Group (UNDG).

In 2018, 48 countries will present their VNRs during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF (16-18 July).

The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has assessed the impacts of air pollution on infants, noting the serious and widespread nature of the problem in South Asia and parts of East Asia and the Pacific. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that antibiotics in the environment are causing the evolution of bacteria into “ferocious superbugs” that pose a major health risk.

A UNICEF report titled, ‘Danger in the Air,’ argues that air pollution ranks with violence, lack of nutrition and lack of stimulation in terms of its impacts on infant health. The authors call for action to reduce air pollution, reduce children’s exposure to air pollution and improve child health overall. To reduce air pollution, they suggest investing in clean energy, improving access to public transport, increasing green spaces in urban areas and preventing the open burning of harmful chemicals. To limit children’s exposure to air pollution, they recommend the use of child-sized air filtration masks, traveling during lower air pollution times of day, and planning for pollution sources to be located away from schools, clinics and hospitals. In addition, the authors call for improved monitoring of air pollution to better understand the scale and nature of the problem.

A UNEP report titled, ‘Frontiers 2017: Issues of Emerging Concern,’ reviews emerging issues of environmental concern, and with regard to health, identifies antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as “one of the biggest global public health concerns” of the 21st century. The publication describes how antibiotic use has greatly increased in human health care, animal husbandry and aquaculture, as well as how these drugs enter the environment and contribute to the evolution of bacteria into strains that resist treatment. The report recommends tackling the release of antimicrobial drugs, contaminants and resistant bacteria into the environment, and ensuring proper use and disposal of antibiotic pharmaceuticals. UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim, speaking at the report launch during the third session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-3) in December 2017, warned that the careless use of antibiotics is leading to the rise of “ferocious superbugs.”

The ‘Frontiers 2017’ report also discusses nanomaterials, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), sand and dust storms, off-grid electricity, and tackling the environmental drivers and impacts of migration.

The UN System Staff College (UNSSC) with the Data-Pop Alliance launched a platform offering online courses on big data in November 2017, and will conduct face-to-face trainings in 2018. The UN Statistics Division with the GIS software company Esri have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to monitor progress on the SDGs.

The Data-Pop Alliance is a coalition of research and development actors created by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, MIT Media Lab, and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to promote the use of big data for sustainable development through research, capacity building, and community engagement. UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are seeking to promote data literacy within the UN and other development practitioners. Their learning platform, the ‘Big Data & Sustainable Development Open Learning Hub,’ offers a series of eight consecutive modules over 11 months. The online modules became available in November 2017 and will run until mid-September 2018. The first module covered issues of governance, transparency and politics related to the use of big data, and subsequent modules will address: climate change; citizen-generated and mobile phone data; gender equity; public health; emergency response; data collection, gaps and opportunities; and data storytelling and visualization. The program can be accessed by anyone who creates a profile on the learning hub.

UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are also offering in-person training on ‘Leveraging Big Data for Sustainable Development.’ The training is conducted over three to four days, and is offered in French and English at various locations around the world. A French-language programme will take place in Dakar, Senegal, from 6-8 March 2018, and an English-language programme in Bangkok, Thailand, from 27-29 March 2018. The training programme is meant to strengthen the skills of UN staff and development practitioners in selecting, creating, using and interpreting data in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Hewlett Foundation is supporting fellowships to cover the costs of the course to professionals from public sector institutions, civil society and academia.

On 30 November 2017, the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management endorsed the concept of a “federated system” of open SDG Data Hubs. The federated system facilitates the role of national statistical offices (NSOs) in managing statistical and geospatial data through an open data platform with software for GIS and data analytics, as well as through the use of web-based tools for communication and user engagement. It seeks to strengthen national and global statistical systems in managing and sharing data and good practices in implementing the SDGs, improving data interoperability, and enhancing relationships between national and global data. The concept has been implemented through initial research conducted by the UN Statistics Division (UNStats) and Esri, which have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to collect, analyze and share data for monitoring progress on the SDGs.

Also on big data, Emmanuel Letouzé and David Sangokoya of the Data-Pop Alliance have proposed a 12-point plan addressing privacy issues in big data. In a paper titled, ‘How to Use Big Data,’ developed in cooperation with the Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications, the authors recommend that collected data be encrypted and stored in distributed data repositories, where it can only be accessed for legitimate purposes. They call for directing big data projects and resources toward solving shared problems, and for communicating results of projects through data visualizations.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa welcomed the Portal as a gateway that will “provide transparency and and broaden participation in the Talanoa Dialogue.”

The Portal will be open throughout 2018 for submissions from all countries and other stakeholders, including business, investors, cities, regions and civil society on three central questions: Where are we?

The report ranks 16 of the world’s largest publicly listed auto companies on readiness for a low carbon transition.

The companies included in the report titled, ‘Driving Disruption: Which automotive companies will seize the opportunities in a low-carbon economy?’, have a total market capitalization of US$790 billion and represent over 75% of the global passenger vehicle market. According to CDP’s ranking, BMW, Daimler and Toyota are the best performing car companies on climate-related metrics.

The authors explain that the car industry is “facing a double hit of disruption from EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous and shared driving,” with over a fifth of profits likely to shift to technology companies like Uber and Google by 2030. Over 30% of new car sales are projected to be zero emissions and plug-in hybrid by 2030, representing a potential US$1 trillion market. By 2022, EVs could become as affordable as petrol and diesel cars, making it easier for car makers to profit from a low-carbon economy. Accelerating the deployment of such vehicles is critical for reducing carbon emissions meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

CDP CEO Paul Simpson said technology and software disrupters have forced the car industry to innovate quickly to ensure their survival in the low-carbon transition. Traditional car companies are increasingly investing (over US$11 billion since 2015) in autonomous and shared vehicle companies, and setting aggressive electric and autonomous vehicle targets. For example, General Motors is working towards an ‘All Electric-future.’ However, nearly 50% of car makers risk penalties by missing their emissions targets, and in the EU, some companies will need to increase their share of EV sales by 20% in order to meet the EU’s 2021 targets.

For traditional car engines, complying with emissions regulations will increase to over US$2,200 per vehicle by 2025.

The report details a number of risks and opportunities for the car industry. For example, governance and remuneration structures must be aligned with the low carbon transition, and the cost to comply with emissions regulations for traditional car engines is expected to increase threefold by 2025 to over US$2,200 per vehicle. In addition, China is critical, says CDP, as it accounts for 29% of global passenger vehicle sales, and has set aggressive targets for new energy vehicles such as EVs beginning in 2019.

CDP leverages investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage environmental impacts, and drive companies and governments to reduce their emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. CDP has reported on the oil and gas, steel, cement, automotive, electric utilities, chemicals and mining industries in recent years.

The overarching goal of the call for proposals under the fourth project cycle of the Benefit-sharing Fund is the conservation and use of adapted plant varieties that would lead to increased productivity, on-farm incomes, and nutrient-rich food, as well as enhanced resilience to production shocks and reduced adverse impacts to the environment. Eligible applicants include governmental and non-governmental organizations, including farmers and farmers’ organizations, genebanks and research institutions, as well as regional and international organizations based in developing countries that are Contracting Parties to the International Treaty. At least US$5 million will be invested in projects over the next four years.

The projects are expected to also contribute towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Projects selected for Benefit-sharing Fund support under this call for proposals will focus on responding to the needs of the poorest, most vulnerable segments of society, and those furthest behind in terms of development,” said Kent Nnadozie, Secretary of the International Treaty, who also noted that, “By responding to the needs of these segments of society, the projects are expected to also contribute towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”

The deadline for submitting pre-proposals is 1 March 2018. A helpdesk will be offering practical and technical information to support applicants throughout the call for proposals. Applications will be assessed by an independent panel of experts against pre-established criteria, including experience and capacity of applicant organizations to contribute towards the programme goals, outcomes, and targets.

To date, the International Treaty’s Benefit-sharing Fund has invested more than US$20 million in 61 projects across 55 developing countries over three project cycles. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) estimates that it has positively impacted the lives of approximately 1 million people. Projects have supported the development, testing and use of climate ready crops, resulting in over 3,000 food crop varieties now available to the international scientific and breeding community under the International Treaty’s Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing.

The report stresses that a change in mindset and perspective is necessary to achieve sustainable development for all. It proposes a nexus approach to overcome barriers between sectors and disciplines, and ensure sustainable natural resource management.

The report titled, ‘From Isolation to Integration: Five Years of Advancing a Nexus Approach to Environmental Resource Management,’ introduces the nexus approach to resource management, which examines the interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales. The report argues that considering these relationships can increase resource efficiency while minimizing ecological degradation and environmental risks. Conversely, the report cautions that failure to consider inter-connectedness can result in adverse impacts.

As an illustration, the report shares how a project in China mitigated soil erosion but contributed to food and water scarcity. In this context, the project achieved progress on SDG 15 (life on land) but hindered progress on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). The report argues that understanding these interlinkages can help develop strategies for achieving multiple SDGs. It provides an example of a wastewater treatment project in Mexico City that aims to address progress on SDG 2, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 6 and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The report identifies knowledge and capacity gaps in moving from isolation to integration. These gaps include the need for more rigorous research and examples to develop policy recommendations and development of independent, reliable and current data to identify linkages and analyze the effects of management strategies. The report further suggests development of guidelines for decision-makers to implement inter-ministerial and cross-ministerial collaboration and implementation. The report elaborates on ways to address each of these gaps based on UNU-FLORES’ experience.

The report’s recommendations center on research, data, tools, capacity development, networking and advocacy. Each of these focuses on ways to implement a more holistic approach to resource management. The report also provides information on UNU-FLORES’ research projects that elaborate the connections between water, soil and waste planning, management and trade-offs.

Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra made the call in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, California, US.

Mahindra, who will co-chair the GCAS, said approximately 500 companies are expected to “step up and commit to set science-based targets” by the September summit. He commended the more than 330 companies that have already committed to align their strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through the Science Based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that helps companies determine how much they must cut emissions to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Almost 900 more companies have announced their intent to set science-based targets within the next two years in their CDP disclosures, indicating a “new normal” in the way businesses are developing future strategies, according to the We Mean Business Coalition.

Mahindra said that businesses can “future-proof growth” and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting science-based targets, which also shows governments that businesses are serious about aligning their strategies with the Paris Agreement.

This call, made during the 48th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, which convened from 23-26 January 2018, is the first of multiple ‘Summit Challenges,’ which are expected in advance of the GCAS. Such challenges aim to help deliver GHG reductions to help ensure global emissions start “trending downward” no later than 2020, as well as to help the Summit contribute to an energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth. The GCAS aims to showcase such climate action and new commitment in advance of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 24) in November 2018.

In his statement, Mahindra also sought to dispel the idea a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing profits, among other “persistent myths” about business action on climate change. He explained that initiatives to reduce emissions have generated a return, and in the last five years, his company has saved 58 million KWh of energy, which could power 15,000 homes in India. He added that climate change represents a US$6 trillion financial opportunity over the next two decades.

Also at the WEF, French President Emmanuel Macron committed to shutting down France’s coal-fired power stations by 2021. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted climate change as one of the three most significant challenges to civilization, along with terrorism and the backlash against globalization. The Climate Group released the ‘RE100 Progress and Insights Report: Approaching a Tipping Point: How corporate users are redefining global electricity markets,’ which notes that 25 members of RE100 reached 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2016. Over 30 companies across 16 sectors and with a combined revenue of US$1.3 trillion will accelerate implementation of circular economy solutions through Factor 10, an initiative of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

19,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-blended-finance-and-private-sector-contributions-to-the-sdgs/,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Blended Finance and Private Sector Contributions to the SDGs,"How will we finance sustainable development? In last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, we saw the possibilities that blockchain technology holds for development finance. This week’s brief considers where and how private sector actors can contribute to SDG achievement, including through blended finance.

Blended finance is the use of public or philanthropic investment to attract commercial finance from the private sector, particularly to fund activities in developing countries. The private sector contains many types of entities: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), multinational corporations (MNCs), institutional investors, individuals, and everything in between. A working paper by Convergence and the Business & Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Task Force tackles a subset of the question posed in its title, ‘Who is the private sector?’ The paper focuses on six types of institutional investors: pension funds; insurance companies; sovereign wealth funds; commercial and investment banks; private equity firms; and asset/wealth managers. The authors then consider how to mobilize capital from such institutional investors, through blended finance. Recommendations address: 1) engagement, 2) designing appropriate products and scaling successful solutions, 3) building off development finance institutions (DFIs) capabilities and experience, and 4) disseminating return and impact data.

Also from the Blended Finance Task Force, in partnership with the Business & Sustainable Development Commission and SYSTEMIQ, comes ‘Better Finance, Better World.’ This consultation paper says that institutional investors can leverage the current low-interest rate environment to use blended finance in a manner that de-risks investment in emerging markets infrastructure. The paper also notes the central role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and DFIs, but calls on both to increase their mobilization ratios. The paper highlights that MDBs currently mobilize less than US$1 of private capital per dollar invested. A write-up of the two papers on ImpactAlpha by Convergence’s Justice Durland looks at “ways to get the private sector to start paying attention” to the SDGs. Coverage of the second paper is also available on Public Finance International.

Eurodad’s Polly Meeks authored a piece, also on Public Finance International, asking whether blended finance is “a silver bullet or a double-edged sword” and noting the opportunity costs of blended finance. The article responds to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) ‘Private Finance for Sustainable Development’ conference, hosted on 29 January 2018, in Paris, France. The event, covered by Devex’s Molly Anders, launched an OECD report titled, ‘Making Blended Finance Work for the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The report notes blended finance’s potential for delivering the US$2.5 trillion annual investment needed to achieve the SDGs. It highlights that donor governments and other development actors are increasingly using blended finance, but acknowledges that “a critical first step” is simply agreeing on a common definition.

Lastly on blended finance, the Brookings Institution’s Emily Gustafsson-Wright asks, ‘Is paying for results with blended finance ready to take off?’ The post, featured on Brookings’ Education Plus Development blog, quotes Davos attendees’ remarks on the potential for innovative financing models, and evaluates the extent to which blended finance has been used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. Gustafsson-Wright looks at a range of case studies, including payment by results, social and development impact bonds, and other efforts by bilateral and multilateral donors. She concludes that there is indeed something to be said for blended finance, whose elements can enable more effective investment in prevention, incentivize collaboration, build a culture of monitoring and evaluation, and empower countries to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

The SDGs can serve as an investment tool for “putting value on values.”

Blended finance is not the only way for the private sector to support the SDGs. Thomson Reuters delves into other roles for private companies in article titled, ‘Can you use the SDGs as an investment tool?’ The post discusses opportunities to use environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics as a basis to develop investment strategies in manner that is consistent with, or centered around, the SDGs. The piece references a prior webinar and summary report on how the SDGs can serve as “a new tool for putting value on values.”

GreenBiz Group’s Anya Khalamayzer also looks at ESG opportunities aligned with the SDGs, through the lens of retirement and pension funds. The post highlights an aspirational goal by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to move US$10 billion in retirement assets under management of its member companies into ESG-themed retirement benefit accounts by 2020. Last week, together with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), WBCSD also launched draft guidance on applying Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ESG-related risks.

Private sector engagement with the SDGs featured broadly at GreenBiz 18, GreenBiz Group’s annual conference, which convened from 6-8 February 2018, in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions on Materiality and Metrics discussed three types of contributions to the 2030 Agenda: “the potential of business to realize the SDGs;” navigating the reporting landscape; and SDG achievement through improved soil health. A WBCSD-moderated GreenBiz tutorial highlights what businesses can do with respect to the SDGs, covering employment opportunities, technological innovation, and, as discussed above, finance.

Also on measuring business contributions, the SDG Compass has been updated with new indicators, according to the Global Reporting Initiative. SDG Compass is a joint product of GRI, WBCSD and UN Global Compact that provides guidance to companies on aligning strategies and measuring contributions to the SDGs.

A UBS white paper titled, ‘Partnerships for the Goals,’ explores opportunities for wealth managers to collaborate with MDBs, financial services firms, UBS’s clientele, and social enterprises, in order to mobilize the estimated US$5-7 trillion of annual investment needed to meet the SDGs. The paper calls on wealth managers to take action in five areas: 1) working more closely with MDBs, 2) standardizing sustainable and impact investing conventions, 3) working together to “fashion new solutions that fill gaps in the SDG-funding instrument landscape,” 4) focusing on outcomes and impacts, in partnership with philanthropic clients, and 5) working with social entrepreneurs and introducing them to their stakeholders.

An upcoming SDG Knowledge Weekly brief will explore the role of public finance in making the SDGs a reality, as the international community gears up for meetings on tax collaboration, infrastructure, and follow-up to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FFD.

20,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/halting-deforestation-from-aspiration-to-action/,"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Halting Deforestation: From Aspiration to Action,"Imagine an area the size of Belgium, blanketed by forests and trees which provide food, fuel, medicine, shelter, and incomes for local habitants while conserving soil and water for farms and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.

Now, imagine that area stripped entirely of its trees. This is the amount of forest area lost to the world each year. The total cost of this deforestation is immeasurable, with impacts extending far beyond the forest itself.

Once forests and trees have disappeared, so too will the integrity of the soil and water systems they supported — often permanently. Approximately 75% of all freshwater for farms, industry and homes comes from forests and wetlands. Forests also sequester more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem, and when they are destroyed, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, impacting adversely on the global climate.

Deforestation’s negative impacts for people and the environment are thus far-reaching and serious. Increased forest loss also means that, without major corrections in land use, the world will fail to meet crucial global targets, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Deforestation threatens achievement of forestry targets under the Goals, as well as SDGs on eradicating hunger and poverty, preserving health and fighting climate change — which rely heavily on the goods and services that forests provide.

To put this degree of interdependence into perspective, we need to look at SDG 15 on ‘Life on Land.’ In July, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards this Goal, which calls for, by 2020, promoting the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and substantially increasing afforestation and reforestation globally. These are highly ambitious targets. SDG 15 requires the world to ensure that through the sustainable management of forests, we also protect biodiversity; restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; and halt and reverse land degradation.

None of these measures can be achieved if forests are not at the heart of policies, development strategies, and actions that go far beyond the forest sector.

This is because many drivers of deforestation lie outside the forest sector and are rooted in wider social and economic issues, including challenges related to reducing poverty, and policies that favor land uses that produce higher and more rapid financial returns, including energy, mining, transportation, and agriculture.

Further, a growing world population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 makes it critically important to find ways to feed people while maintaining and expanding forests to meet other human needs.

This can be done.

Research published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has shown how, over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover. Food production can expand through agricultural intensification and other important policy measures. Ghana, Tunisia, and Viet Nam are just a few examples from very different countries that all show strong results when decision-makers coordinate policies across sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, land-use planning, and rights to land tenure.

Over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover.

Sharing expertise and increasing awareness is a critical part of this process. Governments at all levels must work closely with indigenous peoples, community representatives, private-sector associations, and international organizations. Corporate responsibility commitments by large companies operating in the agricultural sector are equally important. An inclusive and broad engagement can lead to a re-evaluation of the role of forests in agriculture production. Innovative technology must be shared and applied to a greater degree, international financial instruments and private-public partnerships considered, and governance issues, including tenure, reviewed.

There is no time to waste. Halting and reversing deforestation globally presents an enormous challenge and will require both political will and concerted action across all sectors at all levels. This effort may influence pivotal decisions expected this year when the HLPF takes stock of progress toward the SDGs in July. This will, in turn, influence follow-up actions by States, business, and civil-society partners at all levels. With collective action now, we can address the global challenge of deforestation, achieve our targets, and ensure that the world today, and in the future, continues to enjoy all of the goods and services that forests provide.

The report assesses LDCs’ economic trends and progress towards selected SDG targets and indicators.

Only five LDCs reached the SDG 8.1 ambition of sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in 2017.

The 2018 report titled, ‘Selected Sustainable Development Trends in the Least Developed Countries,’ was presented to UNCTAD Member States at a meeting of its governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, on 5 February 2018. The assessment finds that LDCs economic growth averaged 5% in 2017, and should reach 5.4% in 2018, which is below SDG target 8.1 on sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the LDCs. According to the report, in 2017, only five LDCs achieved this target: Bangladesh (7.1% GDP growth), Djibouti (7.0% GDP growth), Ethiopia (8.5% GDP growth), Myanmar (7.2% GDP growth) and Nepal (7.5% GDP growth).

The report shows that aid to LDCs remains far below the target of 0.15-0.20% of donor countries’ official development assistance (ODA)/gross national income (GNI), a level that was agreed in 1981 and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development in 2015. It notes that in 2016, only a handful of donor countries appear to have met these commitments: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK provided over 0.20% of their own GNI to LDCs, while the Netherlands met the 0.15% threshold.

The report also shows that aid tends to be skewed towards a relatively small pool of LDCs, with the top ten recipients accounting for roughly half of total disbursements to the group. The top recipients are often the countries most affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict, the authors find.

The assessment indicates that levels of external indebtedness have been surging across LDCs, and in 2016, remittances accounted for as much as 31% of GDP in Nepal, 29% in Haiti, 26% in Liberia, 22% in the Gambia, 21% in the Comoros, 15% in Lesotho, and they exceeded 10% of GDP in Senegal, Yemen and Tuvalu. It also finds that many LDCs fall short of the inclusive and sustainable industrialization envisaged in SDG target 9.2 (Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in LDCs).

Comprehensive and updated economic and social statistical data on the LDCs can be accessed in UNCTAD’s ‘Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries – 2017.’ [Publication: Selected Sustainable Development Trends in The Least Developed Countries] [UNCTAD Press Release on Report] [UN Press Release on Report] [UNCTAD’s Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries 2017]","8 February 2018: A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) suggests that the least developed countries (LDCs) will not reach the SDGs unless key action is taken, including speeding up wholesale restructuring of their economies.

Parties called for urgent action and effective mechanisms at national and regional levels to implement the Convention.

African nations established the ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’ in 1991 to protect the health of Africa’s population and its environment by banning the import of all hazardous and radioactive waste. The Convention prohibits dumping or incinerating hazardous waste in inland water and oceans, promotes the control of transboundary movement of hazardous waste within Africa, and seeks to ensure that waste disposal is conducted in an environmentally sound manner. Out of 54 African countries, 25 have ratified the Convention, which came into force in 1998.

Over 35 countries, regional economic bodies and other stakeholders participated in COP 2. The meeting convened from 30 January to 1 February 2018, in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, under the theme, ‘The Bamako Convention: a platform for a pollution-free Africa.’

Parties reaffirmed their ambition to prevent Africa from becoming a dumping ground for toxic wastes.

In the Ministerial Declaration, Parties raised concerns on the limited progress made in implementing the Convention. They reaffirmed their commitment to take concrete, urgent action to implement decisions adopted at COP 1 and COP 2. Parties also reaffirmed their ambition to protect vulnerable groups from unsafe chemical use and unsound waste disposal, and to take actions to prevent Africa from becoming a dumping ground for toxic wastes.

The Declaration further reaffirms Parties’ support for the environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes through the Convention, including through efforts to align the Bamako Convention with the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063 and the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) resolutions on chemicals and pollution. Parties called for promoting coherence and synergies between the Convention and other conventions related to chemical and hazardous waste, and for conducting joint capacity building activities and research programmes. In her remarks at the meeting, Juliette Biao, UN Environment Programme, underlined that strengthening the Bamako Convention will “reinforce Africa’s role and commitment to the global chemical agenda” as well as to Agenda 2063 and the SDGs.

COP 2 decided to establish the Convention Secretariat in Mali, and requested the Government of Mali and the current Secretariat to develop a road map on the establishment of a permanent secretariat and to report on the status at an Extra-Ordinary meeting of the COP to be held in Sudan in early 2019.

Leaders highlighted the role of political will, community engagement and targeted investment in changing practices and lives, stressing that FGM can and must be stopped.

The Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality (SDG 5) target 5.3 aims to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM by 2030. According to the UN, global prevalence of FGM has declined nearly one-quarter since 2000 but the rate of progress is insufficient to keep up with population growth, meaning that the number of total cases is expected to continue to increase without additional action. In addition, by 2030, one-third of births globally will be in the 30 FGM countries, a trend that will require accelerated progress to protect women and girls from this practice.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.”

In his message for the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.” He called for accelerating progress on SDG target 5.3, saying that, without immediate action, “a further 68 million girls could be subjected to this practice by 2030.” Guterres stressed, “sustainable development cannot be achieved without full respect for the human rights of women and girls.”

In a joint statement for the Day, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Natalaia Kanem described FGM as a “violation of human rights that both reflects and perpetuates the low status of girls and women” and can cause infection, childbirth complications and death. The leaders highlighted building momentum to eliminate FGM, observing that over 25 million people in more than 18,000 communities across 15 countries have disavowed the practice of FGM since 2008. Fore and Kanem stressed that ending the practice helps girls to grow up healthier, better educated and employed, and more empowered to make decisions about their lives.

In countries where UNICEF and UNFPA work jointly to end FGM, the UN finds that girls are one-third less likely to undergo FGM than in 1997. The UNICEF and UNFPA Executive Directors highlighted conditions that help to end FGM, including when governments, communities and families address the issue; when women and girls are empowered to make their voices heard; when villages confront social norms; when access to education, health and legal services support sustainable change; when medical professionals refuse to perform FGM; or when laws make FGM a crime and authorities enforce the law.

According to the UN Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC), many women and girls in European countries are also subjected to FGM, particularly migrants from countries where FGM is practiced. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 20,000 women and girls coming from countries that practice FGM apply for asylum in European member states annually, including for reasons related to FGM. UNRIC explains that FGM continues to exist among migrant groups after migration to Europe, with girls particularly at risk when they temporarily return to their country of origin during holidays.

The Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, said the FGM “is not acceptable in the 21st century” in her remarks at an international forum in the Gambia on strategies to combat FGM. Gambia banned FGM in November 2015. Wickramanayake called on countries to address gaps in their legal frameworks to end the practice of FGM.

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

26,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/small-states-emphasize-finance-partnerships/,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Small States Emphasize Finance, Partnerships","7 December 2017: Small States face a “triple trap” of climate impacts, high fossil fuel prices and high levels of indebtedness, according to discussions at the Small States Forum. Forum Chair Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, released the summary of the 2017 Forum.

The annual high-level event took place on 14 October 2017, in Washington, DC, US, during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings. The Forum gathered heads of government, ministers and central bank governors from small States, as well as representatives of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth Secretariat, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the IMF. The 2017 edition of the Forum marked the first time that private sector institutions participated at a large scale, including Swiss Re, World Economic Forum, Bitt.com and the World Ocean Council.

The four main issues raised during the 2017 Small States Forum, according to the summary, are: vulnerability; International Development Association (IDA18) implementation; de-risking; and partnerships. The summary also highlights the importance of mobilizing public and private sector financing for renewable energy, for green and blue economies, and for technology. Also, according to the summary, Forum Members welcomed the ‘Roadmap for World Bank Group Engagement with Small States,’ which was prepared by the World Bank in May 2017.

On vulnerability, participants underlined that small States’ susceptibility to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, frames the challenge of quickly mobilizing and disbursing considerable financial resources to countries that may not have easy access to concessional development finance. The World Bank can mobilize finance quickly in the aftermath of an emergency and provide additional resources for countries that otherwise would not be eligible for it, including by using the IDA Crisis Response Window and creative price buy-downs using trust fund resources. However, the Members noted, some vulnerable small States, such as Nauru and Palau, are unable to access either IDA or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, as they neither qualify for the IDA small States exception nor meet the credit standard for IBRD. They called on the World Bank to explore financing solutions for such vulnerable small States that “fall through the cracks.”

On the IDA18 implementation, participants welcomed the “massive increase” in IDA resources available for eligible small States (US$1.9 billion, which is more than double the previous allocation), noting that for some countries, the IDA allocation has quadrupled. The Forum observed that the challenge is to now find transformative projects that can absorb and make the most of these extra resources. The summary explains the need to focus efforts on preparation, front-loading and fast-tracking (available) development financing, and using innovative financial instruments and creating new partnerships to mobilize additional public and private sector resources.

On de-risking, the Forum noted that as financial institutions seek to “de-risk,” they are causing the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships in small States. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda proposed the establishment of a working group to address the development challenges of de-risking for small States.

Participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and nontraditional partnerships.

On partnerships, participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and non-traditional partnerships. Development partners agreed to continue working together to improve opportunities for small States to access development finance that reduces their vulnerability to shocks.

Several private sector innovative mechanisms were also discussed, including: a new form of blockchain technology that builds direct financial connections to manage remittances and address the challenge of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relations; private insurance that acts as a financial shock absorber, providing fiscal space during natural disasters; and technology to ensure the traceability of tuna so that small States can significantly increase their revenue.

The Guidelines were prepared under the auspices of the World Water Data Initiative of the High Level Panel on Water, as part of global efforts to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and other SDG targets that rely on the development and management of water resources. They were launched by Australia’s ambassador to Italy, Greg French.

The publication comprises 12 chapters that discuss, inter alia, how to: identify different types of water data and their uses; prioritize water management objectives; strengthen water data institutions; establish sustainable water data monitoring systems; adopt water data standards; and implement effective water data information systems.

Lack access to safe sanitation services results in the “entirely preventable deaths” of nearly 1,000 children per day.

Making the case for water reform globally, the Guidelines highlight the growing risk posed by deteriorating water security, due to a combination of factors that include rapid population growth and industrialization, over-extraction, widespread pollution and climate change. The publication notes that more than 1.8 billion people globally source some of their drinking water from contaminated sources, while 2.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation services, “resulting in the entirely preventable deaths of nearly 1,000 children daily.”

In the closing chapter, the publication offers practical guidance for planning and implementing the “water data reform journey,” by discussing how to: take stock of current policy settings; prepare the case for reform; position for effective implementation; and champion the reforms.

The High Level Panel on Water was established in 2016 by the UN Secretary-General and President of the World Bank Group. Comprising 11 sitting Heads of State and Government and one Special Adviser, the Panel aims to provide the leadership required to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources, and improving water- and sanitation-related services.

Hawai’i will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge.

The Hawai’i State Senate aims to focus on a local platform to implement the SDGs during the 2018 Legislative Session. The 2018 Senate Legislative Program outlines Hawai’i’s goals for each of the 17 SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the Program states that Hawai’i will ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have “equal rights to economic resources by implementing and enacting appropriate measures and social protection systems.” On SDG 14 (life below water), Hawai’i will continue its commitment to strengthen its “resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters” in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change. On SDG 15 (life on land), Hawai’i aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of its “’āina and natural resources by integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into local and state planning.”

The Senate will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge, a local sustainability framework that aims to improve the quality of life for future generations. The Aloha+ Challenge focuses on achieving sustainability goals in clean energy, local food production, natural resource management, solid waste reduction, smart and sustainable communities, and green workforce and education. The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard tracks Hawai’i’s progress in these areas. On natural resource management, the Dashboard focuses on increased freshwater capacity, watershed area, marine managed areas, invasive species control and native species management and notes whether each area is being measured or is near its target. For example, on watershed area, Hawai’i is near the 2030 target of 253,000 areas of native watershed under high-level protection. The state has increased is protection of priority watersheds from 10% (90,000 acres) to 15% (132,000 acres) since 2011, and has plans for tripling the areas protected. For each of these areas, the Dashboard provides information on how users can learn more about the issue and contribute to making a difference.

On local food production and consumption, the Dashboard describes current challenges Hawai’i faces in developing a sustainable local food system and outlines the state’s goal of doubling local food production by 2030 by building on Hawai’i’s history of agricultural innovation and abundance. Users can track progress by dairy, protein, vegetables, fruit and starches.

J. Kalani English, Hawaiian Senate Majority Leader, said the 17 SDGs will “continue to build a more resilient state and improve the quality of life for future generations.” In the introduction to the legislative program, he stresses that Hawai’i is recognized as a “global leader in addressing sustainability and climate change challenges, building on a history of systems-thinking and traditional knowledge.” [Hawai’i Senate Press Release] [Hawai’i 2018 Senate Legislative Program] [Aloha+ Challenge]","17 January 2018: The Hawai’i State Senate announced its intention to enact the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into state law to achieve the sustainability of Hawai’i’s people, communities, natural resources and economic prosperity.

It also supported a focus on helping vulnerable groups to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Commission agreed on four draft resolutions, which will be forwarded to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

CSocD 56 convened from 29 January-7 February 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Commission focused on the theme, ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all’ and addressed both the drivers of poverty and recommendations to tackle poverty.

In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed welcomed achievements in reducing extreme poverty, providing access to health care and education and promoting the empowerment of women, youth, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and older persons. She cautioned, however, that progress on extreme poverty remains uneven “across regions, within countries and between various social groups.” She underscored the need to address such inequality and unemployment and underemployment among the world’s youth.

On poverty, the Commission discussed the role of strategies for poverty eradication in achieving sustainable development for all. Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions “remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.” Equatorial Guinea for the African Group said 390 million Africans remain “mired in extreme poverty,” despite commitments to eradicate poverty. Participants recognized the role of natural disasters, conflicts, civil unrest and economic slow-downs in driving poverty.

On social protection, many supported both universal health care (UHC) and social services for all. Mohammed said 45% of the people around the world who need social protection have access to only one benefit. She called for social policies and protection that ensure everyone shares the benefits of economic growth and globalization.

Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, observed that many people remain at risk of falling back into poverty if impacted by a disaster, illness, job loss or lack of social protection. He recommended developing a comprehensive and integrated socioeconomic policy framework. A representative from Malawi shared his country’s cash transfer programme and holistic approach to implementing the SDGs.

On vulnerable populations, participants advocated for prioritizing the rights of older persons, youth, rural people and others in special situations. The International Federation of Associations of the Elderly said elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of disasters and impacts from conflicts and wars, and recommended managing older populations’ post-traumatic stress from such crises. The International Relations Students’ Association of McGill University, Canada, the only student‑run group that has consultative status with ECOSOC, called for taking youth voices into account in decisions on environmental change, energy, food security and migration.

Many participants echoed this call for the participation of youth in decision-making, stressing that youth can help to advance the 2030 Agenda and play a role in improving the use of science, technology and innovation (STI) and increasing transparency. Others highlighted: the importance of investments in early childhood education; the role of risk management and insurance in building resilience, especially in the context of climate change and natural disasters; and the potential of access to information and communications technology (ICT) in increasing the independence of persons with disabilities or older persons with mobility challenges.

On UN reform, Mohammed observed that the Commission can support the UN Secretary-General’s current efforts to reposition the UN development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. She said the Commission’s resolution on its methods of work can support these efforts, and emphasized the Commission’s continued role as a space for policy debate and exchange of experiences.

CSocD 56 agreed on a draft resolution on the Commission’s future organization and methods of work. By the text, governments decide that the Commission will focus on a single priority theme at each future session, leading to an action-oriented resolution with recommendations to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The resolution proposes the 2019 priority theme of ‘Addressing inequalities and challenges to social inclusion through fiscal, wage and social protection policies.’

The resolution titled, ‘Third review and appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002′ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.3), recognizes the contribution of older persons to implementing the SDGs, and encourages States to consider the health, care and well-being of older persons in their national SDG implementation. The Commission further agreed on resolutions on: ‘Social dimensions of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.4); and ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all.’

Four high-level panel discussions convened throughout CSocD 56, including a high-level panel that discussed evidence-based mainstreaming of disability in the 2030 Agenda. Another high-level panel focused on the UN Secretary-General’s report on the Madrid review on aging. The report identifies trends and obstacles to implementation of the Plan around the world. Other panel discussions addressed sustainable and resilient societies, including the role of technology for social need and social good, and of innovative ICT in the 2030 Agenda.

The study – entitled How to report on the SDGs: What good looks like and why it matters – reviews corporate reporting on the SDGs from the world’s largest 250 companies (G250) and assesses it against nine SDG reporting quality criteria.

KPMG’s research finds that within two years of the SDGs being launched in 2015, four in ten (40 percent) top companies acknowledged the global goals in their corporate reporting. Of these, 84 percent identified the SDGs they consider most relevant to their business.

However, less than one in ten has reported a business case for action on the SDGs (8 percent) or has set specific and measurable (SMART) business performance targets related to the global goals (only 10 percent).

Adrian King, a lead author of the study and KPMG’s Global Lead for Sustainability Reporting & Assurance, said:

“There are huge business opportunities inherent in tackling the world’s toughest problems, but so far only a handful of big companies have shown they understand that. These few leaders stand to benefit from recognizing the SDGs as a powerful catalyst for the innovation, partnerships and market transformations that build businesses. They will also be at an advantage when communicating with the many investors, governments and other stakeholders who are taking an increasing interest in the contribution of business to the SDGs.”

Key findings from KPMG’s study include:

The SDGs most commonly prioritized by leading companies are Climate Action (SDG13), Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG8) and Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG3)

The SDGs least commonly prioritized are Life on Land (SDG15), Zero Hunger (SDG2) and Life Below Water (SDG14)

Three quarters (75 percent) of companies that report on the SDGs discuss the impact their business has on the goals, but reporting is largely unbalanced with most companies discussing their positive impacts but not the negative

Four in ten (39 percent) companies that report on the SDGs include the global goals in their CEO and or Chair’s message

The hotel industry and Japanese companies are among the business entities taking action recently.

Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) is advancing inclusive, sustainable economic growth through a partnership approach across governments, business and civil society. P4g has invited concept notes to join its Partnership Fund, which will be accepted through 30 March 2018. The P4G initiative aims to catalyze inclusive, sustainable economic growth through partnerships and solutions in support of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. P4G supports partnerships through funding, facilitation and recognition. P4G partners include the governments of Chile, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Viet Nam, the C40 network of 91 major cities, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Also working in alignment with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) established four ‘ITP Goals,’ addressing climate change, water, youth employment and human rights. The goals “embrace science-based targets” on carbon, and encourage the hotel industry to reduce carbon emissions at scale. According to the UN, the global hotel industry accounts for approximately one percent of global emissions, and this amount is predicted to increase as demand grows. ITP encourages the use of its Hotel Footprinting Tool for hotels to identify their carbon emissions and identify areas of improvement, including through energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.

On water, the ITP goals focus on addressing water scarcity and improving water-use efficiency. On youth employment, the ITP goals aim to double the industry’s impact on youth unemployment through employability programmes. On human rights, the ITP goals seek to raise awareness of human rights risks, address risks in the labor supply chain and hotel construction, and include human rights in corporate governance.

The Japanese company Omron considers the SDGs in developing medium-term business plans.

In Japan, companies have set targets in line with the SDGs and are working to advance sustainability across a number of the Global Goals. Companies that have set SDG targets include:

Ajinomoto, which works on infant nutrition in developing countries;

Fujitsu, which advances environmental technologies;

Lixil, which will increase the number of developing countries in which it manufactures portable toilets;

In a blog post, UNDP Indonesia shares nine characteristics that are key to its Country Platform’s potential success.

The UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 envisions the role of Country Support Platforms as helping countries design and deliver integrated SDG solutions, with variation among platforms according to the country context. The platforms respond to increased demand for collaboration among a wider range of actors.

UNDP Indonesia presents the SDGs as “the trillion-dollar investment opportunity that they are” rather than focusing on potential funding shortfalls. According to UNDP Indonesia, 79% of Indonesians donated money in the past month, making Indonesia the second most generous country in the world. Islamic law mandates that all Muslims who are eligible donate at least 2.5% of their income or accumulated wealth to the poor and needy, a practice known as Zakat. UNDP Indonesia calculated that, if every eligible Muslim pays US$74 annually, the country could generate US$16 billion, an amount that “represents a huge potential to support the SDGs.”

The nine key characteristics of Indonesia’s Country Platform are:

A collaborative space: The Platform involves the UN, the Government of Indonesia, private sector and civil society, both in Indonesia and globally, in developing solutions to achieve the SDGs;

Focus on partnerships: UNDP Indonesia has invited a wide range of actors to participate in the Platform, including to set the agenda, provide funding, second staff and become investment partners;

Pilot and scale innovation: The Platform has tested new solutions with the aim of replicating solutions within and across countries and advises large-scale investments on inclusivity and sustainability;

A networked Platform: The Platform is composed of a horizontal network of platforms that are linked with other countries to facilitate South-South cooperation;

Focus on SDG financing: The Platform is focused on designing financing instruments, informing investments and developing and advising partners on policy and knowledge sharing, an approach aimed at responding to demand and producing results;

Maximum innovation: The Platform has “one foot inside and one foot outside the government,” a position that allows the Platform freedom to innovate and leverage change;

Capacity-building: The Platform utilizes skills like Islamic finance and private investment, SDG impact measurement, systems thinking and design and technological solutions;

Sustainable: The Platform’s business model relies on a combination of grants and service fees, with the aim of increasing fees over time; and

Integrated: UNDP serves as an integrator in the Platform by facilitating a system-wide approach to the SDGs, bringing together partners and providing a space for innovation.

The partnership between BAZNAS, the state zakat agency, and UNDP Indonesia is the first time a Zakat organization has committed to supporting the SDGs. Zainulbahar Noor, BAZNAS, said that the agency’s conversations with UNDP helped BAZNAS to realize that “when you are talking about SDGs, you are talking about zakat.” Noor said UNDP and BAZNAS are collaborating on zakat inclusion, explaining that when the agency collects zakat through branchless banking, it can use the funds to support the SDGs.

In emissions trading scheme (ETS) news, the US state of New Jersey is rejoining a regional greenhouse gas (GHG) initiative after six years, and Kazakhstan launched its reformed ETS.

In January 2018, Canada began the implementation of its national carbon pricing strategy, announced in 2016. The carbon pricing scheme is part of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which aims to reduce emissions and build climate resilience while ensuring economic growth. Canada has set a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Under the national scheme, Canada’s provinces and territories can choose their approach to carbon pricing using either an explicit price or a cap-and-trade scheme. In 2019, the Canadian government will implement a federal-level pricing backstop that will apply to provinces and territories that either request this or that do not have an adequate pricing system in place. A draft legislative proposal for this federal backstop will be made available for comment in early 2018. In a comment, environmental advocacy group Carbon Market Watch noted that the Canadian federal government must negotiate with ten provinces, suggesting that this means on the one hand that the new plan is likely to force provinces to do more to reduce emissions. On the other hand, the flexibility and autonomy allowed in implementation “could undermine its performance.” [Government of Canada Webpage on Carbon Pricing] [Carbon Market Watch Commentary]

In ETS news, the US state of New Jersey is on track to rejoin the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) of nine states after incoming state Governor Philip D. Murphy (Democrat), elected in November 2017, signed an executive order that initiates a rule making process for re-entry. New Jersey, a founding member of the RGGI, left the initiative in 2012 under Governor Chris Christie (Republican). The International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) reported that New Jersey’s power sector emissions increased by 15% between 2011 and 2015 while those in the other RGGI states decreased. [ICAP Story]

After two years in suspension, Kazakhstan relaunched its ETS on 1 January 2018. The revamped ETS includes new provisions and targets, including a three-year national allocation plan and an emissions cap of 5% below 1990 levels by 2020. The Kazakh ETS now comprises 225 installations and 130 companies in the energy and industrial sectors. To support the relaunched ETS, Kazakhstan has also developed, jointly with the World Bank, an electronic reporting system for GHG emissions from these sectors. [ICAP Story] [ICAP Kazakhstan ETS Infosheet] [World Bank Press Release]

In an effort to safeguard the environmental integrity of The EU ETS ahead of the Brexit, the UK informed the EU Climate Change Committee that it adopted a law on 27 December 2017 that advances its compliance deadline for 2018 emissions to a date preceding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Consequently, and in line with an EU ETS Registry Regulation endorsed by the Climate Change Committee in November 2017, allowances issued by the UK during 2018 will not be marked or accepted for surrender.

Danish energy giant Ørsted's chief executive has highlighted the severe threats of climate change and the unique opportunities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the company's latest sustainability report, which outlined the company's transition away from fossil fuels.

Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy, released its first sustainability report since the name change, earlier this week. The report outlines that over the past decade, the Danish company had reduced its coal use by 82% - with a 100% reduction targeted for 2023 – while sourcing 64% of heat and power generation from renewables – with a target to source more than 95% in place for 2023.

As part of his speech to accompany the report, Ørsted’s chief executive Henrik Poulsen noted the need to transition to clean energy sources, a claim backed by the 23 offshore windfarms currently owned by the company.

""The world is in the middle of a global climate crisis. It is not a distant threat,” Poulsen said. “The planet is already feeling the grave impact of climate change. And truth be told, we are still not doing enough to secure the planet for generations to come. We need to transform the global energy systems from black to green energy at a high pace.

“Ørsted’s vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. It is deeply rooted in what we do and who we are as a company. We want to be a company that provides real, tangible solutions to one of the world’s most difficult and urgent problems.”

The company has a 2023 goal to reduce carbon emissions by 96% against a 2006 baseline and use 100% certified sustainable biomass for CHP plants by 2020. The latest report notes that Ørsted has reduced emissions by 67% since 2006, and currently sources 72% certified biomass.

For emissions, Ørsted noted that its science-based reduction target is not only in line with the Paris Agreement, but is actually 27 years ahead of the reduction trajectory for the sector.

The goals are all aligned to the United Nation’s SDGs, with an emphasis on goal 7 (clean and affordable energy) and goal 13 (climate action).

“At Ørsted, we are committed to running our business in a way that creates progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,” Poulsen added. “The 17 goals express a global agreement of society’s greatest challenges towards 2030. We especially focus on goal no. 7 on clean and affordable energy and goal no. 13 on climate action.”

Last year, Ørsted completely divested its upstream oil and gas business, as part of the pledge to phase-out coal from its heat and power generation by 2023. The company is also relaying this transition onto customers.

The firm announced that it will offer UK businesses the chance to purchase renewable electricity at a subsidised rate, by absorbing cost premiums to ensure that green energy prices are no higher than traditional ""brown energy"" sources.

Hornsea One

Ørsted’s sustainability report was published on the same week that the company began construction on the world's biggest wind farm; the Hornsea One project off the Yorkshire coast. By 2020, the 1.2GW project is expected to deliver enough electricity to power more than one million homes.

The project will also be followed by the bigger Hornsea Two wind farm. The 1.3GW wind farm was granted a final investment decision last September.

Consisting of 11 Heads of State and Government and one Special Adviser, the Panel focused on accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), as well as on the other SDGs that rely on the development and management of water resources, especially SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 3 (good health and well-being); SDG 15 (life on land); SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 1 (no poverty); and SDG 13 (climate action).

In April 2016, the UN Secretary-General and the World Bank President convened the HLPW to champion a comprehensive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources, as well as improving water and sanitation-related services. The Panel presented its outcome package, titled ‘Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action,’ to the UN Secretary-General on 14 March 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The package consists of an open letter to fellow leaders, an outcome document, short summaries of key initiatives undertaken by the Panel, and a galvanizing video.

Through the package, the HLPW advocates for evidence-based policies and innovative approaches at the global, national and local levels to make water management and water and sanitation services attractive for investment and more disaster-resilient. It also calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome package calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome document presents a summary of the Panel’s findings and recommendations. The text notes that action on SDG 6 is urgent, explaining that gaps in access to water supply and sanitation, growing populations, more water-intensive patterns of growth, increasing rainfall variability, and pollution are combining to make water one of the greatest risks to economic progress, poverty eradication, and sustainable development. The document underscores that if the world continues on its current path, it may face a 40% shortfall in water availability by 2030, with consequences that will be disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable. Within this scenario: approximately 700 million people are at risk of being displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030; more than two billion people are compelled to drink unsafe water; and more than 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services.

The Panel stresses the need to invest in data for water management and to strengthen water governance mechanisms. It further calls for: an integrated approach to water management; investing more efficiently in disaster risk reduction and in water-related infrastructure; building sustainable cities and human settlements; and strengthening global and international water cooperation. The HLPW also recommends encouraging innovation, promoting partnerships, and increasing finance and institutional support for water issues. Other recommendations include ensuring universal access to safe water and sanitation, and nurturing environmental water.

The Open Letter highlights that the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development,” will commence on 22 March 2018, and the Heads of State and Government on the Panel ask readers to join with them in “committing to valuing water and taking action to address our water challenge within this decade.” [Publication: Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action][HLPW Website][Open Letter to Global Leaders] [ UN Secretary-General Receives HLPW Outcome (Press release)] [HLPW video inspires the world to take action (Video) ]","14 March 2018: The High Level Panel on Water (HLPW) released its outcome package, concluding its mandate with a call for a fundamental shift in the way the world manages water.

As energy is a ‘nexus issue’ that spans the breadth of the SDGs, our attention was also drawn to knowledge products that directly link energy to decent jobs (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

The Global Preparatory Meeting for Review of SDG 7 took place from 21-23 February, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Thai Ministry of Energy. The meeting highlighted progress on energy access in the Asia-Pacific region, but also remaining challenges. In her opening remarks, ESCAP Executive Secretary Shamshad Akhtar noted that the region remains “the most energy intensive” in the world. The SDG Knowledge Hub summary of the meeting is here.

As an input to the assessment of SDG 7, a series of 27 policy briefs was developed by the Ad Hoc Informal Multi-stakeholder Technical Group of Advisors on SDG 7. Each brief features key messages and statistics on progress so far, as well as priority actions to accelerate movement towards the Goal. The briefs are categorized into four sections: 1) advancing SDG 7 implementation; 2) interlinkages between SDG 7 and other Goals; 3) regional perspectives; and 4) “toward a sustainable and equitable energy future.”

Under the first heading, the papers look at trends in achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix, financing SDG 7 and more. The brief on electricity access notes the difference between having a source of electricity and having universal access, cautioning that the former does not guarantee the latter. The brief on cooking fuels highlights that 40% of households (3 billion people) still prepare meals using “traditional” stoves, which poses a risk to both human health and the environment. It notes that upwards of 4.3 million deaths each year are attributable to household air pollution, and lists priority actions for policy, planning, finance and monitoring, such that clean cooking fuels can be realized for all. The brief on increasing the share renewables notes that 80% of total final energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, but that 60% could of electricity be generated by renewables by 2030. The finance brief highlights the importance of policy measures on both the demand-side (i.e. de-risking investment, carbon pricing) and supply-side (financial system reform). It also outlines the potential for financial technology (“fintech”) solutions to facilitate the development of small-scale, distributed energy systems.

A brief linking energy, climate and transport calls for prioritizing alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

Ten policy briefs highlight linkages between SDG 7 and other Goals. The brief linking energy to poverty and inequality highlights that “energy is a precondition for economic development,” meaning that achieving SDG 7 is not only a goal in itself, but also a means of achieving others. The water-energy-food nexus brief notes that policy coherence is key to managing tradeoffs and synergies, given increasing needs across all three areas. Connecting energy to health, Policy Brief #10 recalls the above statistic on clean cooking fuels, also describing how energy enables health services (i.e. through vaccine refrigeration and equipment sterilization) and offering examples of how SDG 7 contributes to targets under SDG 3. The briefs linking energy to climate and transport call for prioritizing reduced emissions and alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

The ‘Regional Perspective’ category dedicates papers to energy trends in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Arab region, as well as a brief covering Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The fourth category unpacks long-term and systemic issues, such as energy pathways to 2050 and the linkages between indicators, data and energy. The papers were developed in conjunction with stakeholders from the UN system, bilateral governments, multilateral actors and civil society.

During the meeting, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Southeast Asia.’ The report describes macroeconomic and social trends, analyzes the current energy landscape and recent investment and deployment trends, and outlines the benefits of decentralized renewable energy. It finds that, although 65 million people in the region currently lack reliable electricity access, there remains potential to tap significant renewable energy resources whilst adding jobs in the energy sector. The report makes a case for diversifying energy production through renewables, noting that there were over 611,000 renewable energy jobs in the region as of 2016. The report also highlights socio-economic, health and environmental benefits from decentralized renewable energy, offering a goal-level mapping to the SDGs starting on page 131.

As previewed in last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Region convened from 1-2 March in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum discussed Goal 7 among the other SDGs to be reviewed at the HLPF. Case studies of national experiences in implementing the Goals in ECE countries were provided by governments and other stakeholders for discussion at the meeting. They examine how energy systems are being made more efficient, what initiatives have enabled increased investment, and the policies and measures that have been implemented to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.” A session on ‘transforming energy in support of the 2030 Agenda’ explored the reconciliation of countries’ emissions targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change with their short-term reliance on fossil fuels.

Additional knowledge products were released outside of the meetings. A separate report by IRENA finds that, despite the EU’s current reliance on fossil fuels, member countries “could cost effectively double the share of renewable energy by 2030.” The finding, one of many from ‘Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union,’ comes as part of a broader, bottom-up REmap analysis that assesses and aggregates countries’ and regions’ renewable energy potential. REmap’s aim is to build a roadmap that looks not only on technologies for electricity, but also for heating, cooling and transportation

A joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) and Facebook looks at options for bridging the “digital divide,” noting that nearly 4 billion people lack internet access. Titled ‘Powering Last-Mile Connectivity,’ the paper frames the issues partly as one of a need for better infrastructure to increase efficiency. The paper cites that mobile network operators spend up to US$3.8 billion on fuel alone to power infrastructure, and that for consumers, charging mobile phones is both costly and time-consuming if charging points are far away, as is often the case in rural areas. The findings highlight the importance of the interlinkages across the SDGs, particularly the interface between SDG 7 and SDG 9,

The Center for Global Development released a policy paper titled, ‘What Can We Learn about Energy Access and Demand from Mobile-Phone Surveys? Nine Findings from Twelve African Countries.’ While not explicitly covering SDG 7, the paper offers insight as to both survey techniques and challenges facing universal access to energy services (SDG target 7.1).

At the city level, new analyses by CDP find that 102 cities worldwide now source at least 70% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Detailed coverage of the CDP report, and related energy news from the BP, Coal India, and the Government of Ireland, is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

A recent audit of land ownership by the Kenya Land Alliance that was guided by gender parity objectives set out in Kenya’s constitution, the SDGs and various African Union (AU) targets, including the AU Declaration of Land Issues and Challenges in Africa and related target of achieving 30% of documented land rights for women by 2025, found that despite the adoption of Kenya’s progressive new constitution in 2010, women’s land ownership lags far behind that of men. The audit analyzed about one-third of the 3.2 million title deeds issued since 2013 and found that women hold roughly 10% of land titles issued in the last five years. An even greater gender disparity was found in terms of actual land size, with women getting only 1.62% of more than 10 million hectares of land titled during this period.

Discussing the need to build the evidence base on how best to strengthen women’s land rights in Africa and globally, a post on the World Bank’s Voices blog makes a case for more “nuanced data collection.” The blog references a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), titled, ‘Women’s land rights as a pathway to poverty reduction: A framework and review of available evidence,’ which argues that despite the large body of literature on the relationship between land tenure security, livelihoods, and poverty, most of this literature is based on household-level data and does not consider possible intra-household inequalities in land ownership. It mentions ongoing efforts at the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) to develop standard methods for measuring perceived tenure security, for example on the differing perceptions of women and men about their risk of land confiscation, or the experiences of women within male-headed households. Among some examples of possible policy measures that build on a more “nuanced” approach to land data, the blog highlights efforts to incentivize joint registration of land held by married couples in Uganda, and a project in Benin to demarcate village boundaries and certify farm plots.

Another UN-HABITAT report published on the Land Portal titled, ‘Women and Land in the Muslim World: Pathways to increase access to land for the realization of development, peace and human rights,’ notes that while women around the world face similar challenges – including socially prescribed gender roles, unequal power dynamics, discriminatory family practices, and unequal access to justice – the influence of customary and religious practices in countries with a dominant Muslim population create “context-specific opportunities to meet these challenges.” Among some tenure options in these contexts, the report pays special attention to the protection of women’s land rights through inheritance and at the time of marriage, when the land and property regime of the family is redefined. Legal and administrative reforms, access to justice, credit and microfinance are presented as important conditions for change, with emphasis on the protection of displaced women’s land and housing rights.

One example of how programmes are working in an innovative way in a Muslim setting is the use of community radio to raise women’s awareness of their land and property rights in the predominantly Somali-speaking Garissa County of northern Kenya. An article published on the Land Portal narrates an exchange among women members of a radio listening club following the airing of a specially-packaged radio programme, which includes drama series, radio features, call-in sessions and a segment explaining relevant clauses within the Kenyan constitution.

Some listeners recount how they lost everything after undergoing divorce, while others highlight the struggles they have gone through to get ownership of their land, livestock and property, and the abuse they have received as a result. The article notes that as a result of the awareness created, mass applications received by the Garissa land registry office from women wanting to transfer land into their names. The overall impact on women’s economic empowerment is further highlighted by the success of the Sankuri Women Milk Hawking Cooperative Society, which was established in 2011 by activists, divorcees, widows and other village women who had faced cultural injustices. The article highlights the change in women’s social status, with one woman joking that men now inquire if women are divorced “so that they can marry us and be part of our prosperity.” [Kenya Land Alliance Website] [World Bank Voices Blog Post on Women’s Land Rights] [Publication: Women’s Land Rights as a Pathway to Poverty Reduction: A Framework and Review of Available Evidence] [Publication: Women and Land in the Muslim World] [Land Portal Story on “Land Rights FM”] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on International Women’s Day 2018]","Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

Over the last thirty years, the number of lives lost from severe weather events has decreased largely because of increased accuracy of weather forecasting and warnings, and improved coordination with disaster management authorities.

Issued on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2018, the report titled, ‘Multi-hazard Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ focuses on the need for community engagement and education, disaster preparedness and effective dissemination of warnings, all required for effective early warning. It incorporates the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems, disaster risk information and enhanced risk assessments.

Early warning is reflected in the SDGs, particularly those related to food security, healthy lives, resilient cities, environmental management and climate change adaptation.

The checklist provides a list of actions that national governments, community organizations and partners can refer to when developing or evaluating early warning systems based on four main elements: disaster risk knowledge; detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards and possible consequences; warning dissemination and communication; and preparedness and response capabilities. The document will be updated based on the development of technologies, advances in multi-hazard early warning systems and feedback from the users.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRR Mami Mizutori urged countries to incorporate the checklist into national and local DRR strategies, which are scheduled to be in place by 2020 in accordance with target (e) of the Sendai Framework for DRR (substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2020). She said that a multi-hazard approach to early warnings is critical for building disaster resilience. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said WMO is working to establish a global standardized multi-hazard alert system in collaboration with National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS).

Early warning is an important component of a number of international agreements. The Sendai Framework for DRR recognizes the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems. The SDGs address early warning, particularly those related to food security (SDG 2), healthy lives (SDG 3), resilient cities (SDG 11) and climate change adaptation (SDG 13). The Paris Agreement on climate change also mentions early warning systems as a focus area to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, reduce vulnerability, and minimize loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.

An outcome of the first Multi-hazard Early Warning Conference that took place in May 2017 in Cancún, Mexico, the checklist updates the original document, ‘Developing Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ which emanated from the Third International Conference on Early Warning in March 2006.

Also in March, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) reported that one in five children globally does not attend school, and that little progress has been made in improving school attendance over the past five years.

The 38-member Steering Committee was established in 2016 as the coordination mechanism for education in the 2030 Agenda. It is comprised of UN Member States, eight UN agencies, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and various international partnerships and organizations. The Committee issued its recommendations as it met for the fourth time from 28 February-2 March 2018, at the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Headquarters in Paris, France.

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay stressed that the commitments expressed in SDG 4 are ambitious, and that building education systems is a collective responsibility that can be achieved through cooperation among all stakeholders. Among its recommendations, the Committee calls for US$280 million a year to be invested in data collection, monitoring and reporting. It calls for institutions that have a UN mandate to monitor SDG 4 to be guaranteed financing, based on agreed responsibilities and shared costs. The Committee also encourages governments to develop holistic national evaluation systems, and to take part in regional or international learning assessments.

In handing down its recommendations, the Committee emphasized that education is a human right, and governments have a responsibility to provide it. The Committee endorsed a one-year advocacy campaign on SDG 4, which will be carried out by the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM), UN agencies, regional organizations, countries and civil society networks.

The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards SDG 4 in 2019. Preparatory consultations will take place beforehand in Kenya, Bolivia, Thailand, Tunisia and France in 2018, followed by a Global Education Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, from 3-5 December 2018.

UIS statistics show that 9% of primary school-aged children and 33.3% of secondary school-aged children do not attend school. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in three children overall does not attend school, and girls are more likely to miss out than boys. Among those who do attend school, one in six does not achieve minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics.

UIS is the official data source for monitoring of SDG 4. Silvia Montoya, UIS Director, said UIS is developing further indicators to monitor equitable education and learning outcomes.

Recently announced resources approach transparency and accountability through the lenses of corruption, gender equality, agriculture, and financing for sustainable development. This brief also reviews recent releases on the monitoring and review process for the SDGs.

The SDGs acknowledge that corruption can be a hindrance to sustainable development, with target 16.5 calling for the substantial reduction of the practice, as well as bribery in all forms. Transparency International’s Marie Chene writes on Medium that civil society actors and activists can monitor corruption using alternative indicators and data sources, which also chart corruption’s impacts on SDG achievement. She also highlights the role of civil society actors in increasing accountability through peer reviews of countries’ Voluntary National Review (VNR) reports, which are submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and conducting parallel reviews and shadow reports that complement—and potentially challenge—countries’ official VNRs.

Transparency International released one such country-level “shadow report” for Afghanistan. The report titled, ‘Policy, SDGs and Fighting Corruption for the People: A civil society report on Afghanistan’s Sustainable Development Goals,’ builds on a series of analyses conducted in 2017, which uses a common methodology to examine country progress towards SDG 16. Looking particularly at SDG targets 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows), 16.5 (substantially reduce corruption and bribery) and 16.10 (ensure public access to information), the report outlines how corruption negatively impacts on development through poor service provision and insecurity. It highlights Afghanistan’s progress on these thress targets, such as anti-money laundering efforts and the establishment of institutions to protect against corruption, but flags that, in practice, there is an implementation gap and low inclusion of civil society in anti-corruption legislation. A Transparency International press release is available.

Also on target 16.4, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) announced a new initiative to measure illicit financial flows in Africa during the 49th session of the UN Statistical Commission, which was held from 6-9 March on the theme, ‘Better Data, Better Lives.’ The SDG Knowledge Hub’s story on that session’s discussion of the SDG indicators is here.

Turning to gender and accountability, as covered on the SDG Knowledge Hub, the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation, in partnership with Women Deliver and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), launched the ‘Practice Guide to Auditing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Gender Equality’ on the sidelines of the 62nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 62), which is currently convening in New York. The guide reviews international commitments to gender equality and supports supreme audit institutions (SAIs) by developing an approach to ensure accountability and institutions’ meeting their commitments.

In the boardroom, BlackRock recently sent letters to 367 companies that have fewer than two female board members, asking these companies to justify the gender imbalance, Bloomberg has reported.

At the regional level and on agriculture-related SDGs, a research article in Sustainability informs the development of a “composite baseline index of the agriculture-related SDGs in Southern Africa to guide progress reporting.” The paper summarizes agriculture’s presence across the SDG framework, and uses data for eight indicators under five SDGs (1, 2, 6, 7 and 15) to develop the index for 13 southern African countries for which data on all indicators were available. The authors note that, in the face of data limitations and constraints, the results may be used to ensure accountability in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as a range of national investments and commitments prioritize agricultural developments. Further, the index can be used to track progress towards implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

On monitoring and accountability in the context of the broader 2030 Agenda, the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC) published the collaborative report titled, ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the Voluntary National Review Reports Submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017.’ The report aims to strengthen accountability by highlighting best practices in reporting, as well as gaps (notably around data). Highlights of the paper’s launch event and a detailed summary of the report by contributing author Nathalie Risse are available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A baseline of Australia’s SDG progress has been developed, with a dashboard to track 72 targets and 133 indicators.

The above knowledge products all point to the importance of transparency and data availability. These two pillars have been the focus of Australia’s approach to SDG implementation, as highlighted by Lisa Cornish on Devex. The 2018 Australian SDGs Summit was convened on 13 March 2018, in Melbourne. Previewed during the event, a baseline assessment of Australia’s progress towards the SDGs uses four methods to create a dashboard examining trends for 72 targets and 133 indicators. The document is being developed by the National Sustainable Development Council with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). With robust data and publicized findings, interested stakeholders can track the status of their priority goals, and become increasingly empowered to hold their governments accountable when progress is lacking.

On finance and accountability, Eurodad’s María José Romero writes on UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Hub that public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be less favored than standard public procurement processes if there is increased transparency about their costs. Although PPPs increasingly are used to finance development projects and can enable cross-sector collaboration, the cost of “capital, profit expectations by the private partners and transaction costs associated with the negotiation of complex PPP contracts” can detract from cost efficacy. The blog suggests that PPPs’ accounting practices can create a false narrative in governments’ balance sheets, and calls for increased transparency around PPPs and the disclosure of their long-term fiscal implications.

Per the paper, the ECOSOC review process offers the potential to discuss whether the Council’s current arrangements are sufficient for supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related commitments, and offers the potential to make refinements as needed.

The ECOSOC review was mandated by UNGA resolution 68/1, which calls for government to conduct a review of reforms undertaken to strengthen ECOSOC following an earlier resolution (A/RES/61/16). Alya Ahmed Al Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, serve as co-facilitators for the review process.

Titled ‘Review of General Assembly resolution 68/1,’ the informal background paper outlines “key issues” in the implementation of UNGA resolution 68/1 in the context of the 2030 Agenda. It includes sections on: strengthening ECOSOC’s common vision and strategy; pursuing substantive integration; fostering effective system-wide coherence and coordination; addressing the “development-humanitarian-peacebuilding continuum” and emergencies; bringing global attention to emerging issues; engaging stakeholders; improving working methods; and key questions for further consideration.

Some have criticized the “distinct but closely related” themes of ECOSOC and the HLPF as creating confusion.

According to the paper, some have criticized the current arrangements as creating confusion, especially regarding the “distinct but closely related” themes of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. The paper therefore notes that Member States could further discuss the current approach of selecting and using an annual main theme for ECOSOC and a separate theme for the HLPF sessions held under its auspices. It adds that the work of ECOSOC and HLPF, including agendas and schedules, could be more strongly aligned, and decided upon with sufficient time for planning, coordination and building opportunities for synergy.

On leadership and strategic direction on the 2030 Agenda, the paper notes that Member States could discuss how ECOSOC can improve the impact of its overall policy dialogue and recommendations, through its Ministerial Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the HLPF and High-level Segment, or through the agreed conclusions, decisions and resolutions resulting from the ECOSOC system’s deliberations.

On integration, the paper indicates that there are approximately 30 UN bodies with a direct reporting relationship to ECOSOC, including: eight functional commissions; five regional commissions; three standing committees; one ad hoc body; eight expert bodies; and four related bodies – and discussions could explore ways to more effectively integrate the subsidiary bodies into ECOSOC’s work. The paper also suggests a discussion on the ECOSOC Integration Segment, addressing: whether it could be better timed to more effectively feed into the HLPF and ECOSOC High-level Segment; whether it should mainly discuss areas requiring significantly strengthened integration efforts towards the 2030 Agenda; and ways by which its policy recommendations could better inform discussions at the HLPF and at the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

The paper outlines that changes to the content and structure of the Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS) could be discussed to address its “unfulfilled potential” as an accountability platform for system-wide performance on the 2030 Agenda. This could be achieved, it notes, by holding two OAS sessions per year, including one that could provide policy guidance on system-wide action at all levels, and one that could focus on strengthening the normative-operational linkages across sustainable development, humanitarian assistance and peacebuilding efforts.

On engaging stakeholders, the paper indicates that more than 4,860 NGOs are currently in active consultative status with ECOSOC, and the growing demand for inclusion remains an important aspect of the Council’s work. It suggests to consider the challenge of streamlining the rules and practices of participation of such stakeholders in ECOSOC, its forums and Functional Commissions, noting that currently, the rules and practices “vary greatly.”

The paper also observes that there is scope for further improving ECOSOC system’s working methods to ensure that the sequencing of its sessions will culminate in the global review of the 2030 Agenda at the HLPF and the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

Member States held two informal meetings on the ECOSOC review process, on 6 and 26 February 2018. Per a letter dated 16 February 2018, the co-facilitators intend to prepare a food for thought paper in advance of the next meeting, scheduled to take place on 19 March.

A ceremony marking the agreement was held on the sidelines of the sixth session of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES-6). The Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators was founded at the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 13) in 2016.

The Thematic Assessment on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production, launched in February 2016 at IPBES-4, found that populations of pollinators around the world are in decline. The report aimed to provide policy makers with an independent assessment of the state of knowledge on the status and trends of pollinators as well as the policies and actions available to reverse that trend. The Coalition was founded at CBD 13 to cooperate actively in the promotion of pollinators, with members committing to: develop and implement national pollinator strategies to protect pollinators and their habitats; share experiences and lessons learned; collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders; and conduct research on pollinator conservation.

At IPBES-6, convening in Medellin, Colombia from 17-24 March 2018, Colombia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Ireland joined the Coalition. Current and new members reported on their activities to date:

Denmark reported how awareness on pollinators among decision makers, the scientific community, and the public has increased and noted the importance of bringing policy makers together, creating partnerships, and motivating each other to do more.

Germany reported that the federal government has committed to fight the decline of pollinators comprehensively, including with: a new action programme, science-based insect monitoring; and research on the causes of insect decline.

Colombia presented a proposed national strategy for pollinators, including actions on: knowledge valuation and monitoring; integrated valuation; capacity strengthening; adoptive management; and legislation.

Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed excitement to join the Coalition, and looked forward to sharing his country’s vast knowledge on pollinators.

The Dominican Republic noted the importance of working with the ministry of agriculture to encourage the use and protection of the domestic pollinator population.

Mexico and Ireland stressed the importance of awareness raising, outlining several current and planned activities in this regard.

Initiated by the Government of the Netherlands, the Coalition now has 16 members. The initiative is open to any country wishing to collaborate in the promotion of pollinators.

The promotion of pollinators relates to SDG 15 (life on land) as well as to SDG 2 (zero hunger).

The World Water Council and government partners announced the winners of the King Hasan II Great World Water Prize and the 5th Kyoto World Water Grand Prize, while the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) announced the Stockholm Water Prize laureates for 2018.

Bruce Rittmann of Arizona State University, US, and Mark van Loosdrecht of Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, were named 2018 Stockholm Water Prize laureates for their work in pioneering biotechnology-based processes for the treatment of water and wastewater. In their announcement, the SIWI committee noted that the two scientists had revolutionized the treatment of water for safe drinking and had refined the purification of polluted water for release or reuse, all while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment technologies. The treatment processes they developed apply microbiological engineering to extract nutrients and other chemicals from wastewater. The Stockholm Water Prize will be presented to the winners at an award ceremony on 29 August in Stockholm, Sweden, during World Water Week.

On 21 March, the World Water Council and the Government of Morocco announced the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as winner of the King Hasan II Great World Water Prize, for its work on promotion and policy guidance for water security. The prize is awarded at the World Water Forum once every three years to recognize excellence in cooperation and sound management in the development and use of water resources. At the award ceremony during the Eighth World Water Forum in Brasilia, Brazil, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría recalled that he had singled out water use as one of his top three priorities for the OECD 12 years ago. He called on governments to properly value water and factor it into decisions on agriculture and land use, urban development, energy, and adaptation to climate change.

Ministers from OECD countries adopted the Principles on Water Governance at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in June 2015, noting that water crises most often relate to crises of governance rather than to lack of water or technical knowledge. The OECD Council Recommendation on Water was adopted as a policy instrument in 2016. On the day the award was presented, the OECD also launched a report, ‘Implementing the OECD Principles on Water Governance.’ The report takes stock of the use and dissemination of the OECD Water Governance Principles, provides a water governance indicator framework, and describes evolving practices drawn from various countries and contexts.

Prior to these events, on 28 February, the World Water Council (WWC) and the Japan Water Forum announced the winner of the 5th Kyoto World Water Grand Prize. The 2018 winner is the Charité Chrétienne pour Personnes en Détresse (Christian Charity for People in Distress, or CCPD) from Togo. The Kyoto World Water Grand Prize is for grassroots organizations in developing countries that have shown outstanding performance in solving water issues. The CCPD has constructed and refurbished drinking water and sanitation facilities, organized site clean-ups, and run educational campaigns and workshops, leading to a decrease in illness from water-borne diseases in Togo.

48,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/sdg-tracker-tracking-global-progress-towards-the-17-goals/,"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: SDG-Tracker: Tracking Global Progress Towards the 17 Goals,"In 2015 the world set a new sustainable development agenda, with the heads of all UN Member States pledging to achieve 17 goals by 2030: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ranging from eradicating poverty to ensuring clean energy for all and reaching sustainable levels of consumption, 169 targets across these Goals were selected to drive efforts in the 15 years leading to 2030.

The SDGs build on the previous set of development targets—the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—which were adopted for the period 2000-2015. Unlike the MDGs, which were predominantly geared towards progress in so-called developing countries, the SDGs were designed to be globally inclusive. The breadth of the 17 Goals, their 169 targets and 230 indicators mean all countries face a significant challenge (domestically, as well as internationally) in delivering these commitments. This inclusiveness was also intended to extend beyond national-level contributions; the scope of the SDGs means that everyone has a role to play. This extends from policymakers to researchers, teachers, businesses and the general public.

As reported by the OECD, only one in ten Europeans knows of the SDGs, and across a sample of 24 countries, only one in 100 knows them well. If inclusivity and societal contribution are fundamental to the Goals, then we are already falling behind.

Engagement with the SDGs requires us to tell stories; we need interactive and engaging data.

Engagement with the SDGs and their potential requires us to tell stories: the narratives of lives across the world as they are now, and what we aspire for them to be. Beyond that, we need to understand how everyone’s stories weave together to provide a landscape of living conditions across the world. To explore where we are now, and how far we have to go by 2030, we need interactive and engaging data. Metrics must be specific to the SDG indicators, but presented in such a way that everyone can engage.

As an integrated project of Our World in Data, we therefore built an initial prototype of our SDG-Tracker—the first project to track the latest data across all of the 17 SDGs in a user-friendly way. It provides an interactive hub where users can explore and track progress across all of the SDG indicators for which there is data available.

The SDG-Tracker seemed like a crucial and somewhat obvious project to launch. We were therefore surprised to find that no one—including the large institutions heading global efforts such as the UN and World Bank—had done so. There are many resources where users can either download data for specific indicators or explore data for specific goals or targets (for example, FAO, UNESCO, IHME, WHO JMP and IEA), but none that brings together data across all of the 17 Goals in a user-friendly, interactive format. Delivering this functionality was the primary aim of our SDG-Tracker.

At SDG-Tracker.org, users can explore progress on all of the SDG indicators for which data is available (some of the official indicators do not have data available, and highlighting these important gaps is another project we wish to work on) at the global, regional and country levels. Where global maps are provided, clicking on a given country will show you a time-series of how a given metric (for example, childhood stunting) has changed over time. You can also add countries to this chart to compare progress across neighbors, regions and worldwide.

All of the data we use at our tracker is sourced from official, high-quality sources including the UN, World Bank, World Health Organization, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, WHO JMP, UNESCO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), among others. All of our metrics are updated from these sources in real-time; as soon as the latest data is available for a given indicator, it automatically updates on our interface (data releases tend to be on an annual basis). We therefore expect to always have up-to-date resource available to track our progress through to 2030.

All of our data is downloadable, and maps and charts are open-access; everyone is free to use and adapt these resources as they wish. We hope they provide a valuable resource that supports the UN, and the work of the many organizations, researchers, teachers and learners working towards the SDGs. We have already heard from many teachers and organizations who are making use of this new tracker.

Across each of the 17 Goals, we also link back to specific entries or resources at the Our World in Data (OWID) website, where you can find more information and longer-term data on all aspects of development.

To inspire participation and concerted effort towards the SDGs, it is essential that people understand how the world stands today and the progress we must make to achieve our targets. Without accessible data, it is impossible to assess progress towards the SDGs. But the SDG-Tracker, with its interactive and engaging presentation of data, provides a tool to help us achieve this global participation and inclusivity.","In 2015 the world set a new sustainable development agenda, with the heads of all UN Member States pledging to achieve 17 goals by 2030: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The conclusions respond to the session’s priority theme, ‘Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.’

CSW 62 convened from 12-23 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with a focus on ‘Empowering Rural Women and Girls.’ CSW 62 considered the review theme, ‘participation in and access of women to the media, and information and communications technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women.’ Over 4,400 representatives from 170 Member States and more than 600 civil society organizations participated in CSW 62.

On information and communications technology (ICT), representatives of 12 countries shared national progress on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment through ICT. Belgium highlighted women’s underrepresentation in media, stressing that women “practically disappear” from media as they age, and shared tools developed to address this challenge, including awareness-raising campaigns. Denmark called for governments and enterprises to be more proactive in promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Saudi Arabia described initiatives to bridge the digital divide between men and women and urban and rural areas. New Zealand expressed concern about “digital harm,” including cyberbullying.

On land tenure, the Commission held a panel on ‘The role of rural women’s land rights and land tenure security in reaching the SDGs.’ Panelists underscored the importance of extending gender equality to land rights and ownership, saying that unless women have equal access to land, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will “become an impossible vision.” Out of 161 countries surveyed, 37 countries have specific laws that grant men and women equal rights to own, use and control land. Panelists urged advancing women’s land rights as a way to catalyze progress on women’s empowerment, including through better implementation of land laws, collecting data on gender-based rights and tenure security, and leveraging the SDG’s land indicators.

The CSW recognized synergies between the work of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including complementarities in the themes of CSW 62 and the 2018 HLPF with respect to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Commission considered a note by the Secretariat, titled ‘Input to the work of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (E/CN.6/2018/11),’ that summarizes the Commission’s potential contributions to the HLPF. CSW’s Agreed Conclusions will be transmitted to ECOSOC and the HLPF for inclusion in their work.

The CSW Agreed Conclusions recommend specific measures to end poverty and enhance women and girls’ food security and nutrition, access to education, health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, decent work, land and productive assets, and rural infrastructure and technology, such as safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and clean stoves. The Conclusions call for ending all forms of violence and harmful practices that impact women and girls.

Women and girls have clearly stated what they want: the rights to own property, the need for quality infrastructure, and the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.

UN Women’ s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described the Agreed Conclusions as a “vital step forward” for ensuring equality for women and girls in rural areas. She emphasized that women and girls have clearly stated what they want: “from the rights to own property, to the need for quality infrastructure, to the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.” CSW 62 Chair Geraldine Byrne Nason (Ireland) stressed that the Agreed Conclusions affirm the Commission’s commitment to leave no one behind, and provide real outcomes to address the lives of rural women and girls.

In the Conclusions, CSW emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship among the empowerment and women and girls, the realization of their human rights and gender equality and the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To ensure their full implementation, the Commission’s recommendations focus on: strengthening normative and legal frameworks and eliminating laws and policies that discriminate against rural women and girls; implementing economic and social policies for the empowerment of rural women and girls, including by building the resilience of rural women and girls to climate change and environmental degradation such as deforestation, desertification and loss of agricultural biodiversity and systematically measuring and incorporating the value of unpaid work performed by rural women and girls in calculations of gross domestic products (GDP) and formulation of economic and social policies; and strengthening the collective voice, leadership and decision-making of rural women and girls.

The CSW also held sessions on: data collection approaches for measuring progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment; gender-based cyberviolence; cooperation between global and regional mechanisms dealing with violence and discrimination against women; and other topics.

Numerous events took place on the sidelines of CSW 62. Estonia hosted an event on ‘Ending violence against women—opportunities and challenges of ICT.’ Speaking at the event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted how ICT innovations can expand economic pathways and improve service delivery and access. However, she observed, the digital gender divide is widening, and more and better data is necessary to understand “the scope of violence against women and girls facilitated by technology.”

The Women’s Empowerment Principles Forum discussed opportunities for business to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Speakers also shared good practices in implementing the Principles, to which almost 2,000 CEOs globally have committed. Participants highlighted the role of gender equality in achieving all of the SDGs, but underscored that gender inequalities remain pervasive in every dimension of sustainable development. In remarks at this event, Mohammed called for action in four areas: placing gender equality at the center of implementation; closing the financing gap, including by identifying innovative sources of funding; improving monitoring through disaggregated data on gender and strengthened national statistical systems; and strengthening accountability for gender commitments at all levels.

The Forum outlined its commitment to eliminate gender gaps in the workplace in the ‘Call to Action of Chile.’

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Chile organized the Forum in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women. The event, which convened in Santiago, Chile, from 27-28 February 2018, focused on the theme ‘The Future of Work and the 2030 Agenda.’ Over 500 representatives from 39 countries, including more than 50 employers’ organizations and trade unions, attended the event.

The Forum addressed gender gaps in the workplace within the context of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). SDG 5 includes target 5.1, to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, and target 5.5, to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making. SDG target 8.5 aims to, by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value.

Participants shared progress and challenges related to achieving these SDG targets. The Gambia’s Vice President and Minister of Women’s Affairs, Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, reported that empowering women and enabling equal opportunities in the workforce is “a key pillar of our National Development Plan.” Jallow-Tambajang emphasized that businesses, from micro-credit and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, are taking steps to reduce inequalities, boost productivity and improve the Gambia’s economies.

Achieving equality in the labor force will require addressing women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work.

Richard Barathe, UNDP, observed that women’s equality in the labor force could contribute US$28 trillion to the global economy by 2025. But, he noted, this will require efforts to address women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, encourage women’s entry into the workforce and close the gender pay gap.

In the Call to Action of Chile, governments, the private sector and union members commit to “work every day” to promote equality and inclusion and to change working conditions to achieve greater equality between women and men. The signatories call on stakeholders to find innovative ways to apply lessons learned and to share the Forum’s messages on gender equity in their workplace and with other companies.

The Forum also discussed UNDP’s ‘Gender Equality Seal’ programme, which certifies companies that have eliminated pay gaps, increased the number of women in decision-making roles and made progress in ending sexual harassment in the workplace. UNDP supports partners in 17 countries around the world to meet gender equality targets.

The Forum’s website features a catalogue of solutions to accelerate gender equality. Solutions are organized around solutions to: eliminate the gender pay gap; promote labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors; build transformative partnerships; eradicate sexual harassment; promote women in business; foster women in leadership; and promote work-life balance.

On promoting labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors, UNDP describes a project that promoted the integration of women and girls in workplaces in Haryana, India, including a training program for women in the stainless steel sector. As a result, jobs opened in a sector that has not traditionally been an option for women in India. UNDP stresses that programmes focused on women “need not use a welfare approach” but can instead use a gender and development lens to focus on sustainable impact.

The report, global in its focus, underscores the importance of such assessments in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity.

‘Assessing Environmental Impacts: A Global Review of Legislation’ finds a wide range of EIA legal requirements, globally. Some countries have strengthened their regulatory frameworks, but other countries have exhibited a trend of weakening the EIA process. On public participation, the report observes significant global variation in the role of public participation in EIAs. In some countries, requirements for public participation for EIAs have been expanded, particularly during the scoping and review stage. A few countries include specific provisions related to indigenous peoples’ participation in national EIA legislation.

On SEAs, the report observes that uptake and implementation of SEA legal requirements has been slow in many countries, and limited guidance exists on public participation and SEAs, including access to information. The report suggests that one reason for this trend may be that SEA legal approaches do not take into account strategic planning processes. According to the report, at least 40 countries have SEA systems in place, but only some of these countries have formal legal requirements to conduct SEAs.

Other report findings include: a need to improve measurement of ecosystem services, including addressing challenges related to a lack of available, accessible and fit-for-purpose data; and an increased focus on climate change and human health in EIA and SEA legislation. The report recommends application of a “migration hierarchy,” a sequence of actions to anticipate and avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as good practice.

The report features country examples of EIA and SEA arrangements. The examples focus on six steps in the process: screening; scoping and impact analysis; review of the EIA/SEA report; decision-making; follow-up and adaptive management; and public participation. For each step, the report shares examples from countries around the world.

Despite every nation on earth voting to adopt the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals less than three years ago, one early adopter wants more UN support.

“I don’t see a campaign. I see a cacophony of things coming out of the UN,” said Dow Chemical chief sustainability officer Neil Hawkins, an early adopter of the SDGs who implores the UN to use change-management practices to drive rapid action among governments globally.

“I think the UN needs to be in there with them,” said Hawkins of the partnerships between NGOs, government and business necessary to address what he called the “big hairy problems” addressed in the 17 SDGs, adopted by the 193 members of the UN in 2015.

The $20 billion Midland, Michigan, chemicals giant, which became the world’s largest material sciences company after acquiring DuPont, has used the SDGs to drive collaboration on issues impossible to tackle as a single company, said Hawkins, referencing clean water prototypes that need to scale to make significant impact. He made the comments at Globe Forum, a sustainability conference in Vancouver.

Beyond driving partnerships, Dow’s most tangible use of the SDGs involves storytelling, said Hawkins.

“It puts a context around your research programs and your product offerings,” he said, adding that investors, senior leadership, the board of directors and employees are key audiences benefitting from seeing issues like light-weighting of vehicles and food preservation technology through the SDG framework.

For the Vancouver-based mining company Goldcorp, the SDGs allowed EVP Brent Bergeron to ask whether the human aspects of their operations were being considered as much as the environmental. Using the Global Goals as a lens allows the gold producer to emphasize positive impacts to communities where they mine, such as access to employment, upgraded regional infrastructure, and the royalties and taxes paid to municipalities.

With sustainability is now being stressed at all levels of management, including local mine general managers whose bonus compensation is tied to ESG, Goldcorp has benefitted from a faster pace of innovation, including work on mining technology that does not require water, and an all-electric mine that does not rely on diesel engines.

“The pressure to conserve water is going up, not down,” said Bergeron, adding a benefit to the innovation is delivering water savings well ahead of regulators requiring action.

Acting ahead of regulators, with the SDGs as guide, is also being seen in the gaming industry, says Gwen Migita, social impact & inclusion vice president, chief sustainability officer, Caesars Entertainment.

While the Las Vegas-based company has built context-based goals into its business planning for years, including Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, much of the current SDG work involves the social aspects of operating in a region that hosts 40 million tourists annually.

A coalition that includes competitors and nonprofits is tackling human trafficking, homeless youth, healthcare for first-generation immigrants, long-term mental health care and other issues seemingly far afield from running casinos.

“It's not just about doing the right thing,” said Migita, who sees benefits to the business including a better pipeline of recruits to work for Caesars’ 14 brands and 400 operations, some of which are in states far more conservative than Nevada and more likely to enact regulations if industry does not act first.

The first set of reports will be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 17), scheduled for early 2019.

UNCCD Parties adopted the new strategic framework during the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13) in September 2017. Unlike the previous 10-year Strategy where countries primarily reported against a set of “performance” indicators, future reports will highlight countries’ progress and impact in relation to five strategic objectives that seek to: improve the condition of ecosystems and affected populations; mitigate drought; derive global environmental benefits; and mobilize financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention.

In view of weak reporting capacity in some countries, the UNCCD’s PRAIS (Performance Review and Assessment of Implementation System) online platform provides access to partly pre-filled templates containing default data on three biophysical indicators (trends in land cover, trends in land productivity, and trends in carbon stocks above and below ground.) These three indicators were also adopted under the SDG framework for reporting on progress towards target 15.3 on land degradation neutrality (LDN).

Since 2014, the UNCCD Secretariat and Global Mechanism have provided support to more than 100 countries to embark on their LDN target setting processes. This initiative, as well as the launch of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) “enabling funding portfolio,” coordinated by the UN Environment Programme, are expected to lend support to countries in producing standardized and high quality reports. In addition, as part of preparations for CRIC 17, the UNCCD Secretariat and its partners are convening six regional capacity building workshops to explore the status of implementation and various issues linked to monitoring and reporting that will also touch on national and regional synergies with the SDG process.

The Responsible Tax Principles were developed in collaboration with leading companies, civil society organizations, institutional investors and international institutions.

The B Team is a global nonprofit initiative co-founded by Sir Richard Branson, Derek Handley and Jochen Zeitz. It brings together a group of global leaders from business, civil society and government to “catalyze a better way of doing business that prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet.” The Principles delineated in the report titled, ‘A New Bar for Responsible Tax,’ offer a framework of good tax practice, including in the areas of tax management strategy, interactions with authorities, and reporting. The Principles have been endorsed by businesses including Allianz, BHP, A.P. Moller – Maersk, Natura Cosméticos, Repsol, Safaricom, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Unilever and Vodafone Group Plc.

The seven Principles proposed by The B Team are:

Make boards accountable for tax policy; Comply with the tax legislation of the countries in which you operate and pay the right amount of tax at the right time, in the countries where you create value; Be transparent about the entities you own around the world and why; Develop cooperative relationships with tax authorities, based on mutual respect, transparency and trust, including by not bribing or inducing tax officials, government officials or ministers with the aim of obtaining more beneficial outcomes with respect to tax matters; Seek and accept tax incentives only where they are aligned with real business, and in the manner intended, and give governments data on impact “where appropriate”; Engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation and administration; and Provide regular information to stakeholders, including investors, policy makers, employees, civil society and the general public, about your approach to tax and taxes paid.

Welcoming the launch of the Principles, Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International, said they have “raised the bar” on what constitutes responsible corporate tax behavior by setting a new standard for companies that claim to operate ethically. She invited all companies to meet these standards, adding that “truly forward-looking” companies should do even more.

Alex Cobham of Tax Network Justice, however, writes that the Principles “lack any hard criteria against which to evaluate progress.” Given the range of existing standards and proposals that do have such criteria, he writes that this makes the “new bar” proposed by The Responsible Tax Principles a lower bar. For example, on Principle 2, Cobham notes that the agreed G20/ OECD position of aligning declared profits with “real economic activity” rather than with “value creation” represents a clearer equivalent and it is thus stronger. On Principle 7, he suggests that other sets of principles, such as the OECD standard, allows for the comparisons needed to judge progress.

The B Team tax principles were launched ahead of the first global conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which took place on the theme ‘Taxation and the SDGs,’ from 14-16 February 2018. The Platform is a joint initiative by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD, UN and the World Bank Group, and it is designed to foster cooperation and build consensus around responsible tax practice.

The UNFCCC Secretariat issued a compilation of capacity-building activities, and a report on implementation of the framework for capacity building in developing countries.

Preparations for the Bonn Climate Change Conference, taking place from 30 April to 10 May 2018, are underway. An informal document by the SBSTA Chair titled, ‘Initial draft of the technology framework’ (SBSTA48.Informal.1), seeks to facilitate Parties’ further deliberations on and elaboration of the technology framework. The document outlines the purpose and principles of, and five key themes for, the technology framework: innovation, implementation, enabling environment and capacity building, collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and support.

The draft contextualizes and proposes possible actions for each area of work. For innovation, possible actions could include collaborative research, development and demonstration (RD&D), promotion of enabling policy and finance for innovation, and engagement of private sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs). For implementation, actions could include technology needs assessments (TNAs), addressing barriers to implementation and private sector engagement.

The draft of the technology framework proposes possible actions under five key themes: innovation, implementation, enabling environment and capacity building, collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and support.

For enabling environment and capacity building, actions could include enhancement of public awareness, promotion of an investment-friendly environment, and formulation and analysis of comprehensive information on capacity-building activities in all stages of the technology cycle. For collaboration and stakeholder engagement, the draft proposes engagement with key stakeholders and collaboration with other organizations, institutions and initiatives. Under support, suggested actions include provision of support, and monitoring and provision of information on support. [Initial Draft of Technology Framework]

The compilation of capacity-building activities undertaken by bodies established under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol (FCCC/SBI/2018/3/Add.1), prepared to inform discussions taking place at the seventh meeting of the Durban Forum on Capacity-building and the first meeting of the PCCB, synthesizes information on capacity building contained in reports published by relevant bodies established under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol and by the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and the Adaptation Fund Board from 1 January to 31 December 2017.

In parallel, the Asia-Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics launched the Pacific Strategic Plan for Agricultural and Fisheries Statistics (P-SPAFS). Both data collection mechanisms were announced as the UK published a report calling for improved data collection to support a growing ocean economy.

Ocean+Data aims to support marine spatial planning, environmental impact assessments and ecosystem assessments as well as other data-driven approaches to ocean conservation. It features 183 data sources, including global marine and coastal datasets, regional datasets, databases from scientific sources and other sources of ocean-related data.

P-SPAFS will enhance data comparability across these sectors in Pacific small island developing States (SIDS). A technical working group with representatives from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and statistics from Pacific SIDS, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the Pacific Community (SPC) developed the P-SPAFS.

Calls and efforts for improved ocean-related data and statistics come as the United Kingdom’s Government Office for Science published a report predicting that the value of the ocean economy will double over the next 12 years to US$3 trillion. The report, titled ‘Foresight Future of the Sea,’ cautions that global environmental challenges, such as ocean acidification, marine plastic pollution and over-fishing, threaten this economic value. Within this context, the report also recommends increased data collection as well as the development of autonomous vehicles and international collaboration on ocean science to better understand marine life, reduce pollution, and improve decision-making towards sustainable ocean management.

Footage courtesy of DFAT.

CANBERRA — Water, sanitation, and hygiene is “fundamental” to Australia’s development assistance and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific told Devex.

Her comments at the WASH Futures conference in Brisbane, Australia, came as the Australian government announced an extension of a partnership between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the World Health Organization to deliver safe drinking water through the WHO-DFAT Water Quality Partnership.

“When you look at water, sanitation, and hygiene, they are fundamental to our overseas development assistance,” Fierravanti-Wells said in an interview. “Indeed, they are at the heart of our Sustainable Development Goals. If you do not have water, if you do not have sanitation, and if you do not have hygiene, then that is a catalyst for a whole range of other issues.”

Between 2012 and 2017, DFAT invested 15 million Australian dollars ($11.78 million) to the partnership. It has so far supported 15 countries in the Indo-Pacific region through the development of water safety plans to help identify complete water supply system, including hazards and risks, and ways to manage them safety. Water safety plans have been implemented across 882 water systems in the 15 countries, supporting more than 35 million people.

The new announcement sees the Australian government investing an additional AU$5 million over five years, and narrowing the focus to four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam.

While the financial investment and geographic focus is a reduction in Australia’s previous contribution, the partnership has still been maintained in an era of a reduced Australian aid budget. Here, Devex delves into what makes this program and partnership project a valuable investment to Australia.

Deliverables of the partnership

Previous Australian aid funding to the Water Quality Partnership supported phases two and three. Phases one and two began the process of building plans and momentum for them in countries being supported. Phase three had a strong focus on creating sustainability through capacity building and encouraging strong local ownership with the water safety plans.

The new funding extends the work of phase three — including capacity building — to specifically deliver water safety, good drinking water, and good sanitation services.

A gender focus was also introduced in phase three, which will be expanded upon in line with Australia’s aid priorities. Australia has a target of 80 percent of its aid to have a gender focus and last year they achieved 78 percent.

“Women are at the heart of what we do, and are the heart of what we do in the Pacific, and [it] will be important to see gender and gender issues — women and girls — at the forefront of the work we do with the World Health Organization,” Fierravanti-Wells said.

But Fierravanti-Wells said the ability to make an impact on vulnerable populations is the most important deliverable.

“We have to think about the fact that 1,000 children a day die from preventable diseases caused by lack of clean water and sanitation,” she said. “Two billion people do not have access to clean drinking water. And about 4.5 billion people around the world do not have access to or are affected by lack of proper sanitation services. So therefore what we do in our region, and what we do with the World Health Organization, will feed into these important objectives.”

Building and maintaining partnerships

The notion of partnerships is important in the Australian aid program today, including encouraging partnerships with foreign governments, NGOs, research institutes, and the private sector. And building and maintaining partnerships is important to the Australian government in continuing this partnership, according to Fierravanti-Wells.

The Water Quality Partnership allows Australia to work closely with recipient countries in the region to strengthen partnership and deliver safe drinking water. But it also allows DFAT and WHO to share knowledge and capability — and continue to build and maintain their relationship. Fierravanti-Wells said the partnership is complementary to the work WHO does, allowing DFAT to gain knowledge from them. And Australia can share their expertise in water management, having had to manage water in a dry climate.

But the partnership between DFAT and WHO has had to evolve to make the Water Quality Partnership more effective in its use of funds.

An Australian aid evaluation report released in 2014 identified high administration costs of the program due to dual administration both at WHO headquarters and from the Australian side within a South East Asia program hub. In 2012, program administration accounted for approximately 23 percent of total expenditure.

“The reason these four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam — have been chosen is that there is a particularly strong World Health Organization structure in those countries,” Fierravanti-Wells said

And by building the new phase of the project around countries with a strong WHO presence, duplication in administration is prevented and each partner can focus on their strengths.

The importance of WASH in Australian aid

According to Fierravanti-Wells, WASH programs “wash through” all aspects of Australian aid deliverables, making it essential to their work. She identified humanitarian responses as one of many examples where WASH crossed through other aid priorities as a fundamental area of support — a higher priority than rebuilding.

Beyond the Water Quality Partnership, Fierravanti-Wells sees Australian aid continuing to invest in, develop, and advance new ways of responding to challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene. The WASH Futures conference was a way of advancing this objective, with participants from the Indo-Pacific were financially supported by DFAT to attend and discuss challenges, issues, and solutions for the region in WASH.

“This conference itself having drawn people from so many parts of the Indo-Pacific is about generating those ideas,” Fierravanti-Wells said. “And when you look at the work that is going to be done over the conference, it is a very granular way that we approach these WASH issues — and I have absolutely no doubt there will be some absolutely fantastic ideas that come out of these days which we and our partners in this space will be able to capitalize on.”

“I’m putting it out there that new ideas are always welcome,” she added.","Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific, on gender issues and WASH. Footage courtesy of DFAT.

“I expected more,” muses Mauritius, the Roman prefect of the Mamertine Prison, critically eying the frail, bald-headed, bewhiskered prisoner standing unsteadily before him.

Perhaps Mauritius is looking for some sign of the charisma and commanding presence that would mark a powerful leader of an infamous cult blamed for burning half the city — or possibly something to warrant the rumors of the prisoner’s supernatural powers and otherworldly character.

Either way, Mauritius wouldn’t have been the first to be less than impressed by the unimposing figure cut by Paul of Tarsus. (Per 2 Corinthians 10:10, Paul seems to have had a rap for being less powerful in person than his mighty letters would suggest.)

The year is A.D. 67, about a dozen years into the notorious reign of Nero, widely deemed responsible for the Great Fire of Rome and said to have scapegoated Rome’s Christian community, not just for the fire, but for hatred of humanity.

For this they were tortured and executed in heinous ways, including being nailed to crosses and set ablaze at night. (The depiction of the persecution is drawn from the Roman historian Tacitus; an opening title tacitly supports the late folk etymology of Nero’s human pyrotechnics giving rise to the term “Roman candle.”)

Paul, Apostle of Christ offers a compelling account the last days of St. Paul — played with gravel-voiced authority by James Faulkner (Game of Thrones; X-Men: First Class) — in a dungeon in the Mamertine Prison, facing execution for treason. It’s not the unmade epic about the life of Paul of Tarsus many would like to see, but what it is is worthwhile in its own right.

Writer-director Andrew Hyatt (Full of Grace) interweaves Paul’s story with two secondary story strands, one concerning Rome’s underground Christian community and the other involving the prefect Mauritius (Olivier Martinez) and his family.

Tying the story strands together is Paul’s old traveling companion, Luke the physician (Jim Caviezel). St. Luke slips quietly into Rome to visit Paul in prison and to bring from him some word of encouragement and guidance to the Roman Christians and the larger Christian world, in the process becoming entangled with Mauritius and his family.

The most dramatically and thematically interesting material emerges from the agonized deliberations of the Roman Christians under the de facto leadership of the missionary couple Priscilla and Aquila (Joanne Whalley and John Lynch), who are companions and fellow workers of Paul (mentioned as such several times in the New Testament).

Conflicting impulses divide the community: Should they remain in Rome, as light in the darkness? Should they seek a warmer welcome elsewhere? Or should they join other Romans opposed to Nero and oppose his tyranny by fighting fire with fire?

Even Priscilla and Aquila are split on whether to stay or go; there are no clear answers here. As for the question of fighting, when speaking to the community Luke strenuously repudiates this as contrary to the way and teaching of Christ — but when he talks to Paul about the horrors inflicted on the believers, he finds his conviction wavering. Though decisively rejected, the prospect and the plausibility of violence in the name of Christ is treated with a level of complexity welcome in such a film.

All of this means trouble at work for Mauritius; there’s also trouble at home. His wife, Irenica (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), is anxious about their daughter’s dangerous illness and worried that her husband may have incurred the wrath of the gods through lack of devotion — or deference toward his sectarian prisoner.

The prospect of a brutal but thoughtful pagan official with a seriously ill family member in a film like this raises the distinct possibility of a miraculous cure and a dramatic conversion. In Paul, Apostle of Christ, these possibilities are actually floated onscreen, which again suggests that the filmmakers may be thinking at least somewhat outside the box.

The conversations between Luke and Paul, which eventually lead to the sequel to Luke’s Gospel, the Acts of the Apostles, form the central arc. Paul recounts vignettes from his life to flashbacks of his early religious training and murderous opposition to what he sees as the heresy of Jesus' followers to his shattering Damascus Road encounter with Jesus Christ and his healing encounter with Ananias.

Luke and Paul have a comfortable relationship easing at times into good-natured banter, though it’s clear that Luke regards the “Old Man” with a species of awe, since everything Luke knows of Jesus has been mediated through Paul’s life and preaching.

If anything troubles Paul, it’s the weight of trauma he still carries from his early crimes as a persecutor of the Church. The stoning of Stephen (André Agius), the killing of a Christian child and other enormities weigh on him, heightened by visions in which he sees his victims standing silently as if bearing mute witness against him. The wordless resolution of this theme is perhaps the film’s most memorable and effective stroke.

Hyatt uses impressionistic slow motion for these visionary sequences, blended with flashback memories, breaking up what is otherwise a largely conversational film shot mostly in dimly lit interiors penetrated by atmospheric beams of light. (The most striking lighting effect involves a pagan offering made to a Roman deity — perhaps Asclepius, the god of medicine — represented as a vast disc-shaped visage like Rome’s famous Bocca della Verità, with bright beams blazing from its eyeholes like laser vision, ready to smite unworthy worshippers.)

At times the nonlinear storytelling leads to some ambiguity regarding the timeline. Some viewers might be confused by a reference in a closing scene to Paul’s two years under house arrest (with which the Book of Acts concludes). The reference is to Paul’s first Roman arrest before the Great Fire, a much less serious affair. (What’s especially tricky is that Paul’s surroundings in this scene are consistent with a house arrest, but the lodgings are not his own and two years don’t pass in the last minutes of the film.)

One oddity is the absence, even in dialogue, of other apostles, notably Peter, whose martyrdom in Rome is generally thought to have coincided closely with Paul’s. Presumably Peter would have been imprisoned like Paul or else with the underground Christian community, yet there’s no mention of him.

Hyatt is Catholic, so the silence about Peter in Rome — or even Linus and Clement, among his first successors as bishops of Rome — seems an odd missed opportunity. (On a subtle note, all the Roman Christian men have beards, which suggests that they’re probably mostly Jewish Christians with an occasional Greek like Luke. I would have liked to see a few clean-shaven Latin faces.)

Shot on a budget and a tight schedule in Malta (where Gladiator and Troy, and more recently Risen, were shot), Paul, Apostle of Christ is remarkably authentic-looking. The screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful, with only occasional missteps, ranging from an occasional poorly chosen phrase (like Luke’s “thoughts and prayers”) to a late moment in which a character who has suffered a trauma more dangerous than Paul’s floggings is up and about far too quickly.

Paul, Apostle of Christ is dedicated to all who have been persecuted for their faith. This potentially raises a sticky point.

Jesus warned Christians to expect persecution, and from his own crucifixion until today the Church has never been without opposition. Today, in fact, Christians around the world are being persecuted as never before. Yet at times the memory or idea of persecution has outstripped the reality.

After the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, Christians often looked back on the early centuries of the Church as a period of constant, ferocious persecution by one Roman emperor after another. In reality, with notable exceptions (including the persecutions of Nero and especially Diocletian), persecution was generally sporadic, haphazard and not state-sponsored. (Some skeptical historians have even questioned the Neronian persecution, though its historicity is accepted by most scholars.)

In our day, global persecution notwithstanding, American Christians are generally far less aggrieved than many of us are inclined to think. It’s easy to imagine many comfortable viewers watching Paul, Apostle of Christ as if it were not only a story of our heritage, and one that resonates with the experiences of suffering souls around the world, but a mirror of our own experience.

On the other hand, the film’s clear repudiation of violence in the name of Christ, its repudiation of efforts to seize the reins of power by any means necessary, and its theme of seeing enemies as human beings are especially welcome today. Sometimes in the effort to resist evil one risks becoming what one opposes, or worse. Paul, Apostle of Christ suggests that it’s always better to suffer evil than to be brought to its level in resisting it.

61,https://www.morrisburgleader.ca/2018/03/08/sdg-getting-ready-to-roll-out-new-community-improvement-plan-fund/,"Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Morrisburg Leader,SDG getting ready to roll out new Community Improvement Plan fund,"MORRISBURG – As a lead up to the pending roll out of its Community Improvement Plan funding opportunity, the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry hosted a series of six consultation sessions that wrapped up here in Morrisburg March 8th.

About 20 people consisting of SDG and South Dundas officials, council and a handful of business and business organization representatives attended the breakfast meeting at the McIntosh Inn.

Tim Simpson, SDG chief administrative officer, who led all of the meetings, said that each attracted a similar-sized crowd.

The counties presented the details of its Community Improvement Plan that will have $100,000 available to area commercial, industrial and institutional property improvement projects later this year.

The purpose of the consultation sessions was to get feedback on the counties CIP plan proposal which is intended to foster regional/local economic development.

The SDG CIP money will only be available in municipalities that have their own Community Improvement Plans in place.

While South Dundas does not yet have its own CIP in place, staff is working towards one, with the aim to roll out its plan about the same time that the counties launches its program.

Simpson describes the Counties CIP as a framework that can be dropped into local CIPs to make funds available to stimulate economic development and community revitalization through financial incentive.

SDG’s CIP strategy is to support regional economic development through proposed funding streams which include: agriculture value-added and facility improvement projects; brownfield redevelopment; re-purposing commercial, institutional and industrial buildings; and, development of roofed accommodations within the rural areas of SDG. Roofed accommodations include bed and breakfasts and are essentially anything that is not a tent or a campsite.

County officials are now in the process of determining eligibility criteria and ironing out the details of the intake process.

The goal is to have the SDG CIP ready for review and council approval by late spring.

Simpson is aiming to keep the application process as simple and seamless and local as possible.

It will likely provide 50 per cent funding grants for selected projects and may even provide interest free loans to successful applicants.

“Our ultimate goal is to have the CIP money available in Summer 2018,” he said.

Simpson acknowledged that the initial $100,000 allocation, “is not a lot,” and that he expects that the demand will far exceed the funds available.

The CIP will be reviewed after a year, and that amount will likely be increased, with council’s approval, in future years.

South Dundas economic development officer Rob Hunter agreed that the $100,00 is likely to be over-subscribed for this year.

“But, just because it’s a small plan, doesn’t mean that it can’t be impactful.”

As an example he pointed to a CIP improvement project in Winchester through which an investment of only $8,000 resulted in a marked improvement to a small business’ curbside appeal. Of that, $4,000 came from the local CIP fund which North Dundas has, matching the owner’s $4,000 investment.

Anyone who was unable to attend this morning’s meeting can find the presentation and a survey on the counties website sdgcounties.ca

‘Faces of the SDGs’ highlights passionate individuals from the produce sector with their own personal Sustainable Development Goal, as part of the Netherlands-based company’s efforts to encourage greater uptake of the SDG challenge throughout the supply chain.

During the Fruit Logistica and Biofach trade fairs in February, Eosta shot the first of a series of portraits of produce professionals with specially-designed SDG cubes; each giving participants the option to choose their preferred goal from a total of 17.

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals framework was adopted by all member countries of the UN, with the aim of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030.

Although former secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged governments to “take the lead with decisive steps,” at the same time he called on businesses to “provide essential solutions and resources that put our world on a more sustainable path”.

Michaël Wilde, sustainability & communications manager at Eosta, said: “We want to take the SDGs out of the theoretical policy space and move them firmly into the commercial environment where economy meets ecology. We hope to create more awareness for these goals both within and outside the produce sector.

“Giving people the possibility to choose their most important goal out of the 17 takes them out of their role as a buyer, farmer or trader,"" he added. ""It creates room for a different kind of conversation about the future of our planet and everyone’s personal role in working towards a cleaner and fairer world.""

Eosta is one of the first companies in the fresh food industry to have actively incorporated SDGs into its current business model. The UN goals have been thoroughly studied and connected to the indicators of the company’s ‘Sustainability Flower,’ an assessment and transparency model developed and used by the company.



The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals form part of the organisation’s sustainable development agenda, with each goal comprising targets to be achieved over a 15-year period.

Goal 12 – ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns – is of particular relevance to the global fresh produce sector. However, Eosta estimates that close to ten further Sustainable Development Goals would be impacted positively if the sector began farm more responsibly.","Eosta, the organic fruit and vegetable marketer and campaigner for fairer practices in agriculture, has announced the launch of the ‘Faces of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’ campaign; an initiative aimed at raising awareness of UN SDGs across the fresh produce sector.

“African countries acknowledge ICT as a pillar for socio-economic growth. And, satellites play a key role in connecting Africa to the rest of the World,” Nyirishema said.

He added, “Definitely, satellite is very important particularly for SDGs, we need to have the means to link various parts of work, to monitor targets, to collect required data from across the continents, analyse it and help to inform policy and regulation and all development interventions.”

Nyirishema was speaking at the opening of a week-long regional workshop on satellite regulations, in Kigali, yesterday.

The workshop, which has attracted delegates from African countries including ICT regulators, and representatives of International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aims at raising awareness about satellite regulatory issues.

“This workshop is very important not just for Rwanda but for the East African region and the continent in general because satellite is a critical and important technology for communications. Africa is a large continent and a very big part of Africa relies on satellite to be connected to the rest of the world, whether it’s for TV, Internet or communication in general,” said Nyirishema.

According to Nyirishema, the cost of launching satellite has gone down in the recent past and what would stop the country from building and launching its first satellite in the orbit is not just the skilled manpower and resources but also other processes including regulatory matters —which are to be partly addressed in this workshop.

“We (Rwanda) are already looking at getting involved with CubeSat and Microsatellites. This is a trend, we have seen some countries do that and we are exploring that, we are taking steps towards that. But that leads to a bigger objective, which we hope that, as continent, we can organise ourselves to launch even bigger satellites and build a knowhow to do that,” he said.

“Africa and Rwanda, to be specific, use satellite. But what we are asking ourselves most is why African counties have not managed to launch satellites.”

“We have realised that all the cost of being able to launch a satellite is going down. It’s not about the knowledge and resources but also it is about the process for the country to be able to successfully launch the satellite.”

Nyirishema added that a time when Africa is trying to claim its position in space, it is good to have ITU experts come here to train African experts to have a complete understanding of what is required to successfully launch a satellite from a process standpoint.

He said, there are a few countries that have already launched their satellites.

“We are looking at getting more countries or regional blocs or the continent working together to also get into the space-faring nations and to build own satellites.”","“African countries acknowledge ICT as a pillar for socio-economic growth.

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The project has reached around 30,000 people.

UNFG also hosts an annual youth event, which focuses on urban agriculture, resilience, community engagement and food security, and aims to ensure that the voices of youth are heard in implementation of the SDGs. In northern summer 2018, UNFG will launch a partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) to showcase equipment used by small-scale farmers in the field, highlighting the importance of technological innovation to promote food security. UNFG also partners with the NYC GreenThumb Programme, Brooklyn Grange, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), among others.

66,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-blockchain-in-practice/,"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Blockchain in Practice,"This week’s brief explores distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, and its potential for contributing to SDG implementation. As touched upon in February through the lens of financial inclusion, the international community is rapidly exploring the technology’s applications to sustainable development challenges.

Distributed ledger technology stores information on a decentralized system, where sealed “blocks” of data are copied and distributed across a network of peers, thus forming a “chain.” Although blockchain has risen in profile in the past several months as the underlying technology to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that uses the platform to enable the transfer of funds on a peer-to-peer basis, this is just one of its potential applications to development.

A white paper from the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development explains the underpinnings of the technology and outlines how it can be used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. The paper titled, ‘The Future is Decentralized: Block chains, distributed ledgers, and the future of sustainable development,’ is the first volume in a series that aims to show how blockchain can be used to build multi-stakeholder, cross-sector partnerships as well as mitigate potential risk. The Commission looks at six areas of application—development aid effectiveness, digital identity, remittances, supply chain management, energy and property rights—and indicates the SDGs to which they apply using the Goals’ icons at the start of each section.

The report’s foreword acknowledges recent political controversies and perceived risks in the technology’s nascent stages, but notes that blockchain should not be seen as a threat to existing governance systems. Some countries have banned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or expressed caution due to perceived risk of its being used for money laundering or financing of illicit activities. The report suggests means of mitigating some of the broad risks, calling for risk management rather than risk avoidance. A press release linked to the white paper describes how the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) are leveraging the platform.

Legislation needs to provide guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.

Delving into additional thematic applications and specific solutions, BlockX Labs’s Laura Marissa Cullell links blockchain case examples to the SDGs in an article on Medium. The post summarizes recent initiatives on SDGs 2, 5, 13, and 16 (on zero hunger, gender equality, climate action and peace, justice and strong institutions, respectively). Programmes implemented by UN-led funds and programs such as the World Food Programme (WFP) yield immediate savings by reducing transaction costs and international bank transfer fees. The DLT-based programmes also enable more transparent finance delivery to specific sites, where, for example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) administers its Green List of Conservation Areas. However, the article also notes challenges for blockchain, reminding readers that it is not a silver bullet: there must be buy-in and support from policymakers, as legislation needs to provide “guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.” Additionally, the lack of adequate infrastructure for high-speed internet access presents a hurdle in some contexts where blockchain applications could provide a solution to development challenges.

Applying blockchain to SDG-advancing projects does not necessarily mean working within (or even with) the UN system. The Plastic Bank, a for-profit social enterprise, seeks to address marine plastic waste in developing countries. The endeavor uses blockchain technology to track recyclable materials and the virtual currency tokens offered to collectors. A Sustainable Brands article featuring co-founder Shaun Frankson outlines his and co-founder David Katz’s business model, which can be scaled to contribute to SDGs 12 and 14 (responsible consumption and production, and life below water, respectively) on a global scale.

Virtual tokens and payments are not only becoming a viable option at the base of economic pyramid. Devex’s Sara Jerving sat down with a USAID consulting firm Konektid International, which is currently experimenting with using cryptocurrency both to receive payments from clients and to pay employees. In the article, Konektid CEO Mike Shanley notes that one reason for the switch is the avoidance of wire fees and the delays often associated with transfers, saying it’s “just a better payment system.”

GreenBiz Editorial Director Heather Clancy explains in a post from February 2018 how the technology can disrupt energy markets, including by advancing streamlined distributed grids. Linking blockchain to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), she writes that units of energy and smart metering appear to be a natural fit with the ledger system, which in turn can help generate verified renewable energy credits (RECs). Clancy also offers an example of how blockchain can increase transparency across products’ supply chains, which serves to accelerate progress on other Goals. She spotlights a Walmart-IBM collaboration kicked off in 2016 to demonstrate how better supply chain information can increase food safety (SDG target 2.1) and reduce food loss and waste (SDG target 12.3). The information gathered on the blockchain enables more strategic removals of tainted or questionable products, avoiding wasteful mass recalls.

In addition to these writings and projects, a number of recent events also examined blockchain’s applications for sustainable development. The Blockchain for Sustainable Solutions Conference took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US, on 2 March 2018. The agenda covered a range of sustainability and development issues that directly map to the SDGs, including climate change (SDG 13), deforestation (SDG 15), energy (SDG 7), water (SDG 6), food (SDG 2), transparency (SDG 16) and finance (SDG 17). A recording of the conference livestream is available on YouTube.

At the Global Festival of Action on Sustainable Development held from 21-23 March, in Bonn, Germany, Tauni Lanier posited that cryptocurrencies and their current popularity could be used to fund SDG projects, particularly in cities. She cited the inherent value of the environment and the transparency gains noted above as selling points for such a currency. An article on Development & Cooperation by Drake Jamali shares remarks from Lanier on new sustainable development financing methods such as diaspora bonds and social impact bonds, in addition to her comments on cryptocurrencies.

Discussions of blockchain’s potential for solving problems facing the international community have appeared in several other news items on the SDG Knowledge Hub in recent months. For further reading, see:

In January 2018, the UNFCCC Secretariat created the Climate Chain Coalition, which uses DLT to strengthen monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of climate actions, as covered by Leila Mead;

In March, a competition was held by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the UN Department of Management’s Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT) to use blockchain to combat child trafficking in Moldova, as covered by Catherine Benson Wahlén; and

Also in March, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted the use of blockchain in nuclear safeguards or machine learning in multilateral disarmament verification, as examples of ways for new technologies to support disarmament and non-proliferation, at a roundtable event in New York, also covered by Leila Mead.

Looking ahead, a workshop on ‘Blockchain for Sustainable and Inclusive Finance’ will take place on 25 April, in Zurich, Switzerland, convened by the Responsible Finance and Investment Foundation (RFI), the Swiss-Arab Network (SAN), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Bank of the Argentine Nation and European Partners for the Environment.

67,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-analyzes-ocean-conference-commitments/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Analyzes Ocean Conference Commitments,"March 2018: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has published a summary and an analysis of the voluntary commitments made in support of the UN Ocean Conference and achievement of SDG 14 on life below water. The commitments covered all SDG 14 targets, with most relating to more than one. The most frequently addressed target was 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). By the text, a majority of the commitments were registered by governments, followed by NGOs and UN entities, with academia, the scientific community and philanthropic organizations registering the fewest commitments.

The high-level event titled, ‘UN Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ (the Ocean Conference), convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from 5-9 June 2017. As part of the outcomes of the Conference, stakeholders registered voluntary commitments for implementation of SDG 14. To date, 1,406 have been logged, and the registration continues. The summary cautions that a number of deliverables pre-date the Ocean Conference, often by many years, indicating ongoing projects.

In analyzing the voluntary commitments geographically, the publication finds that overall, voluntary commitments had good global coverage, spanning most countries and including almost all countries with access to the ocean. They covered all ocean basins, with most commitments relating to the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Regions contributing the largest number of voluntary commitments were Western Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania. The text notes that developed regions with high GDPs made commitments, but many of these focused on activities within their own regions. UN entities provided commitments covering the largest number of countries and global contributions, or contributions not targeting specific countries.

541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion.

The authors mention that using the best, currently available data, a total of 541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with the total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion. In addition, almost all the commitments include in-kind funding as well as staff and technical expertise.

The voluntary commitments will contribute, when achieved, an additional 2.85% to the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs). The increase in protected areas will add to the MPAs present today, covering 6.35% of the ocean. These actions will contribute to the achievement of target 14.5, and, together with the already proposed but unimplemented MPAs (about 1.3% coverage according to the World Database on Protected Areas), will help reach the 10% target, with approximately 10.3% attained by 2020.

The report also offers an analysis of how the voluntary commitments may contribute to the attainment of other SDGs. It shows close linkages between SDG 14 and SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, and SDG 2 on zero hunger. Voluntary commitments on SDG 14 were most often linked (by a count) to SDG 13 on climate action.

The report also reveals a number of gaps. On targets and priority issues within those targets, the publication notes that more attention needs to be paid to both the politically sensitive topic of fisheries subsidies and the issues impacting small scale and artisanal fishers. In addition, answering the many open scientific questions on ocean acidification should also be made an urgent priority. Other issues, such as marine biotechnology and innovative ocean technologies and engineering solutions, such as renewable ocean energy, the text observes, could also benefit from further attention. While there were no glaring geographical gaps, the authors mention that some adjustments might be necessary to ensure that efforts to increase scientific knowledge, capacity building, and technology transfer (target 14.a) focus on those regions and countries that need it most. This is also the case, the text underlines, for capacity building relating to ocean acidification research (target 14.3).

Noting the large number of commitments and the variety of the types of information submitted when registering them, the publication reports that some aspects of successful follow-up should include:

a framework, such a web-based registry, to review commitments and incorporate progress reports to assess individual and collective progress in a public follow-up;

defined methods, data and indicators to support follow-up;

regular reporting by commitment makers in a manner that accounts for diversity between commitments, while including common elements that allow progress to be summarized across targets and SDG 14 as a whole;

Titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste: Hotels,’ the findings have been welcomed by industry and sustainability actors for their potential contribution towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3, which seeks to halve food waste by 2030.

The report was co-authored by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and sustainability organization WRAP, with support from Walmart Foundation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands. Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive of Tesco and Chair of Champions 12.3, which commissioned the study, emphasized the need to take action right across the food chain in order to achieve SDG 12.3. It is estimated that one-third of all food produced in the world is never eaten, with food loss and waste accounting for around US$940 billion in economic losses and eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. At the same time, some 800 million people do not have enough food to eat.

Based on a sample of 42 hotel firms in 15 countries, the study found that the majority were able to achieve a 7:1 return on investment from buying less food and thereby reducing purchase costs, increasing revenue from new menu items developed from leftovers or foods previously considered “scraps,” and lower waste management costs. According to the study report, nearly 90 percent of sites were able to keep their total investment below $20,000, which was less than one percent of sales on average, with more than two-thirds recouping their investment costs within one year.

Yolanda Kakabadse, Board Member of the World Wildlife Fund US, stated that reducing food waste within the hospitality sector provides a unique opportunity not only to influence an industry, but to raise awareness with travelers globally. Marcus Gover, Chief Executive of WRAP, called for a “momentum for change in all hotels,” noting the study had clearly demonstrated that with simple measures, hotels can save money, protect the environment and still satisfy the needs of their customers.

The report outlines five actions for hotel owners and managers: measure the amount of food being wasted to know where to prioritize efforts; engage staff; re-think the buffet; reduce overproduction; and re-purpose excess food. It further proposes that by working together, businesses may also be able to share new best practices to make an even greater impact.

The report follows a 2017 study titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste,’ and is the first in a series of papers examining the business case for specific industry sectors. Analyses of the catering and restaurant industries are expected to be released in 2018.

The white paper explores the successful use of blockchain in bringing new levels of efficiency and effectiveness to the fields of development aid, supply chain management, renewable energy and economic growth.

The Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development was established in September 2017 to develop a multi-sectoral framework to support the UN system, along with Member States, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector and civil society in utilizing blockchain-based technologies to develop local, national and global solutions to urgent challenges.

Launched on 2 March 2018, the publication titled, ‘The Future is Decentralised: Block Chains, Distributed Ledgers and the Future of Sustainable Development,’ aims to demystify block chain technology and demonstrate real-world applicability of its potential, using case studies and field work. The paper is designed as the first volume in a series of primers to provide policy makers, regulators, and UN Member States a non-technical introduction to block chain technology.

The paper calls for using the principles of “do no harm” and “design with not for” when using block chain technology.

The text also looks at the risks posed by this nascent technology, providing suggestions on managing them. The publication identifies several factors that may temper block chain adoption, including:

Telecom infrastructure: Every country must have a certain quality level of information and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate the reach of block chain technology;

Legislative barriers: There needs to be consideration of each country’s legislation and how block chain technology intertwines with it;

Data integrity: Data security protocols and procedures must be in place;

Project management: Agile management, randomized control trials to measure progress and impact, and informed iterations of the actual product itself are needed;

Barriers to communication and education: Customers must be educated about what the technology does, what its advantages are and how to use it; and

Inadequate institutional capacity: Relevant institutions require an appropriate operational capacity in terms of staff, finance, procurement, and logistical resources, as well as the requisite technical ability.

The white paper identifies several principles that should be respected when designing and using block chain technology, including “Do no harm” (stressing that ethical concerns surrounding privacy and the rights of the individual ought to be at the forefront of considerations) and “Design ‘with’ not ‘for’” (conveying that the role of the individual should inform the design of any block chain initiative).

Volume 2 in the primer series is expected to address six additional development areas and feature case studies. It will be released in mid-2018.

70,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/shell-sky-scenario-outlines-pathway-to-well-below-2c/,"Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Shell Sky Scenario Outlines Pathway to Well Below 2°C,"27 March 2018: Shell has issued a report titled, ‘Sky: Meeting the Goals of the Paris Agreement.’ The report introduces a scenario that aims to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C through a combination of “mutually reinforcing drivers being rapidly accelerated by society, markets and governments.”

The scenario recognizes that extending current efforts, such as efficiency mandates, carbon taxes or renewable energy support, is insufficient. It argues that concurrent climate policy actions, and the deployment of disruptive new technologies in government policy environments to incentivize investment and innovation will be required.

In 2013, Shell published its New Lens Scenarios focused on mountains and oceans, which, for the first time, featured scenarios with energy-system modeling to 2100, enabling the viewing of long-term transitions in their entirety. These scenarios showed that the application of CO2-targeted policy frameworks would lead to net-zero emissions in the energy system by the end of the century. However, because this falls short of the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sky Scenario looks at a possible decarbonization pathway of achieving net-zero emissions from energy use by 2070.

Under the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040.

The scenario begins with the current structure of economic sectors and government policies, and assumes “very aggressive, but plausible,” ratcheting up of policy commitments through the first two global stocktakes (GSTs) under the Paris Agreement. It notes that, following the GSTs, greater uncertainties regarding policy implementation and technology development exist, which is why the scenario aims to be both ambitious and realistic by adopting an approach grounded in the energy system’s current reality combined with the long-term temperature goal.

In the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040. Liquid hydrocarbon fuel consumption would decrease by 50% between 2020 and 2050, and fall by 90% by 2070. The scenario also includes sector transformations in transport, buildings, industry, electricity and energy.

The Sky Scenario is based on the following assumptions from now to 2070:

a change in consumer mindset where people preferentially choose low-carbon, high-efficiency options to meet their energy service needs;

a step-change in energy efficiency;

carbon-pricing mechanisms adopted during the 2020s, leading to a CO2 cost embedded in consumer goods and services;

the electrification rate of final energy more than triples, with global electricity generation nearly five times the current level;

new energy sources grow by a multiple of fifty, with primary energy from renewables surpassing fossil fuels in the 2050s;

10,000 large carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are built, compared to fewer than 50 in operation in 2020; and

net-zero deforestation is achieved, and an area the size of Brazil is reforested offering the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Shell has also published quantitative data sets for the Sky Scenario for public use.

Shell is one of the world’s largest publicly traded oil companies, and produces approximately 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This summary provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received from Parties regarding the three questions.

Inputs that were submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Party submissions thus far include those from Australia, China, Ethiopia, the EU, Fiji, Indonesia, Norway, Palestine, Saint Lucia for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group. Input has also been provided by Switzerland, Costa Rica, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden, supported by Monaco.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), many of the submissions concede that current emission trajectories and policies are at odds with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The CARICOM submission reiterates support for the global average temperature rise to remain below 1.5°C, given that climate change impacts are already being experienced in the region with lower warming levels. It laments that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not yet on a pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The submission states that CARICOM countries’ economic and physical survival is already being threatened, and their adaptive capacity challenged or potentially exceeded. It warns that the observed temperature change in the region is greater than the global average stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea level has risen by around 20 centimeters over the past 100 years, and heat waves are already impacting ecosystems. [Report of CARICOM Workshop on IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C and Talanoa Dialogue] [Caribbean Marine Climate Change Report Card 2017] [US Global Change Research Program’s Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary]

China’s submission underscores that efforts to address climate change are inadequate, and notes “huge gaps” in pre-2020 mitigation ambition and action. It indicates that: developing countries are still facing financial difficulties and barriers in delivering climate actions; greenhouse gases (GHGs) are still rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere; and good practices and opportunities regarding mitigation, adaptation and international cooperation have been identified through through the Technical Examination Process on mitigation (TEP-M) and adaptation (TEP-A).

Fiji’s submission discusses, inter alia: political will and effective policymaking, including the Fijian Government’s introduction of innovative green fiscal measures to stimulate investments and economic growth in a range of sectors; successful mitigation initiatives, including solar home systems, a renewable energy revolving fund and solar islands; and Fiji’s progress on adaptation in the housing, transport, agriculture, energy, health and education sectors.

The Arab Group’s submission laments inadequate funding flows to developing countries, including for the transition to more climate-friendly technologies. It states that a carbon market with carbon pricing should not be considered as a source of funding or as a catalyst for action, and describes the adverse impacts of response measures in many developing countries, particularly those that are heavily dependent on a single sector or commodity.

The EU’s submission confirms that the EU is set to surpass its goal of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, and that the EU 2030 climate and energy framework will lead to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030; noting that the reduction target has been translated into a legislative framework that will ensure objectives are met. It also describes, inter alia, the EU’s share of global emissions, its specific mitigation efforts, and governance and an ongoing review of energy and climate policies in the EU.

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), the CARICOM submission reaffirms that 1.5°C mitigation pathways are the only way forward, and highlights that regional efforts are underway to provide detailed assessments of the impacts of 1.5°C warming. It states that CARICOM expects scientific evidence presented through the Talanoa Dialogue to highlight the need for more ambitious, updated NDCs by 2020 to enable vulnerable communities, such as those in small island developing States (SIDS), to survive.

China’s submission calls for climate targets to be aligned with the SDGs, and for global climate goals to be equitable, taking into account the principle of common but differential responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).

The EU stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.

The Arab Group’s submission supports a regime that acknowledges differing circumstances between developed and developing countries. It notes that the level of developing country actions directly relates to the level of developed country support, and highlights the need for adequate, predictable and sustainable means of implementation for developing countries to implement their NDCs and build resilience.

Underscoring the aim of collectively meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the temperature and long-term mitigation goals, the EU’s submission states that the EU’s NDC and its domestic mitigation targets are consistent with reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. It notes that the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) will provide clarity on the scale of the challenge to meeting the temperature goal, and on how this compares to the 2°C goal. The submission also discusses the need for creating enabling environments for transitioning to low emission development pathways, and progress made by various EU countries on such transition.

How do we get there?

On the third question (How do we get there?), submissions discuss various actions required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. China’s submission underscores the need to, inter alia, encourage technology innovation and enabling policies to promote an “energy revolution,” and accelerate structural changes in the economy to decouple emissions and economic growth. It calls for stimulating climate-friendly lifestyles, and providing developing countries with adequate financial, technological and capacity building resources for mitigation and adaptation actions.

In its submission, Fiji calls attention to the need for: adequate, predictable and sustainable finance for mitigation efforts; innovative climate finance; development of institutional capacity; access to technology; overcoming economies of scale; and enhancing national carbon sequestration. It also explains that Fiji will adopt “no regrets” adaptation measures, which include: better management of natural resources, particularly of coastal habitats, land and water; disease vector control; and improved spatial planning.

The Arab Group’s submission recommends, inter alia: ensuring that equity and CBDR are implemented across the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP); considering the impacts of the implementation of response measures and removing barriers that may hinder technology development and transfer; establishing a clear process for monitoring progress and reporting of financial support; and ensuring that the provision of funding achieves a balance between adaptation and mitigation.

The EU’s submission highlights the EU’s ongoing work on a proposed strategy for meeting the long-term Paris goals to be presented by the first quarter of 2019, noting that all its member States will develop national low-carbon mid-century strategies. The submission stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). It describes, among others, the EU policy framework for domestic action and preparing for enhanced action, and sectoral opportunities and policies to enable the transition. The submission outlines the EU’s assistance to other countries in transitioning towards low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways; and, stressing the need for a just transition, calls for mitigation action by and with non-Party actors.

Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This article provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received before the 2 April deadline from non-Party stakeholders.

Inputs submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The online portal will remain open for submissions throughout the year. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), most submissions demonstrate that current emission trajectories and policies are not in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, highlighting that impacts of climate change are already being felt, while also emphasizing positive actions that are already being taken by various actors but which need to be scaled up. A submission from UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) underlines that current national climate plans – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – would almost deplete the carbon dioxide budget for a 2°C scenario by 2030, and far exceed the 1.5°C budget. It underscores that more ambitious NDCs will be necessary by 2020, building on the existing extensive knowledge about cost-effective policies and measures that can be taken. Analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) of a range of studies shows that, even if fully implemented, current NDCs would lead to between 2.7-3.7ºC of warming.

The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) submission takes the assessment a step further, applying an equity lens to the NDCs of 32 Parties, representing 80% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing whether each NDC represents a fair contribution or not. The CAT findings show that not only are global efforts insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but furthermore, the majority of NDCs assessed were found to be inconsistent with the CAT criteria of a fair contribution. According to the submission, only seven governments of the 32 reviewed have implemented 1.5ºC or 2ºC targets, four of which, it claims, are not backed up by sufficient policy action. The CAT submission also shows that currently implemented policies are expected to result in a further growth of global GHG emissions by about 9-13% between 2020-2030.

A submission from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) considers the finance aspects of the current state of play, noting that while climate-related funding is increasing, it is not growing quickly enough to keep the world on a 2ºC pathway.

Many of the inputs also make note of the climate change impacts being felt already. ActionAid International’s submission, on behalf of the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance (CLARA), highlights the “irremediable impacts” the world is already seeing due to the current overall “lock-in” of 1ºC of warming, including the loss of human development potential, negative impacts on livelihoods, and damage to ecosystem integrity caused by climate change and inappropriate land-use purposes and practices.

Actions being taken by private actors also form the basis of several submissions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) submission provides an overview of positive change and commitments undertaken by investors, including: globally, the share of low-carbon supply-side energy investments grew by six percentage points to 43% from 2014-2016; over 50 investors have signed a statement of support for the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and investors holding US$28 trillion in assets under management have signed on to Climate Action 100+, a collaborative five-year global initiative committing investor signatories to engage actively with the world’s top emitting companies. A submission from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that over 350 companies have committed to setting science-based targets, which are absolute GHG emissions reductions in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C. However, while these actions demonstrate a positive direction, the IIGCC submission underscores that the existing action could and should be scaled up, noting the need for governments to set the right enabling policy frameworks, including clear, long-term legislative programmes it highlights as “critical to the ability of investors to assess and manage climate-related risks and to invest in opportunities that support a low carbon, more energy efficient and climate-resilient world.”

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), many of the submissions highlight the emissions reductions and mitigation actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the adaptation and resilience actions required to ensure a safe future. In line with the official mandate of the Talanoa Dialogue, many submissions refer specifically to the long-term goal reflected in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, outlining the need to phase-out net GHG emissions in the second half of the century at the latest, achieve peak emissions in all sectors – energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture – by 2020, and consider the overall carbon budget as guidance for enhancing NDCs in 2020, with UNEP calling this the “last opportunity to close the 2030 emissions gap.”

Noting that the world’s major economies subsidize investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction amounting to US$18-70 billion per year, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) submission outlines the need to curtail fossil fuel supply as an essential part of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, outlining a vision for a managed decline in fossil fuel use. The submission highlights the potential for such a transition to result in social and economic benefits, including through the reinvestment of added tax revenues from fossil fuel production, particularly if these are redirected towards meeting the SDGs. The WRI submission also highlights the need to ensure a vision in which the SDGs and climate action are mutually reinforcing, noting that climate impacts have the potential for detrimental effects on the achievement of the SDGs, whereas well-designed climate policy measures for mitigation and adaptation can advance core development objectives, including health (SDG 3), decent employment (SDG 8), energy access (SDG 7), transport accessibility (SDGs 9, 11), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and landscape protection and biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15).

How do we get there?

Having identified the significant gap between current actions and policies and that which is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the submissions relating to the third question (How do we get there?), identify policies, plans and sectoral actions that need to be put in place to achieve the long-term goals. Underscoring the need to enhance ambition, the submissions also highlight opportunities for broader achievement of social and economic benefits, and interlinkages with the SDGs.

Setting long-term, low-GHG emission development pathways is identified as a key tool in response to the third question. The submission by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) underscores that “developing national and local long-term pathways is critical for the low-carbon transition,” highlighting the importance of creating broad stakeholder ownership of a long-term vision, as well as informing short-term policy decisions in light of deep decarbonization goals.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) submission highlights the economic growth and new employment opportunities that can be created through a transition to a clean energy future, noting that the millions of new jobs that will be created in activities related to deployment and maintenance of renewables and energy efficiency measures would “more than offset” job losses in fossil fuel sectors. Specific policy measures suggested within the submission include: ensuring the quick implementation of renewable energy targets in current NDCs; considering options for strengthening renewable energy targets in NDCs; and broadening the scope of renewable energy components in NDCs.

Many submissions note the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector. Noting that the aviation sector currently accounts for 4.9% of the warming impact on earth, and that international shipping is responsible for 2.6% of global emissions, Climate Action Network (CAN), with the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), and Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), respectively, call for decarbonization pathways for these sectors to be developed, detailing the measures that can be taken to make these achievable, and highlighting the sensitivity of these sectors to climate change impacts. The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) submission, on behalf of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the SLoCaT membership, identifies 20 “quick win actions” for the transport sector as well as a “global macro roadmap” to achieve a net-zero emissions transport sector by 2060-2080.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) submission also recommends action to be urgently enhanced, highlighting the mutually reinforcing nature of well-designed economic and climate policies, which it claims could add 1% to average economic output in G20 countries by 2021, rising to almost 5% by 2050 if the economic benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding or storm damage, are factored in. Specifically, the OECD submission makes several recommendations, for example to integrate climate imperatives into structural reform and broader national development strategies, including sustainable infrastructure, “reflecting the role of the physical environment as a fundamental pillar for strong, sustainable, balanced growth.”

Many submissions also note the importance of non-state actors in advancing climate action, including cities, civil society, and corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, among others.

The Advisory Group is comprised of representatives of 50 organizations, including 21 from the UN system, as well governments, other international organizations and stakeholders.

The proposed Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action aims to catalyze time-bound and measurable actions, grouped into four interlinked categories:

Advancing SDG 7 implementation through: prioritizing clean-cooking solutions; closing the electricity access gap; accelerating the pace of transition towards renewable energy; scaling up investments in energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy; doubling global financing for SDG 7; scaling up capacity-building and education; enhancing innovation; and investing in data collection systems and data analysis.

through strengthening cooperation at the regional level and prioritizing ending energy poverty in the most vulnerable countries. Accelerating the transformation towards a sustainable and inclusive future by: promoting transformative investments; transforming human behavior from energy-intensive lifestyles to more sustainable patterns; strengthening decision-making through improvements in energy data collection, indicators and monitoring; and harnessing the power of all stakeholders to drive change.

Marcel Alers, UN Development Programme (UNDP), introduced the policy brief on financing SDG 7. He noted that there is a big financing gap for universal access to clean fuels, with current annual investment at US$240 million, versus annual funding needs of US$4.4 billion to 2030. He cautioned that investment is not spread equally, with developed and middle-income countries being able to access finance while many developing countries are currently left out. He emphasized that annual global financing for SDG 7 needs to double, from the current level of US$500 billion to US$1 to 1.2 trillion per year by 2030. He stressed that private finance is central to meeting SDG 7.

Noting that around 90% of the population is at risk of heart and lung disease due to air pollution exposure caused by inefficient use of energy, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO), presented the policy brief on energy and health. She announced that on 2 May WHO will launch new statistics on air pollution. She also underscored that all SDG 7 targets are critical enablers for universal health coverage and will advance progress towards achievement of SDG 3 (health).

Presenting the brief on energy and education (SDG 4), Rakshya Rajyashwori Thapa, UN International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said 300 million children are affected by the lack of energy in schools, 60% of which are girls. She noted that youth literacy levels are lower in countries with electrification rates below 80%, adding that efforts to electrify schools have lagged behind. She explained that the publication recommends, inter alia, adopting policies that incentivize and prioritize investment in energy access in the education sector, and catalyzing support through stakeholder engagement, public advocacy and outreach to influence decision makers.

Noting that more than 1 billion people lack access to electricity and more than 3 billion lack access to clean cooking, with women bearing the greatest burden of this energy poverty, Sheila Oparaocha, Executive Director, ENERGIA, presented the document on energy and gender (SDG 5). She said the publication recommends, inter alia: establishing gender responsive global and national energy sector policies; promoting and investing more in clean cooking technologies; and reducing barriers in the energy industry for women, while also increasing their representation in national and global energy bodies.

Rabia Ferroukhi, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), spoke about the role of SDG 7 in achieving SDG 8 (decent jobs and economic growth). She noted that renewable energy deployment has led to growing employment, and predicted that this trend will accelerate. She explained that the policy brief on energy and jobs recommends, inter alia: designing active labor market policies to respond to evolving market needs; coordinating education and training policies with the needs of the renewable energy sector; ensuring that jobs are decent; and undertaking measures to minimize disruptions in the energy transition through social protection measures and retraining efforts.

Sheila Watson, FIA Foundation, presented the policy brief on energy and transport (related to SDG 11). She explained that transport is the single largest energy user in many developed countries, while transport energy demand has been rising faster than in any other sector. She noted that energy consumption in the transport sector will continue to grow predominantly in developing countries. To respond to these trends, she said the publication recommends, inter alia:

implementing fuel economy policies to improve the efficiency of light and heavy duty vehicles and promoting electric and zero emission vehicles;

improving the efficiency of trucks, including fuel economy standards, and ‘green freight’ initiatives, including consolidated logistics;

phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies;

investing in safe walking and cycling infrastructure;

addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport; and

accelerating research in efficient batteries and energy storage systems.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative, UN Office of the High Representative of Least Developed Countries (UN-OHRLLS), said we must ensure that the most vulnerable will not be left behind. She identified two areas of action as essential: capacity building for countries on policy and project design for SDG 7; and facilitating access to finance for the most vulnerable countries. She added that political leadership and national strategies are essential for the achievement of SDG 7.

In the ensuing discussion, Denmark suggested reflecting this approach to SDG 7 in the HLPF Ministerial Declaration, and to highlighting at next year’s HLPF under the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that SDG 7 is essential to achieving all the other SDGs. Supported by Pakistan, she emphasized the need to focus on SDG 7 also as part of the Climate Summit to take place in September 2019 in New York, US. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) underscored the need for a conversation about rebalancing budgets to support sustainable energy. Other stakeholders focused on the need for rights-based approaches to partnerships that involve indigenous communities and to ensure inclusive benefits for them.

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

The note describes the general trends and contents of inputs, categorized according to the three questions of the Talanoa Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there?

The note, which synthesizes inputs received before 2 April 2018, is intended to facilitate Talanoa Dialogue discussions that will take place in parallel with the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The overview will be updated prior to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC, convening in Katowice, Poland, from 3-14 December, to capture inputs submitted by 29 October.

A total of 220 inputs met the 2 April deadline and were uploaded to the Talanoa Dialogue platform. Some answer all three questions, while others answer only one or two. 49 Parties submitted 15 inputs, including seven individual Parties and eight groups of Parties. The rest of the inputs are from non-Party stakeholders, including civil society, academia, research organizations, the private sector, subnational governments, international organizations and UN bodies.

Many inputs call for development paths that are just, inclusive, and consistent with human rights and equity.

Most of the inputs call for “wider and deeper” collaboration and partnerships, and say that the scale and pace of climate action must increase “dramatically and immediately” at the international, national and subnational levels. At the international level, inputs reflect the need for, inter alia, more ambitious and robust Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020, delivering on pre-2020 actions and a strong rule book for the Paris Agreement on climate change. At the national and subnational levels, inputs underscore the need to establish legal, policy, regulatory, fiscal, governance and investment frameworks to remove barriers, create incentives and mobilize broad action. Finance is a recurrent issue across all three questions, focusing on assessments of current finance levels or estimates of what is required to meet climate goals.

Many inputs refer to the moral dimension of climate change, and call for transitions and development paths that are just and inclusive, and consistent with human rights and equity. Some point to consequences from failing to fully apply the polluter-pays principle, and the benefits of policies like carbon pricing and phasing out perverse subsidies.

Highlighting synergies between climate action and sustainable development, inputs discuss links between meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. On resilience and adaptation, inputs highlight links between the Paris Agreement’s goals and those of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).

A total of 107 inputs address the first question (Where are we?), describing findings on greenhouse gases (GHGs) at the global, national or sectoral scale, setting out the state of play on climate impacts and vulnerability, showcasing initiatives and actions, and analyzing existing institutional arrangements.

A total of 114 inputs address the second question (Where do we want to go?), identifying aspirations in terms of global goals and principles for climate action, outlining emissions scenarios and trajectories compatible with goals, describing a future vision towards a zero-emissions world and climate resilience, outlining the stakeholders’ vision and ambition for themselves; and setting out expectations regarding future institutional arrangements.

A total of 148 inputs address the third question (How do we get there?), showcasing existing action on the ground that is achieving results and may be replicated and/or scaled-up, sharing knowledge on high-potential solutions, including technologies and collaboration models that may help accelerate climate action, and making recommendations for the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Convention bodies on issues to be addressed in international climate negotiations. They also make recommendations for national government action to ensure progress towards achieving the vision and ambition outlined in question 2, and for the private sector and intergovernmental organizations.

The May Talanoa Dialogue arrangements include an opening meeting on 2 May, in-depth discussion of the three questions on 6 May, a report-back meeting on 8 May and a closing meeting on 9 May.

The event took place on 22 April 2018, at the Westin Hotel Grand Central in New York, US, in advance of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum). The Fair was organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), in collaboration with the UN Global Compact, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Addressing lessons learned about investment, Cristina Duarte, Cabo Verde’s Former Minister of Finances, Planning and Public Administration, noted that building institutions and regulatory systems conducive to investment can take 10-15 years, and it requires policy coherence and integration. Admasu Nebebe, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Finance and Economic Cooperation, spoke about the importance of investing in human development, noting that Ethiopia is currently investing 25% of its national budget in education. He observed that Ethiopia is the country with the third-largest public investment in infrastructure, which he said is also essential for attracting private investment.

The acting mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, said the local government has collaborated with the national bank of Colombia to develop a strategy to target extreme poverty eradication and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Sergio Londoño Zurek, who is also the Director General of the Presidential Cooperation Agency (APC-Colombia), also reported that 55,000 people live in extreme poverty in his city.

Anne Simpson, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), observed that the SDGs bring benefits for pension funds because they address risks. She said that after the 2008 financial crisis, CalPERS decided to rethink investment in terms of long-term value creation, and concluded that it needs to manage three types of capital: financial; human; and natural. As these three types of capital are also addressed by the SDGs, she said, the Goals are great for the sustainable investments that funds must harness in order to pay pensions.

Simpson moderated a series of presentations on successful PPPs in Kenya, Nigeria and Brazil. Ormat Olkaria III (Kenya) – the first privately funded and developed geothermal plant in Africa – reflects the importance of successful risk allocation between the private sector and public sector in achieving efficiency. The project was funded through two separate rounds of equity and debt financing, resulting in profits for the private investor and a decrease in energy costs for consumers.

Among the ingredients that led to the project’s success, Paul Mbuthi, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, noted the government’s focus on removing barriers to investment such as tariffs, as well as shouldering the high costs of the first explorations. Nachman Isaac, Ormat, explained what makes projects bankable and thus prone to success: long-term power purchase agreements; strong sovereign support, including support letters from the government; strong existing provisions that guarantee the recovery of a sufficient part of the investment; international arbitration; stable and predictable regulatory frameworks; and risk sharing.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) – OLAM Farmers Partnership (Nigeria) provides smallholder rice farmers with access to a profitable and reliable market, and OLAM with a consistent source of high quality produce. The project leverages multilateral financing from IFAD to attract funding from a large multinational firm (OLAM) to provide a consistent source of income to small-scale farmers, which, in turn, should lead to increased capital investment by the small-scale farmers. Odoemena Benjamin, IFAD, said multilateral agencies can help governments catalyze the necessary resources for projects aligned with national needs and priorities.

The Renewable Energy Market and Pacific Hydro Wind Farms (Brazil) was financed by a national development bank, and shows that private infrastructure investment can be successful even without financing and/or guarantees from international lenders. Based on the success of this project, Pacific Hydro is currently pursuing several much larger renewable energy projects in Brazil, illustrating how smaller investments can spur larger-scale, long-term investments.

The panel discussions were followed by thematic parallel working groups on ‘Large-scale, Capital- intensive Infrastructure,’ ‘New Investment Opportunities in Agriculture,’ and ‘Innovative Financial Instruments to support the SDGs.’

This online platform brings together hundreds of data sets to facilitate users’ efforts to evaluate and visualize the state of the environment at local, national and global levels.

The platform offers dashboards and alerts to help users monitor environmental conditions. The platform facilitates access to data to help stakeholders make informed decisions about the environment and human well-being. It provides application programming interface (API) documentation to allow developers to pull its data into applications and encourages sharing maps or apps developed with Resource Watch data.

A launch event for the beta version of the platform took place on 11 April 2018, and was addressed by two keynote speakers: Gina McCarthy, former US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator, and Mae Jemison, former astronaut. McCarthy highlighted that, “Tools like Resource Watch are essential for making science accessible to decision makers, so we can turn science into actions that advance policies, technologies and products that improve public health.”

Other speakers included Andrew Steer, President and CEO of WRI, Jonathan Baillie, Chief Scientist and Senior Vice President of National Geographic Society, and Rebecca Moore, Director of Google Earth. Moore noted that Resource Watch builds on the foundation established with Global Forest Watch, an online platform that offers data and tools for monitoring forests.

Resource Watch is hosted and convened by WRI, with financial support from DOB Ecology and The Tilia Fund, and additional supporting and institutional grants. At the launch event, Maas Goote, CEO, DOB Ecology, highlighted that the decision to fund the development of Resource Watch was, in part, because WRI would place it in the public domain, with free access for all.

The SDGs aim to target different stakeholders, including businesses and development cooperation agencies, into “doing more and better with less"". Of the 17 SDGs, one goal that companies are adopting at the workplace is SDG 12, which aims to promote responsible consumption and production, resource and energy efficiency, and development of sustainable infrastructure within the workplace, among others.

For instance, some companies are integrating green practices in day-to-day functions, especially dry waste management and recycling. Eco-actions include promoting the use of ceramic mugs or glass cups for beverages to save on paper products, recycling office supplies such as discarded paper, purchasing recycled paper, and using refillable pens.

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), an advocacy organization, says the private sector is increasingly adopting practices that aim at reducing and recycling waste produced within the office premises. “These are very important strategies to change practices within offices that can then have a cumulative impact at a citywide scale,"" she notes.

E-commerce firm Flipkart, which has just moved into a new office building in Bengaluru this month, has replaced paper cups with ones made of ceramic and glass. Employees have been given stainless-steel water bottles that they can refill. “This one move is helping us save 4,000 litres of potable water every week, and not add 10,000 plastic bottles to landfills every year,"" says Nagaraj Kulkarni, senior director, projects, at Flipkart.

The company has also placed large bins at different points on each work floor to segregate wet and dry waste. To ensure this, and minimize the use of garbage bags, it does not allow dustbins at individual desks. These steps were taken after employee surveys, with ideas being developed over around 18 months.

As a part of its green initiative, online classifieds company OLX India has replaced the plastic tableware in its cafeteria with reusable cutlery. Paper recycle bins have been installed in its Gurugram office to store paper waste. “Every month, the collected paper waste is reused to produce reusable office stationery,"" says Varun Madan, head of human resources, OLX India.

Pune-based technology services company Persistent Systems has stopped the use of disposable plastic paper cups and plates, and is hoping to restrict the use of tissue paper. On an average, it dedicates around 10 days in a year to programmes such as “no plastic day"" or “zero food wastage week"", to reinforce sustainable consumption practices.

“We also run several environment conservation programmes, such as observing ‘no printer days’ to save paper,"" says Kedar Paranjape, chief administrative officer. Most of these initiatives—employee-led, and facilitated by internal teams and the Persistent Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm—are run through the year, adds Paranjape.

Some public sector utilities are also pitching in. Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL), a natural gas distribution company, has adopted initiatives such as the conversion of waste paper into writing pads and envelopes through a waste management enterprise, Sampurna Earth. “The aim is to drive both the individual (employee) and the organization towards eco-friendly practices,"" says Goutam Ghosh, technical director at MGL.

Some companies are taking the help of non-profits and social enterprises which provide services such as waste audits, designing waste management systems, monitoring waste generation, recycling and collection of paper waste, metallic and plastic materials.

“Most of the companies with whom we work are quite eager on sustainability. They use our recycled products that are processed from their waste,"" says Abdul Rahman Janoo, product manager at Waste Ventures India, a Hyderabad-based waste-management enterprise that has worked with around 13 companies, including Google India, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever and Amazon India.

It has also developed a software that allows companies to track waste generation, and design green strategies accordingly. “Through this process, for example, a company realized it was generating a lot of tetra-pack waste. After examining the information, instead of going with 100-200ml juice packs, the firm decided to use 2 litre boxes for its events and meetings. In that way, they reduced tetra pack waste from their premises by 30%,"" says Janoo.

What is helping to drive this change is the fact that firms are beginning to realize they must be seen as a “green company"" to attract the increasingly environmentally conscious consumer.

Roychowdhury notes that both growing consciousness and regulatory demand are influencing corporate policy. “Sustainability is also linked to economics, because at the end of the day you are saving resources. And if you are saving resources, the cost recovery of operations becomes much more efficient.""

The agreement was announced at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of the GEF-7 replenishment.

The meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 April 2018. The GEF-7 replenishment will formally conclude during the GEF Assembly, which will convene from 27-28 June 2018, in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

The talks for GEF-7 included a review of the ‘Sixth Overall Performance Study of the GEF’ (OPS6), which notes that the GEF occupies a unique space in the global environmental financing architecture because of its broad focus and role as a financial mechanism for environmental conventions. Participants also considered programming directions during GEF-7 (FY19-FY22), and recommended updates to the STAR allocation methodology, including measures to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable GEF-recipient countries, among others.

The talks for GEF-7 were called for in October 2016, at the 51st meeting of the GEF Council, which requested the Trustee, in cooperation with the Secretariat, to initiate the discussions. Subsequently, meetings took place in Paris, France (28-30 March 2017), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (3-5 October 2017), Brasília, Brazil (23-25 January 2018) and Stockholm, Sweden (25 April 2018). Participants in the negotiations included: existing and potential Contributing Participants; representatives from non-donor recipient countries representing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean; NGO/CSO representatives from a donor country-based NGO/CSO and a recipient country; representatives of the private sector; and representatives of GEF Agencies and the conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism.

The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol. The GEF also funds activities in the areas of sustainable forest management, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.

Previously, the GEF Trust Fund was replenished by US$2.75 billion (GEF-1), US$3 billion (GEF-2), US$3.13 billion (GEF-3), US$3.13 billion (GEF-4), US$4.34 billion (GEF-5) and US$4.43 billion (GEF-6).

83,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/canadian-audit-report-highlights-need-for-stronger-federal-leadership-for-sdg-implementation/,"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Canadian Audit Report Highlights Need for Stronger Federal Leadership for SDG Implementation,"24 April 2018: The Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development of Canada’s Office of the General Auditor has released a report on Canada’s preparedness to implement the SDGs. The audit concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs because, at the end of the audit, no governance structure, implementation plan or system to measure, monitor and report progress were in place.

To implement the SDGs domestically, national governments must not only take direct action, but also support implementation by other actors including cities, local communities, business and civil society organization, and develop a system to measure, monitor and report on progress. To assess – or audit – whether national governments are taking the necessary steps to fulfill these responsibilities, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Organizations (INTOSAI) developed a framework, and more than 80 audit organizations committed to performing such assessments. The audit for Canada based on the INTOSAI framework was presented by Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development Julie Gelfand, who is part of Canada’s office of the Auditor General.

The audit report titled, ‘Canada’s Preparedness to Implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,’ concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs. According to the report, at the end of the audit period in November 2017, no governance structure for implementation or implementation plan existed, only limited national consultations and engagements had occurred, and no system to measure, monitor and report on national progress was in place. However, the report notes that Canada’s federal budget, published after the audit concluded, provides for the establishment of an SDG Unit to support coordination of SDG implementation, and support for Statistics Canada to expand monitoring and reporting activities relating to SDG implementation.

On federal leadership, the report recommends:

Establishing a federal governance structure that clearly articulates roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of other responsible and accountable federal organizations;

Developing an inclusive communications plan and engagement strategy to raise awareness of the SDGs, and consult and engage other levels of government and Canadians, including measures to report the results of consultations and take them into account when establishing national targets; and

Establishing and communicating an implementation plan to achieve national targets and the SDGs in Canada, including: clearly defined and attributed accountabilities for involved federal organizations; provisions for effective cooperation with other levels of government and with relevant stakeholders; clear national targets; coherent actions, which will collectively achieve the national targets; and a system for measuring results and for monitoring and reporting national progress in SDG implementation.

The report further recommends that lead federal organizations and departments should analyze the extent to which their policies and programmes could contribute to SDG implementation in Canada, in order to set realistic targets and identify policy and programme gaps.

In ‘The Commissioner’s Perspective’ published by the Office of the Auditor General, Julie Gelfand concludes that three years after Canada committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda the audit shows that “Canada has yet to complete some of the fundamentals—such as establishing a governance structure and plan—to position itself to deliver on this international commitment.”

The report on Canada’s readiness to implement the SDGs is the first of a series of national audits in different countries expected to be released in the coming months. In early 2018, the government of the Netherlands released a report, also aligned with INTOSAI’s framework, finding that the Government needs to focus more on the importance of policy coordination and cooperation between central and local governments, the connection between the SDGs and the national budgetary cycle, and the need to better include SDGs and sustainable development in general in primary and secondary education.

Canada is expected to present its first Voluntary National Review on progress on SDG implementation at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), taking place in July. To prepare that report and strengthen SDG implementation, Global Affairs Canada recently launched a portal for consultations and laid out its plan for SDG implementation.

84,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-report-scores-countries-progress-towards-gender-equality/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Report Scores Countries' Progress Towards Gender Equality,"29 March 2018: The World Bank launched a report finding that, in 104 economies, at least one law or regulation prevents women from working in specific jobs, and 65 economies have implemented at least one reform that advances gender equality. The publication titled, ‘Women, Business and the Law 2018,’ is the fifth in a series of biennial reports that measure gender discrimination in legal treatment and its economic consequences.

The 2018 report focuses on seven indicators of gender equality and women’s economic participation: getting a job; providing incentives to work; accessing institutions; going to court; using property; building credit; and protecting women from violence. For the first time, the report provides scores for each indicator. The “getting a job” indicator had the highest number of reforms (28 economies) followed by the indicator on “building credit” (24 economies). The indicator on “using property” had the fewest number of reforms, with only Ecuador showing positive reform.

The UK, New Zealand and Spain each scored in the top 20 economies across all seven indicators. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income countries tend to have the highest average scores across the indicators, while economies in the Middle East and North Africa generally have the lowest average scores across most indicators, the authors note.

Over 2.7 billion women around the world are legally restricted from having the same job choices as men.

According to the report, over 2.7 billion women around the world are legally restricted from having the same job choices as men. On access to jobs, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working in 18 economies. In Bhutan, Guinea-Bissau, Pakistan and Suriname, women cannot register a business. The report describes how “legacy legislation” contributes to certain job restrictions that reflect outdated safety standards. For example, almost half of Commonwealth economies limits women’s jobs, with these restrictions dating back to the UK’s Mines and Collieries Act 1842. Similarly, eight out of nine Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) restrict women’s jobs, stemming from a 1932 Soviet Union Law, and 75% of Francophone Africa economies restrict women’s employment as a remnant of a 1954 French West African ordinance.

On protecting women from violence, 59 economies lack laws on sexual harassment in the workplace. In the Middle East and North Africa, 35% of the economies received a score of zero on the indicator, meaning that there are no laws or regulations that protect women from violence. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 19% of economies scored zero on the indicator. In addition, Haiti, the Federated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan also received a zero.

More than one-third of economies still restrict women’s agency and freedom of movement. Such restrictions cover applying for a passport or national identity card, choosing where to live, being the head of a household, or traveling outside the home or country, among others.

Over the last two years, there have been 87 changes towards legal gender equality across 65 economies. Four out of the five economies implementing the most reforms are in Sub-Saharan Africa: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. The DRC reformed its family code, allowing married women to get jobs, sign contracts, open bank accounts and register businesses in the same way as married men. The DRC also removed restrictions on women’s ability to work at night, and removed the obligation for a married woman to obey her husband. Kenya enacted its first domestic violence law, and has improved access to credit information. Bulgaria, Kiribati and Poland eliminated all restrictions on women’s employment. Colombia’s Constitutional Court found labor code prohibitions on women’s work in mining and other “arduous” or “hazardous” jobs to be discriminatory.

The report features a case study on women’s financial inclusion that examines how legal and regulatory environments influence women’s demand for financial services.

The NAP Expo aimed to discuss country experiences, best practices, lessons learned, gaps and needs, and information on support provided and received in relation to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. It also offered a platform for countries to interact with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and others providing support for NAPs, as a means to improve access to financing for NAPs.

The event convened amidst alarm bells sounded by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who called for “a race to the top – with political will, innovation, financing and partnership” to counter “the most systemic threat to humankind” that is climate change. [Opening Remarks at Press Encounter on Climate Change by UN Secretary General António Guterres] [UNFCCC Press Release]

Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under NDCs.

The urgent need for adaptation action in light of the “relentless pace of climate change” is reflected in recent updates from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO confirmed the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to be among the most destructive on record, with damage costs exceeding US$250 billion in the US alone, and March 2018 to be the third warmest on record. [WMO Press Release on 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season] [WMO Press Release on March 2018]

The main topics of NAP Expo 2018 were: systematic observations, monitoring and evaluation, and learning from experience from past climate shocks; assessing vulnerability and risk; designing implementation strategies while taking into account vertical and horizontal integration, and different pathways over time; and financial support for the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

Areas of adaptation addressed at the Expo included: climate information services (CIS), climate data and scenarios; monitoring and evaluation; linkages among adaptation, the SDGs and disaster risk reduction (DRR); consideration of gender in NAPs; lessons learned from the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs); long-term adaptation planning and transformation; adaptation in the agriculture sector; water crises and other climate shocks; adaptation in human settlements; and applying traditional and indigenous knowledge. Emerging topics such as big data and artificial intelligence were also discussed.

NAP Expo 2018 was the fifth consecutive NAP Expo, organized by the UNFCCC Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) in collaboration with various organizations.

The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF) in 2010. Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The process is supported by the LEG and though initiatives such as the NAP Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) and the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs Programme (NAP-Ag). NAP-GSP is a joint programme by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to assist developing countries to advance NAPs. NAP-Ag, carried out jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and UNDP, focuses on climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector.

At the Expo, the NAP Global Network Secretariat, hosted by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), presented its recently published synthesis report titled, ‘Towards Gender-Responsive National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Processes: Progress and Recommendations for the Way Forward,’ which analyzes progress on integrating gender considerations in NAP processes.

86,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-ready-player-one,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Ready Player One’,"The sell for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is a little like the sell for Jurassic Park, except instead of dinosaur shock and awe, it’s pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe.

So the T-rex from Jurassic Park is actually in there, along with King Kong, the Iron Giant, Lara Croft, Marty McFly’s time-traveling DeLorean and Adam West’s Batmobile, a notable weapon from the Alien franchise, an iconic setting from a celebrated horror movie, an ’80s-centric score that includes Van Halen, Tears for Fears and Joan Jett, and far, far too many video game and cinematic homages and Easter eggs to document, even if I saw the movie a dozen times, which would definitely be at least 10 times too many.

Worlds collide in Ready Player One in a digital mashup multiverse called the OASIS, a sci-fi virtual vale akin in its own way to J.M. Barrie’s Neverland or C.S. Lewis’ Narnia, a patchwork of disparate mythologies all hugger-mugger. (Barrie juxtaposes pirates, mermaids, fairies, American Indians and flying children; Lewis draws on Greco-Roman and Norse mythology, Hans Christian Andersen, Beatrix Potter and Kenneth Grahame, Arthurian legend, Father Time and even Father Christmas, and, of course, the Bible.)

J.R.R. Tolkien detested such pastiches, but the sort of person who loves Tolkien for the encyclopedic depth of Middle-earth will often love the very different encyclopedic quality of Narnia — or the OASIS.

Ready Player One is a curator’s garden of delights, and if you love the sort of things that go into it and you don’t mind your carrots and peas touching (the way Tolkien did), this movie might be your candy store.

You know there’s a “but” coming, right?

The world of the OASIS exists in 2045 alongside an oppressive dystopian future from which the virtual reality of the OASIS is the only escape for most people.

Take our hero, a young orphan named Wade Watts (The Tree of Life’s Tye Sheridan), who lives in the high-rise trailer-park slums of what used to be Columbus, Ohio, with his aunt and her abusive boyfriend (Susan Lynch and Ralph Ineson).

Wade’s life is lived as Parzival, a digital character with a shock of fair hair like The Legend of Zelda’s Link (circa Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, twin hanks flowing like curtains framing his forehead) and a sword emblem on the back of his jacket in token of his Arthurian nom de jeu.

And here’s the thing: Ready Player One, adapted from Ernest Cline’s novel by Zac Penn and Cline himself, wants to go all in on pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe in virtual-reality fantasy — but it also wants to leave us with the salutary notion that reality is, like, important, too (so kids, remember to unplug, go outside and interact with people in real life).

After all, reality is “the only place you can get a decent meal,” according to tech wizard James Halliday (Mark Rylance), co-creator of the OASIS. Well, actually, Halliday is dead, so it’s a digital version of him in the OASIS who says the thing about decent meals.

But Ready Player One isn’t interested in decent meals, and we never see anyone preparing or enjoying one. Anyway, Halliday is referencing Groucho Marx, so the movie’s best line about “reality” is just one more blasted Easter egg.

Reality is also purportedly the only place where a boy and a girl can really get to know one another, fall in love and certainly kiss. Anyway, Wade is perhaps meant to look foolish for thinking he’s in love with a legendary gamer he knows only by her digital alter ego, Art3mis, a punk-rock action heroine with spiky pink hair and anime-ish oversized eyes.

Certainly Art3mis thinks Wade a fool, and pointedly tells him that he knows nothing about her; certainly she doesn’t actually look like her avatar. And Wade definitely makes a serious mistake by giving Art3mis his real name inside the OASIS. (Always remember, kids, how very foolish it is to give strangers personal information online.)

But eventually Wade meets the face behind Art3mis, which belongs to Samantha Cook (Ouija’s Olivia Cooke), and his digital crush merges pretty seamlessly into the real world. Fortunately for Wade, Samantha is a) actually female, b) actually attractive, and c) neither too old nor too young for him. This does not go without saying (in the OASIS nobody knows you’re a dog).

Samantha isn’t even a different skin tone from Wade, which might not have mattered, except insofar as not mattering would have mattered. She does have a feature she is embarrassed about, which Wade pointedly dismisses as unimportant to him. That Wade himself lacks Parzival’s sculpted cheeks and flippy white locks does not come up.

Eventually there is a real-world kiss, but the individuals in question have spent very little real-world time together. The bottom line is that Ready Player One wants to tell us that reality matters, but the movie really has no interest in its posited “reality” — which is, of course, just a grimmer and less stimulating fantasy.

The plot pits Wade, Samantha and a trio of allies — Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zhao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) — collectively known as the “High Five” against the ruthless CEO of Innovative Online Industries, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn).

At stake: total control of the OASIS. The arena: a series of competitive challenges embedded in the OASIS by Halliday before his death. Yes, rebel gamers must play video games to save the internet from a corporate villain. Remember, this is the movie’s “real world.”

Resolving the challenges involves getting inside Halliday’s head and understanding his defining regrets in life: love lost through fear; friendship lost through resentment. (Don’t be afraid to take the risk, to kiss the girl, to face your pain.)

These are potentially potent themes, but, despite another soulful performance by Rylance, Halliday never emerges as a vital character whose regrets in life amount to much more than scavenger-hunt clues, Maguffins, Rosebuds. The man is (let’s remember) dead, and, while his OASIS alter ego, Anorak, lives on, it’s not him.

It’s not impossible that the figure of Halliday could have had some real poignance. Not only is he played by Rylance, on some level he parallels Spielberg, who did as much as anyone to create the world of 1980s pop-culture nostalgia celebrated here. (Ready Player One doesn’t explicitly celebrate the Spielberg legacy as much as it might have — for one thing, Spielberg didn’t want to make it all about him, and in some cases the rights to certain properties weren’t available anyway — but in any case it’s impossible to imagine the Iron Giant without E.T. or Lara Croft without Raiders of the Lost Ark.)

Perhaps flashbacks of the real Halliday, scattered throughout the film, would have made the theme of middle-aged regret more vital. Perhaps if the drama ultimately turned on vital real-world relationships, the theme of embracing reality wouldn’t feel like a tacked-on public-service announcement.

Perhaps if saving the world involved more than battling a corporate suit for control of the OASIS — perhaps if it involved people’s real-world needs and the lousy state of the world — it might even be moving.

Hey! Did I mention Art3mis drives Kaneda’s bike from Akira and a knife-wielding Chucky shows up to wreak mayhem? Would you believe there are nods to Speed Racer and ThunderCats? How about Battletoads and Halo? I’m just scratching the surface.

87,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-devil-and-father-amorth,"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Devil and Father Amorth’,"The director of The Exorcist makes a documentary about the most famous exorcist of modern times. The result is not greatly to either of their credit.

“He who sups with the devil,” a wise medieval proverb has it, “needs a long spoon.”

William Friedkin, forever known as the director of The Exorcist, may or may not appreciate that proverb, but in The Devil and Father Amorth, a 69-minute documentary featuring Father Gabriele Amorth — perhaps the world’s best-known exorcist until his death in 2016 — Friedkin does interview two people who clearly do.

One is Jeffrey Burton Russell, a historian noted for a five-volume history of demonology who talks about how depressing it was to “work with evil all the time.” His advice: “Don’t concentrate on the devil all the time. … Concentrate on the good, concentrate on God, concentrate on the positive, and don’t think that much about the evil side.”

The other is Bishop Robert Barron, the winsome and media-savvy auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles and founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries. To Friedkin’s astonishment, Bishop Barron adamantly pronounces himself unworthy of “getting in close quarters” with the devil. “People like Father Amorth may be able to do it,” he says cautiously. “I would never dare to do it.”

Clearly, Father Amorth dares. Over a 30-year career, from 1986 to 2016, he performed what he claimed were hundreds of thousands of exorcisms (160,000 as of 2013), averaging up to nine exorcisms per day for years at a time — a furious rate that has elicited astonished criticism from sober Catholic commentators like canonist Edward Peters and apologist Jimmy Akin. (Full disclosure: I know both Ed and Jimmy, especially Jimmy, who is an old and close friend.)

Often wrongly billed as “the chief exorcist of the Vatican” or “the pope’s exorcist,” Father Amorth was never attached to the Holy See, but to the Diocese of Rome, where he was authorized to act as an exorcist but had no special title.

Still, as a co-founder of the International Association of Exorcists, the author of a number of books about demons and exorcism, and a frequent public commenter in the media, he was the de facto public face of the exorcist community. In this capacity, he was known for sensational, extravagant claims, most famously condemning the Harry Potter books as satanic in origin and pronouncing not only Hitler and Stalin, but all rank-and-file Nazis, to be demon-possessed.

None of this comes up in The Devil and Father Amorth. In fact, other than the 20 minutes or so of handheld video footage of the exorcism of an Italian woman — her ninth exorcism, administered on Father Amorth’s 91st birthday, less than five months before his death — we see very little of the celebrity priest himself.

Instead, after an extended introduction filmed at various locations connected with Friedkin’s more famous movie, including Georgetown’s iconic Exorcist steps, the balance of the film is largely made up of interview footage.

Interview subjects include a brother and sister who credit Father Amorth with successfully exorcising the sister, a second woman who is the subject of the present exorcism, and a number of talking heads. Among these are Friedkin’s Exorcist collaborator, the late William Peter Blatty, who adapted his own novel for the screen, and a number of eminent medical and psychological authorities who speak cautiously about the limits of their fields and diagnoses like dissociative trance disorder.

Friedkin makes much of the novelty of his filming of an exorcism, asserting that the Vatican has never before given permission for an exorcism to be filmed. Actually, the Vatican does not directly oversee all exorcisms worldwide, and exorcisms have been filmed before.

For instance, in 1991, ABC’s 20/20 filmed and broadcast the exorcism of a woman who was said to have been inhabited by as many as 10 demons, most memorably one who self-identified as “Minga.”

That 1991 broadcast included moments more striking than anything in Friedkin’s footage of Cristina, administered at the Society of St. Paul congregational residence in Rome where Father Amorth lived and worked.

Although Father Amorth tells us that the devil speaks and acts through Cristina, it seems the devil has little on his mind beyond angry recalcitrance.

The ritual begins with the priest, his long purple stole draped over Cristina’s shoulders, along with a large rosary around Cristina’s neck, thumbing his nose at the devil as he leads Cristina and about a dozen of her family members in the Lord’s Prayer.

Among others, Father Amorth invokes Padre Pio and his own mentor, Father Candido Amantini, who also performed exorcisms for some 30 years. On the wall over Cristina’s head is a photograph of Pope Francis, who has talked more about Satan than the last two popes combined.

Presently, Cristina becomes agitated and begins rocking and writhing in her chair, obliging others to restrain her. Her outbursts — generally inarticulate snarls and cries like “No!” and “Stop!” — are uttered in a voice that sounds unmistakably like an audio editing chorus effect. I am only a permanent deacon and a film critic, not a priest and certainly not an exorcist, but if Cristina’s voice hasn’t been digitally tweaked, for my money the devil needs a new sound design team.

Friedkin’s audio chicanery detracts from what seems to be the sincerity of the woman’s distress, whatever its origin or nature. The very humdrum nature of her outbursts supports their authenticity; a calculated or scripted performance would presumably be more dramatic.

“Send the priest away! I can’t stand it!” she cries. “She belongs to me!” She refuses to answer the priest’s questions about when the possessions began and identifies herself as “Satan” and “legion” or “armies.” At one point, Father Amorth sternly tells the evil spirit it is damned forever and gets the reply, “It’s you who are damned!”

One of the more intriguing exchanges is left untranslated. When Father Amorth asks her how many devils are with her, she says something that sounds like “80 million,” but on cross-examination clarifies as “80 chiefs” (Italian capi).

Sometime after the ordeal is over comes a bizarre coda in which Cristina and her boyfriend allegedly arranged to meet Friedkin in the town of Alatri’s Cathedral Basilica of St. Paul (“considered to be a sacred place,” Friedkin hilariously clarifies, in case this is unclear).

Friedkin offers a complicated account for why this encounter, which winds up taking place in another church, wasn’t filmed, but the bottom line is that we have only his lurid account, scored with screeching strings and dramatized with impressionistic images and sounds, blending the earlier exorcism with glimpses of the church’s interior. Make of it what you will.

Toward the end of The Devil and Father Amorth comes an anecdote that made me cringe. Father Amorth couldn’t wait to reach heaven, an acquaintance says with a chuckle — so that he could beat the devil with a cane. I hope the one-liner does the man a disservice.

If Cristina and Father Amorth seem sincere, the same cannot be said of the filmmaker. Beyond the audio effects and the suspicious unfilmed incident, Friedkin seems more interested in spinning his interview subjects’ answers than in hearing out their perspectives.

For Blatty — a practicing Catholic who researched the real story behind The Exorcist for a nonfiction account, and fictionalized it only when he couldn’t get the family’s permission to write the real story — the hunt for the devil was genuinely part of a larger quest for God.

Friedkin gestures toward this pious move in the closing seconds of the film, but there’s no hint of such a sentiment in the preceding 60-odd minutes.

Whatever Bishop Barron or others may have said about God or Jesus, virtually nothing of this sort made it to the screen. Nor is there any perspective on behaviors that might open the door to demonic influence: involvement in occult activity, magic or divination, for instance.

In a secular age, the mystery of evil can serve for some as a useful signpost to the greater power of good. Sometimes, though, people don’t see past the sign itself, and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in 1975, rightly warned against “obsessional preoccupation with Satan and the demons.”

There is little, if any, genuinely religious dimension to The Devil and Father Amorth. It’s basically a “boo” movie in documentary form — that, and an exercise in brand reinforcement and exploitation.

In an era of found-footage horror movies, genre fans may get a kick from the suggestion that there could be something to this “woo-woo” after all.

Pious viewers may be gratified by the film’s validation of their worldview and the reverential treatment of a conservative fire-and-brimstone clergyman. Skeptics will find confirmation of their disbelief in the film’s evident jiggery-pokery. Few, perhaps, will find much to challenge the preconceptions they sat down with.

SDG’s Adopt-A-Road program continues to tackle the annual springtime mess.

Open to various groups of volunteers, families or neighbours, the initiative helps clean up the environment and produce more scenic roadways as participants collect refuse and debris from the side of their “adopted” county road.

The involved groups sign a two-year agreement with the United Counties to pick up trash over a minimum two kilometres on a county road twice a year, usually in the spring and fall. In return, SDG erects a sign at each end of the adopted section with the group’s name, reminding motorists of their work for the good of community and environment. Participants also receive safety training vests, gloves and garbage bags, along with any necessary support to ensure preparation for the task.

If you’re willing to part with a few hundred dollars US, you can get some serious hardware that a decade ago would have been effectively outside the reach of the hobbyist. Right now you can order a four channel oscilloscope for less than what a new Xbox costs; but which one you’ll rack up more hours staring at slack-jawed is up to you.

Of course, these “cheap” pieces of equipment aren’t always perfect. [Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking. Fortunately, the function generator accepts an external clock which can be used to increase its accuracy, so he decided to build one.

[Paul] starts off by going over the different options he considered for this project, essentially boiling down to whether or not he wanted to jump through the extra hoops required for an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). But the decision was effectively made for him when his first attempt at using a more simplistic temperature controlled oscillator failed due to an unfortunate misjudgment in terms of package size.

In the end, he decided to spring for the OCXO, and was able to use the USB port on the front panel of the SDG 1025 to provide the power necessary for the crystal to warm up and remain at operating temperature. After he got the oscillator powered, he just needed to put it in a suitable metal enclosure (to cut down external interference) and calibrate it. [Paul] cleverly used the NIST WWV broadcast and his ears to find when his frequency standard overlapped that of the source, therefore verifying it was at 10 MHz.

Hackers love accuracy, and accordingly, we’ve seen a number of frequency standard builds ranging from extremely cheap to luxuriously overkill.","[Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking.

Mohammed who addressed the ongoing gathering of more than 1,200 researchers, academics and policymakers in a televised message said SBCC is playing important role in engaging young people, empowering victims and shifting attitudes.

“Social behaviour change is critical to addressing gender inequality. The media, entertainment, education and technology sector play important role in helping us mobilize in these constituencies, engage young people, empower victims and shift attitudes.

“The social behaviour change community is well placed to contribute and add meaning. You have the proven ability to harness the power of communication. You are a vibrant community shown by the presence of over 1200 practitioners, researchers, academics and policymakers.

“The United Nations looks forward to working with you and other stakeholders to fully integrate social behaviour communication strategy into development agenda and practice. Together, we can transform societies and our future and uphold our promise to leave no one behind,” Mohammed said.

Earlier in her welcome remarks, the Executive Director, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Program (CCP) Susan Krenn said the presence of so many professionals at the conference will deliver insights that would serve the community of communicators for many years to come.

Among this community of communicators at the summit, are Nigerian organisations including Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI), Save The Children, Centre for Communication and Social Impact (CCSI), UNICEF Nigeria, USAID Nigeria, African Radio Drama Association (ARDA) and Breakthrough Action, among others.

The Minister of Health, Republic of Indonesia, Dr Nila Moeloek who delivered a keynote address said SBCC has the power to change norms and attitudes adding that SBCC is important because it has the power to change people’s lives.

“I am fully aware of the importance of SBCC in improving people’s lives. Indonesia has put this to use in reducing open-air defecation and the use of Sulphur in washing hands. SBCC was key in the fight against Ebola outbreak in Africa and when we had the bird flu (H5N1) strain, communication strategies helped us to overcome this and we were able to change the attitude of both buyers and sellers,” she noted.

The Minister who was represented by the Health Economics Advisor, Dr Mohammad Subur also noted that the social media will be a critical tool in SBCC communication.

The conference has participants from at least 93 countries, 222 sessions, 58 exhibition booths, 1,150 attendees, 20 sponsors, with 1,300 abstracts submitted and 429 organisations represented.","The UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed made this known in Bali, Indonesia at the opening plenary of the 2nd International Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) Summit on Monday.

The note was prepared in order to advance discussions at the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48), convening during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany.

The document (FCCC/SBSTA/2018/INF.2) provides information on cooperative activities, initiatives and programmes since the SBSTA 46. On the relationship with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the document explains that the 2030 Agenda recognizes the UNFCCC as the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and that the UNFCCC Secretariat can help countries achieve the SDGs. It describes UNFCCC activities towards SDG implementation, focusing mainly on SDG 13 (climate action), as well as engagement with activities and relevant agencies for achieving SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 15 (life on land).

The document showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with UNEP, FAO and ILO, among others.

On mitigation-related cooperative activities, the note highlights implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the role of the NDC Partnership, which supports developing countries in implementing their NDCs and achieving the SDGs. It showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with, inter alia: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to support climate and SDG-aligned finance and investment action in the context of sustainable development; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) to enhance countries’ capacities to integrate adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs into activities in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work.

On technology, the note outlines cooperation related to, inter alia, the technology facilitation mechanism to support implementation of the SDGs. It highlights the Secretariat’s participation in the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and in the high-level seminar on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

The note also describes cooperative activities related to climate finance, capacity building, adaptation and action for climate empowerment (ACE). It underscores the UNFCCC’s participation in a review forum for the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, which discussed the role of teachers and teacher training, as well as implementation of education for sustainable development in achieving SDG target 4.7 (ensuring all learners acquire knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development).

Additionally, the note provides an overview of activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) that help achieve the SDGs. On SDG target 2.4, on ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices, the document highlights the UNFCCC’s role in identifying knowledge gaps around agriculture and fisheries that hinder implementation and scaling up of adaptation.

On SDG target 5.5, on ensuring women’s participation and equal opportunities for leadership, the document references knowledge resources on gender-sensitive approaches and tools for adaptation. On SDG target 11.3, on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the note highlights a synthesis report on adaptation in human settlements, prepared under the NWP, which shares key findings, good practices and lessons learned on adaptation in human settlements. Regarding SDG target 11.B, on increasing the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing mitigation and adaptation policies and plans, the document outlines the Secretariat’s efforts to catalyze climate resilience action in human settlements through an adaptation knowledge portal.

The document also describes NWP activities related to: SDG target 6.A, on expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes; SDG target 9.A, on facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries; and SDG 13. The note also highlights the potential of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform to help advance the SDGs, particularly SDG target 13.B, on promoting mechanisms for building capacity for climate change-related planning and management for local and marginalized communities.

His proposed reorganization includes the creation of a Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and a Department of Operational Support, which would be focused on surge support to entities in weak environments.

An informal meeting of the UN General Assembly will convene on 22 May 2018, in New York, US, to hear a briefing from the Secretary-General on the proposals contained in the report. The UNGA’s Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) also will meet to consider the report.

Through its resolution 72/266, adopted on 21 December 2017, the UN General Assembly welcomed Guterres’ commitment to improving the UN’s ability to deliver on its mandates through management reform, approved some changes, and indicated that it looked forward to receiving a comprehensive report on further proposals. The report published on 21 March 2018 (A/72/492/Add.2) is titled, ‘Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations: implementing a new management architecture for improved effectiveness and strengthened accountability.’

Guterres’ third report to Member States on his envisaged management reforms contains proposals aimed at: eliminating duplicative functions; establishing a clearer division of roles and responsibilities; and ensuring that appropriate checks and balances are in place. The report specifies that both proposed departments would service and support the entire UN Secretariat at the global, regional and national levels.

The overarching goals of the management reform proposals are:

bringing decision-making closer to the point of delivery;

simplifying rules, policies and procedures;

decentralizing authority; and

enabling interoperability across the UN system.

The report explains that the two new departments would be created by reorganizing two existing departments, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management, and that the new functions would be created within existing resources through the reassignment and redeployment of existing posts. In order to minimize disruptions in support and to leverage the specialized knowledge and relationships that have been built up over time, the publication envisages, offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions will continue to deliver location-dependent services, on the one hand, and operational support functions to their existing clients on behalf of the Department of Operational Support, on the other.

While the restructuring of the two departments is cost-neutral, the report says, some additional financial resources may be required to lay the foundation necessary to establish the new structures as from 1 January 2019, including for aligning capacities with the level of additional delegations of authority, training and transfer or possible agreed separation of staff, which may be required “in exceptional situations.” The document notes that no additional resources are being requested of the UNGA, as the Secretariat will seek to meet the needs through voluntary contributions.

The Secretary-General also proposes measures to build a culture that is focused more on results than on processes, manages risk better, values innovation, and demonstrates a greater readiness to take prompt corrective action. The text also notes that the Umoja Extension 2 strategic planning, budget formulation and performance management solution, to be deployed in September 2018, will enable planning and reporting on use of resources based on results frameworks, including contributions to the SDGs. This will include risk-based dashboards for programme delivery, which will permit visualization of the impact of UN’s work through performance indicators.

In the report’s introduction, Guterres says that, taken together, his reports on the repositioning of the UN development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the restructuring of the UN’s peace and security pillar, and shifting the UN management paradigm comprise a road map for strengthening UN’s capacities to deliver on its mandate.

The trends are particularly concerning regarding energy access and clean cooking fuels, whereas progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy is accelerating.

The publication provides a global overview on progress towards SDG 7 and its targets relating to energy access including access to clean cooking fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It concludes that the rate of progress on all targets is insufficient to achieve SDG 7. At the same time, the analysis shows that the rate of increasing access to electricity has recently overtaken the rate of population growth for the first time, and that energy efficiency is increasing in the industrial sector. The publication further notes that country experiences indicate which mix of targeted policies and international support can be successful in promoting clean energy and energy access around the world.

“We must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.” – Adnan Z. Amin, Director-General, IRENA

Presenting the report at the 4th Sustainable Energy for All Forum, held from 2-3 May 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin said, “the report is an important signal that we must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.”

Specific findings on SDG 7 targets include:

Access to electricity: One billion people (13% of the world population) continue to live without electricity. At current rates, 674 million people would remain without access to electricity in 2030. Experience in a few countries has shown that home solar energy systems or mini-grids are a promising technology to provide access in rural areas.

Access to clean cooking fuels: Three billion people (40% of the world population) remain without access to clean cooking fuels. The resulting indoor air pollution causes approximately 4 million deaths per year. The main reasons for lack of progress are low consumer awareness, financing gaps, slow technological progress and lack of fuel distribution infrastructure.

Energy efficiency: Global GDP continues to decouple from growth in energy demand with energy intensity declining on average 2.2% per year, compared to 2.6% required to double energy efficiency by 2030. Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked.

Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked. Renewable energy: Modern renewable energy use (excluding traditional uses of biomass) has increased to 9.6% of global energy consumption and is projected to reach 21% by 2030 under current policies. This is insufficient to achieve the “substantial increase” required under target 7.2 and to mitigate climate change. While falling costs have accelerated growth in renewable electricity to 22.8% per year in some countries, electricity only represented 20% of final energy consumption in 2015. Growth in the use of renewables in transport and heating is much slower at 2.8% per year.

The report was published jointly by the custodian agencies for SDG 7, which include the International Energy Agency (IEA), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), UN Statistics Division, World Bank Group, and World Health Organization (WHO).

The two-day expert group meeting, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), featured in-depth discussions on climate action, ocean action, plastic pollution in the ocean, food loss and waste, and sustainable transport as they relate to SCP.

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is one of the six Goals for which governments will conduct an in-depth review at the HLPF’s 2018 session. During the expert group meeting, participants recalled that SDG 12 is the “least well resourced” SDG, according to a report of the UN Secretary-General.

On SDG 12 stocktaking and HLPF preparations, Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA, said the market is “not getting it right” on the true costs of consumption and production. He highlighted the extensively interlinked nature of the SDGs and targets, and called for using empirical information to decide which interlinkages to prioritize for action, but said these choices must be context-specific.

Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of Secretariat of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (10YFP) at the UN Environment Programme, reported on the formation of the ‘One Planet Network,’ a multi-stakeholder network that will serve as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12. Cecilia Lopez Y Royo Di Taurisano, 10YFP Secretariat, said most activity has taken place in the area of SCP readiness, with less activity in SCP implementation. She reported a notable increase in the number of SCP policies and instruments, but said approximately half of these are voluntary, and only 11% are financial instruments.

Participants discussed the need to make an economic case for SCP at the global level, and considered whether the private sector will respond to potential efficiency gains as an incentive to improve SCP, or only regulation. One suggested the need for better branding of SCP. On SCP’s interlinkages with other issues, a government representative highlighted her country’s toolbox to allow national focal points to bring SCP to the table of negotiations in other areas.

The idea that SCP is highly interlinked with other Goals continued to emerge in the session on climate action. Annika Lindblom, Finland’s Ministry of the Environment and Secretary General of the National Commission on Sustainable Development, said SCP “directs attention to the interface of climate and poverty.” She said Finland has combined the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change in order to address material usage and energy usage together. The framework is called ‘Carbon Neutral and Resource-wise Finland,’ and includes a medium-term climate policy plan to 2030 and action plans on procurement, product innovation and support for investments.

Hannah Janetshek, German Development Institute, said that while SDG 12 can have “strong co-benefits across the entire agenda,” it could also increase competition for resources, especially as policies seek to expand access to services in order to leave no one behind.

Mathilde Bouyé, World Resource Institute (WRI), said targets from SDGs 11 and 12 are poorly reflected in the NDCs, specifically 11.6, 11.c, 12.3 and 12.c. Jocelyn Blériot, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, added that so far, the focus of a low-carbon economy has been on energy, with less emphasis on raw material extraction and production. He called for an approach beyond ‘Recycling 2.0.’ With three billion new consumers coming soon, he said we must think differently, such as shifting from selling goods to selling services.

Suggesting that “most people don’t care about the impact of what they buy,” moderator David O’Connor, WRI, suggested that businesses should force people to opt out of positive behaviors rather than require them to opt in. Blériot suggested that regulations are needed in addition to business-led action, and said a number of governments are creating circular economy road maps, including Finland and France, in which businesses must consider what will happen to a product at the end of its first useful life.

In the course of the meeting, participants identified tradeoffs between SDG-related issues that have implications for SCP. These include:

Energy efficiency can be improved by certain thermostats, but recycling could be a challenge given the rare pollutants they contain. Similar challenges were noted with disposal of solar panels.

Lego plans to begin producing blocks out of sugarcane instead of plastic, but harvesting the needed sugarcane could increase land competition.

Plastics are part of the packaging innovations that have reduced food waste.

The interests of marginalized groups could come into conflict with the creation of marine protected areas.

Given these and other trade-offs, Gerald Singh, University of British Colombia, called for choosing priorities to prepare for “sub-aspirational” SDG scenarios. Bouyé said some countries are creating incentives and compensations for vulnerable populations who may be affected by SCP implementation. For example, El Salvador and France are among those including a climate solidarity package in their NDCs.

Wilberforce Kisamba-Mugerwa, Chair of Uganda’s National Planning Authority, reported that the HLPF is not sufficient for creating awareness of SCP, and urged involving sub-national leaders.

Edda Fernández Luiselli, Mexico’s Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources, said that in the Latin American and Caribbean region, sustainability must be promoted as a tool for competitiveness, not an environmental issue. She said that in LAC, the SDG implementors must be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which represent 80% of GDP.

Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, reported on efforts to link the existing ‘OneNYC’ plan with the SDGs, noting that after Hurricane Sandy, the City realized that prevention and protection must be equitable. She gave examples of New York’s waste management policies, such as ‘zero waste by 2030’, which includes bringing recycling to public housing and making public schools zero waste. She announced that New York City will present the first-ever ‘Voluntary Local Review’ at the 2018 session of the HLPF, and said it will map city-level efforts against the SDGs to enable discussions and exchanges with other cities and countries about best practices and filling gaps.

During the sessions on SCP and ocean action and plastic pollution in the ocean, Arthur Andambi, Permanent Mission of Kenya, said Kenya banned plastic bags in 2017. He announced that Kenya will host a blue economy conference from 26-28 November 2018, and noted that Kenya has proposed to host, along with Portugal, a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020.

Sian Sutherland, Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet, said the use of plastic for food and drink packaging represents a momentary use with consequences that last forever, and recommended that governments take action on this. Another participant noted that plastics play a key role in packaging innovations that reduce food waste.

Participants developed ideas for bringing together communities of practice around targets that are closely linked. Arden-Clarke suggested creating a working group on value chains, which could cover both food and plastics. He noted that the upcoming session of the Trade for Sustainable Development Forum will meet on the theme of sustainable value chains for SDG 12, and suggested that a working group on value chains could take advantage both of this event and the subsequent blue economy conference in Kenya.

Several presentations informed participants of the current status of plastic pollution in the ocean and efforts to address it. Speakers noted that plastic production is expected to double or triple within ten years, while the volume of additives in plastic and products’ complexity make recycling a limited solution. Participants observed that many consumers know about the problem, with one suggesting addressing the dynamic between consumer and retailer in order to “beat the speed of regulation.”

Recent actions taken to reduce plastic, as reported by the experts, include:

In the Maldives, schools have eliminated single-use plastics as of April 2018;

In the Netherlands, an affordable grocery store opened a plastic-free aisle;

The UK recently announced the Clean Oceans Alliance to reduce plastic waste in Commonwealth states;

In Switzerland, major supermarkets placed a five-cent fee for plastic bags, reducing demand by 80%.

Additional ideas were brainstormed, including:

Use extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies with regard to plastic packaging, as well as industrial fishing and the loss of gear;

Work with mineral water bottling companies to shift to other types of bottles, and hold a conference with the five largest bottled water companies in the world to secure commitments on going plastic-free;

Create legislation covering supermarkets’ responsibility, especially as some have said, “we would love to be legislated into” reducing plastic; and

Use blockchain technology to track ships, fishing nets and other aspects of fishing supply chains and manufacturing.

One participant said demand is only part of the solution, and legislation is required when producers and packagers are not ready to come to the table. A government representative said that despite regulations and laws, the petroleum industry can perpetuate a bad situation in a country through lobbying and investments.

On food loss and waste, experts including James Lomax, UN Environment, and Harry de Gorter, Cornell University, US, explained that in food and agriculture, unlike other areas of SCP, efficiency is not the problem. Calories are produced very cheaply already, which leads to consumption of the wrong food – non-diverse, high-calorie, and corn-based – in turn creating an obesity crisis. Moreover, when food is wasted, the water, energy and wildlife habitat used in creating the food are also wasted. However, decreasing production and consumption will increase prices. Redistribution of surplus is not the solution, Lomax stressed, and will only entrench the system of waste.

Participants stressed the need for consumer campaigns and public outreach, such as conducting food waste audits in schools. They also noted the importance of measurement and monitoring, such as through the food waste index led by UNEP and partners, and through initiatives to separate food waste from the waste stream.

On whether there is a business case to be made for reducing food waste, one participant said the westernization of diets is driving the crisis, and it is difficult to make a business case to address that. However, Richard Swannell, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), said businesses can experience a favorable rate of return on reducing food loss and waste in under two years, and companies that measure how much is wasted through the entire process of producing the food in the first place realize the need to reduce waste.

Regarding SDG 12’s status as the least funded SDG, participants suggesting linking food waste to other issues, highlighting that it is difficult to mobilize funding for what is perceived as a first-world problem. They also called for more measurement of gains from reducing food loss and waste, which will lead governments to invest.

The 2018 report also looks at how the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, respectively, are driving business strategy.

To generate the report, Ethical Corporation surveyed over 1,500 business professionals in a range of roles and sectors around the world, with 70% coming from Europe and North America. The survey identified how companies and business leaders are seeking to transform operations and outputs in order to deliver on the SDGs and Paris Agreement.

Among the findings, over two-thirds of corporate-brand respondents indicated that their company is integrating the SDGs into business strategy, which the authors note represents a significant and consistent increase in the two years since the Goals’ adoption in 2015. Of the remaining third of respondents, half indicated that they do not intend to do this in the future. Regionally, businesses in Europe and Asia-Pacific feature higher rates of integration than those in North America.

On the stage of SDG integration, 82% of respondents noted that they are currently in the mapping stage or integrating the Goals into business strategy. Only 12% claimed that the SDGs have been integrated across departments with clear goals set.

Despite this incomplete integration, the report finds that over half of respondents’ companies are using the SDGs as a framework to report on and communicate sustainability impacts. Thus, the authors underscore a risk of “SDG washing,” with companies using the SDGs as a communication tool “without much actual adaption to strategy or measurement of their impact towards the Goals.”

Indeed, 56% of respondents’ companies are not measuring their contributions to the SDGs. These findings are consistent with recent reports by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and KPMG.

On the primary SDG with which companies are engaging, the reports finds SDG 13 on climate action to be the clear leader across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America, with roughly two-thirds of companies in each region identifying SDG 13 as that which they engage in the most. The report also finds promising scope for climate action by US cities, states and corporations alike, highlighting the #WeAreStillIn movement as an important convergence of like-minded actors in response to the US announcement of its intention to withdraw the country from the Agreement. While respondents primarily see governments as being the most influential actors in ensuring that the Paris Agreement is met, over one-third felt that companies will be most influential. The report indicates that the vacuum of climate leadership from the US federal government has increased expectations and placed an onus on business leaders to carry climate objectives forward, as 68% of respondents report expecting their respective companies to “take a lead in helping meet the Paris Agreement.”

Similarly to previous years, responses show that there is still much progress to be made. In particular, businesses are struggling to measure the return on investment (ROI) of sustainability activities. However, 75% of respondents stated that “their CEO is convinced of the value of sustainability,” a slight increase from previous years.

The plan, known as the ‘Hoja de Ruta,’ identifies five priority areas for implementing the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and links each area to available partner and programme resources from across the NDC Partnership.

The priorities are: revising the country’s NDC; prioritizing mitigation and adaptation efforts; developing roadmaps for prioritized actions and signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) with partners; establishing a monitoring, reporting and evaluation system; and strengthening inter-institutional coordination for climate action.

To deliver on these priorities, the plan identifies 21 activities, to be implemented over the next three years, including: a comprehensive review of the country’s NDC; development of a national climate change investment plan; data collection and monitoring; capacity building; and increased public awareness. Annual review of the plan will seek to ensure inclusion of emerging priorities and reflection of progress.

Honduras is also developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support. The country has created institutional enablers for coordinated climate action, including the Presidential Office for Climate Change, climate change units within government institutions, and a multi-stakeholder national commission on climate change.

Honduras is developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support.

To highlight country experiences in developing Partnership Plans, the NDC Partnership hosted a side event on 8 May 2018 on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which convened from 30 April to 10 May. The side event titled, ‘Partnership Plan for NDC Implementation: Connecting the Dots,’ offered six member countries (Honduras, Jordan, Kenya, Mongolia, the Netherlands and Uganda) the opportunity to share their perspectives on and lessons learnt from Partnership Plans and NDC implementation. The event addressed such issues as gender in climate change action, working with global development partners, challenges faced when dealing with multiple government agencies, and the value and challenges of the Partnership Plan as a tool to implement and enhance ambition of NDCs.

Mongolia highlighted his country’s efforts to automate the Partnership Plan through an online portal, which will have an interactive interface to enable government representatives and development partners to update and share information on projects, initiatives and sustainable development priorities.

The Netherlands emphasized that the country engagement process contributes to improving donor coordination, transparency, and encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach.

Launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016, and hosted by the UNFCCC and the World Resources Institute (WRI), the NDC Partnership is a coalition of countries and institutions committed to advancing climate and development action. Partnership Plans are part of the NDC Partnership’s in-country engagement work, matching needs of countries with resources from other Partnership members through a government-led process that is flexible, supports transparency, enhances coordination among in-country and global actors, and mobilizes support for NDC implementation.

The VLR, to be presented during the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), will be modeled after the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs Penny Abeywardena made the announcement on 1 May 2018. According to the press release on the announcement, New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs, and its VLR will highlight the City’s achievements in sustainability since 2015. The VLR will be presented during the HLPF’s “sessions dedicated to local government engagement.”

The VLR, produced by the Global Vision | Urban Action programme of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs in close collaboration with relevant NYC agencies, compiles and presents existing New York City’s data and programs, the press release notes. An article by Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, indicates that the VLR will look at the City’s progress on a set of key SDGs, and will both reflect on successes and identify areas where New York can learn from others to address remaining challenges.

New York’s Global Vision | Urban Action programme shares innovations in sustainability with cities and countries around the world, “using the lens of the SDGs.” Established in December 2015 by the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, the programme seeks to, inter alia: engage with experts and representatives from New York City and the international community interested in achieving the SDGs; organize public events, expert meetings, and site visits to allow participants to see the SDGs in action and learn from each other about successes and challenges they face; and research links between New York City’s sustainable development work, the Mayor’s commitment to equity, and the SDGs. Hiniker reports that since the establishment of the programme, the City has hosted tours, panel discussions and other events to discuss how NYC is localizing the SDGs.

Global Vision | Urban Action also identifies links between the SDGs and the 2015 ‘One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City’ (OneNYC), the City’s roadmap on economic growth, sustainability, and resiliency. OneNYC commits to lift 800,000 New Yorkers out of poverty or near poverty by 2025, to expand access to nutritious and affordable food, and to fight against climate change and strengthen resilience, among other goals. As outlined in the document, ‘OneNYC 2018: Progress Report,’ which assesses New York City’s progress on the plan, New York’s accomplishments so far include: a “record job and wage growth” and a “record low unemployment,” with gains in all five boroughs; and the lowest poverty level since the Great Recession. The report also notes that New York is the first major city or state in the US to commit to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels, and the first city to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The OneNYC plan is available on the OneNYC website, along with its progress reports each year. The website also includes a list of indicators and initiatives related to the plan, and links to the NYC Open Data platform.

The HLPF will convene from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, on the theme, ‘Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ It will conduct in-depth reviews of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report reflects on Africa’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and makes recommendations for integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The report titled, ‘Integrating and Tracking Performance on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: From Theory to Practice,’ urges countries to consider the interlinkages among the two agendas’ goals, targets and indicators to ensure horizontal and vertical integration of initiatives into national development plans. In the report, horizontal coherence refers to coherence between a national development plan and a country’s international development commitments and initiatives. Vertical coherence relates to synergies among goals, targets and indicators, such as between the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. According to the report, levels of convergence between the two frameworks include 90% convergence at the Goal level, and 69% at the target level.

To support integration, the report presents the UNECA’s integrated planning and reporting toolkit, which aims to facilitate integration of multiple development frameworks into national development plans and to track implementation progress. The toolkit is intended for use by line ministries and others responsible for development planning at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as for civil society and the private sector to track progress.

Users can apply the toolkit to evaluate the extent to which their national development plans and sectoral plans align with external frameworks. The software asks the user to identify the national goal, target or indicator that best matches the corresponding variable of the 2030 Agenda or Agenda 2063. If the goal, target and indicator is an exact match, the alignment is classified as “full.” If the national variable is a proxy, the alignment is considered to be “partial.” Variables can also be defined as having “no alignment.”

The software also facilitates performance tracking on all indicators of a country’s integrated national development plan.

He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

LDN is the third target under the Sustainable Development Goal on life on land (SDG 15).

The LDN Country Profiles aim to provide policy-makers with easily accessible and scientifically sound information that can help estimate the value of investments in land restoration and inform on the economic returns of remedial action. The assessments highlight the multiple benefits of investing in sustainable land management (SLM), which is recognized as a key factor in accelerating SDG achievement, including for: Goal 1 (No poverty), Goal 2 (Zero hunger), Goal 5 (Promote gender equality), Goal 6 (Clean water and sanitation), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and Goal 13 (Climate action).

Asia and Africa bear the highest costs of land degradation, estimated at US$84 billion and $65 billion per year, respectively.

The profiles are largely based on analytical work undertaken by the Center for Development Research of the University of Bonn, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The analysis reveals that Asia and Africa bear the highest costs of land degradation, estimated at US$84 billion and $65 billion per year, respectively. Average losses resulting from land degradation for the 21 countries are estimated at nine percent of their gross domestic product (GDP). The UNCCD points out that this figure is even higher for some of the planet’s worst affected countries, such as the Central African Republic, where the total losses are estimated at “a staggering” 40 percent.

A total of 116 out of 169 countries affected by land degradation and/or drought have made commitments to set voluntary national targets under the UNCCD’s LDN Target-Setting Programme.

The Urban Breakfast in Guinea-Bissau focused on urban resilience, particularly in the context of political instability, poor planning and ineffective enforcement. The country faces rapid urbanization mainly through migration from rural areas to the capital, Bissau, which is located in a fragile coastal ecosystem threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl. Participants discussed planning resilient urban development in, and various urban planning options for, Bissau. Many supported a proposal for the development of a ministry-led UN-Habitat country programme.

In Praia, Cape Verde, a similar event discussed housing and sustainable urban development. Participants assessed progress regarding NUA implementation, and discussed preparation of Cape Verde’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) to be submitted to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2018. Speakers highlighted efforts to deal with the growth of slums, particularly on tourist islands. In addition, the event launched a participatory programme to improve informal settlements, which will run until 2022 with the participation of affected communities.

104,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/p4r-network-releases-comparative-analysis-of-2017-vnrs/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,P4R Network Releases Comparative Analysis of 2017 VNRs,"April 2018: In a “non-paper” analyzing the 43 Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) submitted to the 2017 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the transnational multi-stakeholder network Partners for Review (P4R) discusses institutional mechanisms for review processes, participation of non-state actors, and statistics and data for the SDGs. Per the paper, almost all the 43 VNRs outline the importance of communication and public awareness regarding the SDGs, and approximately 20 of them refer directly to communication strategies or campaigns targeting the general public.

Two independent consultants on behalf of the P4R secretariat produced the non-paper titled, ‘Comparative Analysis of 43 VNRs Submitted to the HLPF 2017.’ It assesses VNRs from the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.

The paper finds that VNR reports vary in many aspects, such as length, structure, and thematic coverage, and that references to national follow-up and review “come in many different shapes and sizes.” For instance, it notes that some VNRs use the term “follow-up” to describe implementation, while others use it as a heading to explain their next steps, and some interpret “review” as “reporting,” although both terms are used interchangeably, with an emphasis on monitoring progress. The paper outlines challenges related to the SDG process, including on: monitoring, evaluation and statistical capacity; general data availability and difficulty of compiling and using disaggregated data; alignment of national strategies and plans, and of institutions; and financing and resource mobilization.

The authors find that the main institutional mechanisms steering the overall SDG process are assigning the responsibility to a specific ministry, or to a cross-sectoral (and sometimes multi-stakeholder) committee or council. Per the report, 23 countries have assigned the lead for SDG implementation to a specific ministry or to the offices of the Presidency or the Prime Minister, and a smaller number of countries are building on pre-existing sustainable-development related councils, commissions or committees to coordinate SDG planning and review. The authors also note that 16 countries have “recently” established lead councils, commissions or committees to steer and coordinate implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and that the 2017 VNRs indicate “an increasing recognition” of sub-national level actors and institutions as key to successful SDG implementation, compared to 2016.

According to the paper, all 43 VNRs describe efforts to ensure participation of non-state actors (civil society, private sector and academia) in the SDG process, with some devoting entire chapters or annexes to individual stakeholder groups, describing their roles, the mechanisms of their involvement and/or their contributions to the implementation of specific SDGs. The two main approaches used for non-state actor involvement are representation in institutionalized committees, and participation in special consultations, the paper notes, but both are not mutually exclusive. It adds that while some countries engage in special projects or partnerships with the private sector, countries have established private-sector or academic advisory committees in very few cases.

On statistics and data, the 2017 VNRs show considerable variation, according to the P4R paper, with countries providing different levels and structures of disaggregated data, from “mere numerical presentation” to charts, graphs and verbal explanations, and with statistical annexes ranging from one to more than 100 pages. The paper also outlines few references to the use of non-official data, with 14 countries mentioning big or other “alternative” data. Six VNRs mention data contributed by civil-society and other stakeholders.

P4R is a transnational multi-stakeholder network composed of government representatives and stakeholders from civil society, the private sector and academia. Initiated “on behalf” of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, P4R facilitates dialogue and peer learning on SDG challenges, provides space to explore best practices and lessons learned, and shares expertise on new and emerging issues related to national monitoring and review processes.

The non-paper was prepared in advance of a P4R meeting that took place from 11-12 April 2018, in Tbilisi, Georgia. It adds to a series of reports consolidating and analyzing VNRs, such as the report ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the VNR Reports Submitted to the HLPF in 2017’ published by the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC), in collaboration with other civil society organizations. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has also issued synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs, as well as a compendium that synthesizes institutional arrangements adopted by the 64 countries that presented their VNRs during the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the HLPF.

105,https://cyclingmagazine.ca/mtb/sdg-tellis-dropper-post/,"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Canadian Cycling Magazine,First impressions: SDG Tellis dropper post,"When SDG made the decision to wade into the increasingly crowded dropper post market with it’s new Tellis post, the company didn’t want to just add another option without adding anything new. The company has been focused for decades on making saddles and grips, and didn’t need to make the move to dropper posts, but felt it had something new to offer.

SDG’s Tellis is designed to address four problems common to dropper posts: durability, simplicity, affordability, and lever feel. After two years of development and testing in Kamloops, B.C., the company is confident they have achieved their goals with the Tellis. “It is an affordable, easy to work on and above all else, a reliable dropper seat post,” the company says.

When it came to testing the Tellis, the Huntington Beach, Cali.-based company leaned heavily on SDG Global Sales Director, and Chief Tester Devyn Pelley, in Kamloops. Pelley set up a secret science shed with a reciprocating linear actuator motor to cycle the Tellis post for six months, as a complement to the lab testing in Taiwan. In a more traditional form of testing, Pelley also thrashed the Tellis on his local Kamloops trails, riding through -20 Celsius to make sure the post’s feather-light actuation would continue to work flawlessly through a Canadian winter.

SDG's science shed test set-up SDG bathed the Tellis in a slurry of grit and mud for the test process

Wanting to test more than cold weather functionality, Pelley developed a self-contained vat of muddy grit that encapsulated the seal around the shaft. The machine ran for months as in an effort to promote real world exposure to water, mud and debris. SDG reports the Tellis system remained clean and functioning even after countless hours of cycling through the muddy water.

SDG’s Tellis dropper post comes in 125 mm and 150 mm travel options, though 100 mm and 170 mm options will be added later in the summer, and is available in 30.9 mm and 31.6 mm seat post diameters. The internally routed post comes with a 2 year warranty.

First impressions: SDG Tellis dropper post

I’ve been testing the 150 mm version of the Tellis and so far it has lived up to all of SDG’s claims. The post feels solid, with no rotational movement, and the lever has a nice, light feel to it, as advertised. The Tellis was quick and very straightforward to install. Attaching post connect to the cable head, which makes installing the post in the frame simple. There’s little fiddling with cables and wrenches on the post side, as you try get the post into the frame.

From there, you just thread the end of the wire through SDG’s remote lever, and you’re on your way. The lever itself is equally simple and functional. The clamp can be attached without removing everything else off your bars, and its slim design doesn’t take up valuable cockpit space. A pinch bolt locks the cable in place, and a barrel adjuster allows for a small amount of fine tuning for the posts engagement point. True to its word, SDG has done the research and refinement to give the Tellis an incredibly light actuation feel and the lever paddle is easy to find and operate, which is appreciated when you come across an unexpected scenario and suddenly need your post out of the way.

The 3d forged head on the Tellis makes the overall post length shorter, which anyone with limited real estate in their frames seat tube will appreciate. It does mean tightening the seat clamp bolts requires a bit more dexterity with a wrench, but that is easily worth it for the shorter length and the post is still simple to install.

Two of the big claims SDG makes are that the Tellis is reliable and easily serviceable. Both hinge on the fully sealed cartridge system the post relies on for its travel. Reliability can only be tested over time, but the scratch resistant coating in on the posts lowers has held up to several tests already without signs of wear. Riding conditions have been better described as “deep dust” than “wet slop” lately on the wet coast, but that rarely lasts long. The Tellis will see rain and grit soon enough, and I’ll report back on long term reliability after a couple months of that.

Serviceability on the Tellis appears quite straightforward, and SDG has created handy YouTube videos for service and installation SDG has opted for the sealed cartridge system for exactly that reason. Part of the posts reasonable cost does come through the posts minimal available adjustments. There’s no return speed adjustments on the Tellis, which sends your seat up towards you at a quick, but not lightening fast rate. There’s also minimal positioning adjustments at the lever end. The narrow bar clamp means you have more space to move the lever inboard or outboard, and the svelte lever should give you room to rotate the lever. But most of the adjustments do come by physically moving the lever around on the bar.","When SDG made the decision to wade into the increasingly crowded dropper post market with it’s new Tellis post, the company didn’t want to just add another option without adding anything new.

106,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/inaugural-symposium-launches-global-campaign-to-tackle-soil-pollution/,"Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Inaugural Symposium Launches Global Campaign to Tackle Soil Pollution,"4 May 2018: The launch of a global campaign titled ‘Be the Solution to Soil Pollution’ is one of the main outcomes of the inaugural Global Symposium on Soil Pollution (GSOP18), which convened from 2-4 May 2018, at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) in Rome, Italy. Ahead of the meeting, FAO published a synthesis report of existing scientific research titled, ‘Soil Pollution: A Hidden Reality,’ warning that pollution poses a worrisome threat to agricultural productivity, food safety, and human health, but “far too little is known about the scale and severity of that threat.”

Around 500 soil experts, policy makers and other stakeholders attended the GSOP18, which was co-organized by FAO’s Global Soil Partnership (GSP) and Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS), UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment), the Secretariats of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS Conventions Secretariat), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Symposium aimed to contribute to implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by serving as a platform to assess the latest information on the status, trends, and actions on soil pollution.

Participants assessed the status of soil pollution worldwide and explored options for its prevention as well as remediation. Specific themes included: the impact of agricultural fields and other land uses; the impact of soil pollution on food production and safety, the environment and overall human well-being; remediation of polluted sites; and developing policies and setting thresholds for addressing soil pollution and the global status of soil pollution.

The FAO synthesis report found, inter alia, that: production of chemicals has grown rapidly in recent decades and is projected to increase annually by 3.4 percent until 2030; in 2015, the European chemical industry produced 319 million tons of chemicals, of which nearly half were deemed hazardous to the environment; and levels of persistent organic pollutants in human milk are significantly above those considered safe, with a higher incidence in India and in some European and African countries. The report also raised concern about a near-doubling of the amount of manure left on pasture, which can contain high amounts of heavy metals, pathogen organisms and antibiotics. Other sources of soil pollution highlighted in the report include approximately 110 million mines or other unexploded pieces of ordnance that are scattered across 64 countries on all continents, and high concentrations of radionuclides in “almost all soil in the northern hemisphere.”

Ongoing GSP initiatives to track the global status of soil pollution were highlighted, notably the 2015 Status of the World’s Soil Resources report, and the 2017 Global Assessment of the Impact of Plant Protection Products on Soil Functions and Soil Ecosystems, which is one of the follow up actions to the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management that were adopted by the GSP in 2016. The role of the BRS Conventions in coordinating the phase-out of persistent organic pollutants (POPs); production of global norms for sound environmental management; and fostering partnerships with stakeholders was highlighted. The meeting also discussed the implementation of the 2017 UN Environment Assembly Resolution on soil pollution.

Building on diverse national and regional case studies of soil pollution featured at the meeting, participants highlighted organic compounds and emerging contaminants as one of the main challenges. They called for a global assessment of soil pollution that includes modeling chemical production and emissions, prioritizes highly contaminated sites, and assesses, at country level, the main contaminants and impacts. The importance of developing accessible technologies to assess soil pollution was also emphasized.

During the closing session, the GSP Secretariat announced plans to establish two working groups to continue work on some of the key issues addressed at the Symposium. The two groups will focus, respectively, on developing guidelines for assessing, mapping, monitoring and reporting on soil pollution, and managing soil pollution. ITPS and its partners are developing an outcome document from the Symposium that will summarize the scientific evidence and data presented, as well as ideas for overcoming existing challenges and future steps, that will serve as a road map for the ‘Be the solution to soil pollution’ campaign and other future actions.

The GSP was established under FAO in 2012 as a mechanism to develop an interactive partnership and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders, to improve the governance of and promote sustainable soil management. The ITPS was established at the first GSP Plenary Assembly in 2013 and is composed of 27 top soil experts from all regions. Its main function is to provide scientific and technical advice on global soil issues to the GSP and to specific requests by global or regional institutions.

The Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management were adopted by the 4th GSP Plenary Assembly and endorsed by the 155th session of the FAO Council in 2016. They provide technical and policy recommendations on achieving sustainable soil management.

Launched during the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 30 April to 10 May, the report recalls that the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the UNFCCC resulted in, inter alia: almost US$1 billion in financial commitments to address climate change; the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue, which aims to inform and inspire Parties as they increase their commitments; the first-ever Gender Action Plan; a platform for indigenous peoples and local communities aimed at the exchange of knowledge, technologies and practices; and an agreement on agriculture.

The report discusses goals for the year ahead, including: increasing the number of ratifications of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol so it can enter into force; concluding the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue in the lead up to and during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland; and adopting the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) by the end of 2018 at COP 24.

The report acknowledges links between the Paris Agreement on climate change, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), whereby action in one area benefits the others, and, in the words of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, pursuing the three together “increase[s] impact and efficiency” and helps transform peoples’ lives and ensure a healthy planet.

The report highlights the Law and Climate Change Toolkit, piloted in 2017 to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

On increasing the ability of countries to report on emissions, UN Climate Change 2017 activities included: training programmes for review experts on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and on biennial reports (BRs) and national communications (NCs); a handbook for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV); and regional training sessions and expos to help national experts prepare and finance national adaptation plans (NAPs), and align them with the SDGs.

The report highlights that, in 2017, the Adaptation Committee shared good practice on accessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and provided advice to Parties through the adaptation finance bulletin. In addition, the Secretariat launched the following: the Adaptation Knowledge Portal, which includes information and knowledge resources on enhancing climate resilience; NAP Central, a hub of information on creating and implementing NAPs; and ‘The Adaptation Exchange’ Facebook page, which disseminates knowledge, engages stakeholders and provides learning opportunities. At COP 23, the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) launched the Fiji Clearing House for Risk Transfer to help Parties develop and implement risk management and connect with risk transfer experts.

The report also provides an overview of climate financing, including: the GCF, with 76 projects and programmes, amounting to US$3.7 billion in direct funding and US$8.9 billion in co-financing; the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$4.2 billion in direct funding and US$38.2 billion through co-financing for over 1,000 mitigation projects, and over US$8 billion mobilized for adaptation; and the Adaptation Fund, which, as of March 2018, had committed US$476 million for adaptation and resilience activities in 74 countries. The Secretariat and the regional collaboration centres (RCCs) initiated the Green Investment Catalyst Roundtable to mobilize private sector finance for implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

On technology, the report notes that the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) launched three publications, and organized two major events, namely an innovation and climate change event, and a thematic dialogue on industrial energy efficiency and material substitution. The publications include: ‘South-South Cooperation and Triangular Cooperation on Technologies for Adaptation in the Water and Agriculture Sectors’; ‘Technological Innovation for the Paris Agreement,’ which highlights ways in which innovation can accelerate NDC and NAP implementation; and ‘Industrial Energy and Material Efficiency,’ which recommends policies for scaling up use of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial sector.

On building new partnerships, the publication reports that the Secretariat used COP 23 to pilot an initiative to establish links with a range of stakeholders on innovative ways to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention. During Climate Week in New York in September 2017, the Marrakech Partnership launched the Climate Action Leadership Network. At COP 23, the inaugural Yearbook of Global Climate Action was launched, showcasing the results of the Marrakech Partnership.

On developing effective climate legislation, the report notes, the Secretariat, together with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, piloted the Law and Climate Change Toolkit to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

Also, the report highlights an Asia-Pacific Climate Action Agenda developed under the Nairobi Framework Partnership (NFP) to promote enhanced pre-2020 ambition and the employment of carbon pricing instruments and policies, and improve access to finance.

Where do we want to go? How do we get there?

The Talanoa Dialogue’s preparatory phase started in January 2018 and will last until December, to be followed by a political phase at the Katowice Climate Change Conference.

The Bonn Climate Change Conference comprises meetings of three bodies: the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 48), the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48) and the fifth part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-5).

Some of the main issues under negotiation in Bonn relate to the Paris Agreement’s cyclical and iterative nature.

The agendas of the three bodies cover a range of issues, including the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) and a set of decisions required to operationalize the Paris Agreement on climate change, on which the Bonn Climate Change Conference is expected to focus.

They include Parties updating their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) at five-year intervals, regular reports on progress under a transparency and accountability framework, and convening a global stocktake (GST) every five years to assess collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s goals.

Related discussions in the negotiations focus on, inter alia: information that could improve the clarity, transparency and understanding of NDCs; NDC features; accounting for NDCs; and the transparency framework for action and support, which includes reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and financial support provided to developing countries. Deliberations will also center on matters relating to the GST, common timeframes for NDCs, and modalities and procedures for the NDC registry.

Other PAWP themes to be discussed in Bonn include: the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement; accounting of financial resources provided and mobilized through public interventions; and recognizing developing countries’ adaptation efforts. Delegates will also consider adaptation communication, the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures, and cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which include market and non-market based approaches.

He was speaking at the end of last week as 32 staff members of the SDG Centre for Africa visited Ntarama Genocide Site in Bugesera District to understand the history of Genocide against the Tutsi and how it was executed.

Ntarama has particular history of genocide since thousands were killed here as they sought refuge at the former church.

“The Genocide against the Tutsi was the worst attack on human rights, the aspect which SDGs must consider if the world is to achieve sustainable development,” he said.

“Many people read about Genocide against the Tutsi in books and other channels and it becomes difficult for them to understand. They should come and visit such memorial sites to understand first-hand,” he said.

Begashaw said that visiting memorials, remembering and supporting Genocide survivors are necessary steps to honour the innocent souls that were killed.

For Rwanda to fully recover from such situation, true love and unity must prevail, he said.

“What has been achieved in Rwanda is very impressive since many countries under similar conditions take much longer time to recover. We, however, have more things to do to ensure a better future,” he said adding SDGs promotes well-being and human rights for people.

He said that tolerance helps to manage aftermath of hard times like genocide.

“SDGs are about building people and helping them to understand what happened, fighting genocide among many other human crises. We have no room for this and should not leave behind human rights. With hardwork, we will getter a better future,” he added.

111,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-solo,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Solo’,"Watching Disney’s Solo is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers.

In the 40-plus years since Star Wars took the box office and pop culture by storm, no plot point or line of dialogue, however essential or trivial, has avoided endless scrutiny and second-guessing from fans and skeptics alike.

How could the Death Star’s catastrophic vulnerability, so obvious that Rebel analysts spotted it immediately, have been overlooked by Imperial engineers? How could Han Solo boast that the Millennium Falcon “made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” when a parsec is a unit of distance, not time?

Watching Disney’s Rogue One and Solo, the two stand-alone “Star Wars Story” movies that come without episode numbers and opening crawls, is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers … as new leaks burst all around him.

Rogue One proposed that the Death Star’s weakness was secretly intentionally engineered by an Imperial saboteur. Yet, when the saboteur contacted the Rebels, he inexplicably didn’t simply tell them the vulnerability, potentially pre-empting the horrific battle for the plans and the whole plot of Star Wars. (That’s before we get to Darth Vader in Star Wars arguing, “If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?” when, following Rogue One, he should be saying “LOL, I literally chased you here from the scene of the crime.”)

Now, thanks to Solo, “making the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” finally makes sense. It’s just that, also thanks to Solo, it makes no sense for Han to cite this as evidence that the Falcon is a fast ship. Given Solo’s version of the Kessel Run affair, the Falcon could be the slowest hunk of junk in the galaxy and still do it in under 12 parsecs. Speed is literally irrelevant. Han’s curious boast is emptier than ever.

If it seems disproportionate to spend four or five paragraphs in this review basically addressing one line in another movie, consider that Solo spends possibly 45 minutes basically addressing the same line — and still makes a hash of it.

I will write this review in less than a day, for a paycheck that is less than 1/100th the cost of a single second of Solo’s running time. (With a reported $250 million budget, Solo is the most expensive Star Wars movie ever made. The average cost of each second of its 135-minute screen time is more than $38,000.) More people will watch Solo on opening day than will ever read this review. So, really, what’s disproportionate?

Co-written by veteran Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jonathan, directed with unswerving vanilla competence by Ron Howard (taking the reins after Lego Movie maestros Phil Lord and Christopher Miller lost a no-confidence vote with Disney brass), Solo isn’t terrible by any means.

We meet young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) as an orphaned delinquent surviving the mean streets of Corellia with his girlfriend Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke). In the course of time, each of them winds up in the company of interplanetary criminals. Han joins a gang of outlaws led by a cantankerous desperado named Beckett (Woody Harrelson), while Qi’ra becomes right-hand girl to the silky-voiced crime lord Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany).

Fans will be rewarded with decent accounts of how Han and Chewbacca first met and how Han won the Falcon fair and square from the flamboyant gambler Lando Calrissian, played with wit and charisma by a terrific Donald Glover. There are also answers to questions no one was asking, like where the surname “Solo” came from. (Turns out it’s not just an on-the-nose character name.)

If that last is a bit of a groaner, there’s nothing here like the wince-inducing dialogue or wooden acting of George Lucas’s prequel trilogy. On the other hand, there’s nothing like their visionary quality either.

It may be hard to recall, but there was a time when one of the main pleasures of a Star Wars movie, including the prequels, was being taken to places the likes of which no movie had ever taken us and seeing things we had never seen before.

From the seemingly endless underbelly of the Imperial Star Destroyer in Star Wars’ opening shot to The Empire Strikes Back’s chaotic 3-D obstacle-course chase sequence through an asteroid field, from the groundbreaking puppet work of Yoda and Jabba the Hutt to the breathtaking cityscapes of the Naboo capital and Courscant, Star Wars was always dazzling us with unprecedented visions and vistas.

Technological innovation was responsible for a lot of that visual novelty, of course, but poetic imagination was also part of the equation.

J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens at least offered a few memorably evocative images, like the immense hulk of a long-ruined Star Destroyer on the surface of Rey’s home planet. Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi had, among other things, that haunting silent sequence in which Laura Dern’s character singlehandedly took out the enemy flagship by ramming it at light speed.

Is there a single novel visual in Solo that lingers in the imagination?

Perhaps the sinuous, spine-like articulated monorail train wending its way around snowcapped mountains in the train robbery set piece — a Western-inspired sequence honoring Han’s gunslinger vibe — expands our visual horizons a bit. I’m at a loss to think of much else.

And even that train robbery sequence doesn’t have the visual impact it could have, partly because, like so much of the movie, it’s bleakly underlit and has a flat, washed-out look.

Where Revenge of the Sith was full of (what looked like) spectacular golden-hour late-afternoon cinematography, a lot of Solo is set in dull, hazy landscapes bereft of sunlight or shadows. For a film that’s supposed to be a sort of space Western, that’s an odd choice.

Solo is the first film in the new Disney franchise with a white male lead. Besides Qi’ra, there are two notable female characters: Beckett’s partner and significant other Val, played by Thandie Newton, and Lando’s robotic companion L3-37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge), a woke navigator droid whose bitterly sarcastic commentary on the subjugation of droids is an explicit extension of the implicit feminism and racial diversity of earlier installments.

Despite this lip service to diversity, Solo’s female characters fare poorly. Vague spoiler warning: One of them chooses a stupid, pointless fate in the service of an unnecessary plot point, accomplishing nothing in the process.

Another is scarcely better served, while the third makes a crucial choice that might be called empowering, but doesn’t seem to fit the character or to have the emotional impact it ought to have, especially in a film that wants to be a Han Solo origin story.

The thing is, Ehrenreich’s young Han is a far cry — too far — from the aloof Bogartesque cynic indelibly embodied by Harrison Ford through two of the first three Star Wars films. I can imagine young Han becoming colder and harder, but not becoming less empathic.

Our hero might be a slick operator and an outlaw, but he’s also a sensitive, compassionate guy. Per the astute observation of my friend Emily Snyder (of Patheos’ “Pop Feminist” blog), with whom I saw the film, it’s hard to imagine the Han whose only answer to Leia’s declaration of love was “I know” having a history of such emotional availability as we see in his relationship with Qi’ra.

On the other end of the spectrum (or at least another end) is Lando’s relationship with L3-37. L3 bluntly remarks that Lando has an unrequited romantic attraction to her. There’s even a vague exchange about how such a pairing would “work” (L3 indicates that it’s possible).

It would be one thing if it were an open question whether Lando’s feelings were real or a figment of L3’s overheated cybernetic imagination. But no, clearly his “love” is true. This is how Disney says “Love is love” in a Star Wars movie in 2018.

“Everybody needs someone,” says Val. Her interracial relationship with Beckett is a welcome Star Wars first, I think, given that Billy Dee Williams’ Lando got nowhere with Leia. If Leia were at all flattered by Lando’s admiration, she might have felt differently had she known just how undiscriminating his tastes could be.

It’s not a total waste of time. There’s a clever plot twist or two and some worthwhile creature design. Ehrenreich’s performance is engaging on its own terms, and the film takes a big leap forward when Glover shows up.

Is that enough? For a certain type of Star Wars fan, it may be. It has to be. This is what Star Wars is now — and what it will be for the foreseeable future.

It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

113,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unwto-report-links-sustainable-tourism-to-17-sdgs/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNWTO Report Links Sustainable Tourism to 17 SDGs,"6 June 2018: The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has published a two-volume report titled, ‘Tourism for Development,’ that makes recommendations on the ways in which tourism could contribute to sustainable development and the SDGs, and illustrates the global reach and positive effects of tourism on other sectors.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

114,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/netherlands-second-sdg-report-highlights-progress-on-goals-8-12-and-16/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Netherlands' Second SDG Report Highlights Progress on Goals 8, 12 and 16","1 June 2018: The Netherlands has released its second SDG report, which finds the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries in several areas of progress towards the Global Goals. In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs. [Publication: The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands] [Statistics Netherlands Press Release] [2017 VNR report]","1 June 2018: The Netherlands has released its second SDG report, which finds the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries in several areas of progress towards the Global Goals.

An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

116,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/vnr-2018-main-messages-available-for-45-countries/,"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,VNR 2018 Main Messages Available for 45 Countries,"18 June 2018: Of the 47 countries presenting their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July, 45 have made their report’s main messages available. Some of these countries presented their VNRs at previous HLPF sessions (Benin, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Switzerland, Togo and Uruguay), and are updating their progress on the SDGs.

The VNRs were called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate the sharing of national experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. The “main messages” provide a brief overview of more comprehensive review documents that are prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts during the HLPF.

By 7 June 2018, main messages were available for 35 countries, including all of the Eastern European Group (EEG) countries that will present at the 2018 HLPF. Between 8 and 18 June, 10 additional countries’ messages became available: Benin, Mali, Republic of Congo and Senegal; Bahrain, UAE and Viet Nam; Colombia and Ecuador; and Andorra.

African Group

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized. The prioritized SDGs are: SDG 2 on zero hunger, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 15 on life on land, and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

Per its summary, the Republic of Congo established a steering committee in charge of following-up on the SDGs, and is preparing an action plan for SDG implementation that should provide information on related costs for their implementation. It notes mobilizing funding for the effective and efficient operationalization of the SDGs as one of the main challenges facing the country.

Senegal’s messages note that the process of alignment between the SDGs and the ‘Plan for an Emerging Senegal’ (PES)– a policy framework to get Senegal onto the road to development in 2035 –was launched in January 2016 by the government. Its priority actions cover nearly 77% of the SDG targets. It also reports that “inclusive” mechanisms, such as an SDG monitoring platform for CSOs, were established, but that participation of some stakeholders such as the private sector, parliamentarians and local elected representatives, should be further strengthened.

Asia-Pacific Group

Bahrain’s messages state that the Government Plan of Action (GPA) is aligned with 78% of the SDGs, and the country’s Constitution and public policies guarantee universal access to basic services, and gender equality. The country reports that basic education is free and compulsory, healthcare is free and universal, and two committees instituted by the Supreme Council for Women ensure equal opportunities and gender responsive budgeting. It also indicates that: women hold 55% of supervisory positions, with 53% and 33% participation in the public and private sectors respectively; public and civil society-led programs extend to migrant workers to safeguard their rights, provide health insurance and shelter, and combat human trafficking; five new sustainable cities are being developed; and remittances of migrant workers in Bahrain amounted to approximately US$2.5 billion in 2017.

In its messages, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announces that the SDGs and sustainability will be a central focus of Expo 2020 Dubai, and its SDG National Committee serves as a platform for multi‐stakeholder engagement. The Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, is vice-chaired by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, and comprises 17 federal government organizations, according to the VNR messages.

On progress related to SDG implementation, the UAE indicates that the SDG National Committee has: prioritized targets “to pursue on an annual basis;” determined criteria for incorporating SDG targets into the national development agenda; assessed the scope of SDG implementation “given resource capacities and constraints in a particular year;” and developed a comprehensive communication strategy to engage societal stakeholders on the SDGs. The UAE also notes that: a Private‐Sector Advisory Council reports to the vice‐chair of the SDG National Committee; it has a Minister of State for Youth Affairs; it launched the Emirates Youth Council; and seven emirate‐wide Local Youth Councils are involved in official deliberations concerning SDG implementation.

Viet Nam states that the 17 SDGs have been nationalized into 115 Vietnamese SDG targets and in its national action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It adds that sustainable development principles have been mainstreamed into its 2011-2020 Social and Economic Development Strategy and its 2016-2020 Social and Economic Development Plan. The country’s key messages note that the Viet Nam Business Council for Sustainable Development aims to enable the business community to share and spread good practices, and to play an “important role” in realizing the SDGs.

Per the messages, Viet Nam has a number of policies aimed at promoting social equality to ensure that no one is left behind, and the country has achieved a number of SDG-related results. For instance, its national multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.9% in 2015 to less than 7% in 2017; 93.4% of households in 2016 had access to safe water, and 99% of Vietnamese households had access to electricity during the same year.

Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)

Colombia’s executive summary notes that in addition to the SDG initiatives it reported on in its 2016 VNR, it has developed a national strategy (CONPES 3918) to implement the goals. The strategy, it says, includes, inter alia: a monitoring process with national indicators and quantifiable targets; institutional responsibilities; a plan for strengthening statistical capacities; and a communication strategy seeking to promote alliances with non-governmental actors.

The summary indicates that the website www.ods.gov.co comprises updated information on the country’s progress towards the goals, and that a mapping of resources from different public domestic sources and their allocation to each SDG has been prepared as a starting point for the development of a financing strategy. It also reports that a joint initiative is being developed with the private sector where companies can provide information that will enable them to make their SDG support more visible, and dialogues took place in different parts of the country to highlight SDG challenges and successful experiences.

According to its main messages, Ecuador has developed SDG “Flagship Interventions,” and has established mechanisms for the alignment, monitoring and evaluation of its planning with the 2030 Agenda. Among the SDGs to be examined in depth at the HLPF 2018, the VNR messages report that: guaranteeing universal access to water (SDG 6) is a priority for the Ecuadorian government and the “Safe Water and Sanitation for All” strategy is being implemented; and various programmes have contributed to maintain more than 16% of the national territory under conservation or environmental management (SDG 15). The messages also note that the VNR’s preparation was based on contributions from the government, private sector, academia, civil society and local governments.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Andorra reports that each “action” submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval must be associated with the SDGs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aligned its annual master plan for international cooperation with the goals. Its VNR summary notes that the Andorran private and financial sectors have integrated the 2030 Agenda into their social responsibility strategies, and education for sustainable development is a key concept of the Andorran education system, which it says, also integrates in a transversal way, education for human rights and democratic citizenship. It stresses the need to strengthen the production of statistical data, adding that the government has approved it statistical plan 2018-2021.

On SDGs examined in the VNR, Andorra says that in addition to the six goals reviewed in depth at the 2018 HLPF, it has also included Goals 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action), which are of particular importance for the country. On the VNR preparation, the Andorra’s summary states that an inter-ministerial team was set up to draft the report, national bodies representing civil society were asked to participate in the drafting process, and an emphasis was placed on the collection of statistical data. It also reports on the launch of a public consultation on the Internet and on an awareness and information campaign on the VNR.

According to the 35 messages currently available online, most of these countries have put in place institutional arrangements to advance SDG implementation, and have outlined the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders.



VNR main messages provide a brief overview of more comprehensive document which is currently prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts. On 7 June 2018, main messages were available for countries from all five UN regional groups, as follows: six from the African Group; eight from the Asia-Pacific Group; eight from the Eastern European Group (EEG); six from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC); and six from the Western European and Others Group (WEOG). VNR main messages were also available for Palestine, a UN observer State.

Countries have taken various approaches to highlight their main messages: some mainly focus on the SDGs under review at the 2018 HLPF, while others take a broader approach by referring to the 17 SDGs as a whole. Two highlight that they are considering an 18th SDG, specific to the national context. Countries generally outline efforts to implement the SDGs at the national level, while a few report on implementation efforts at the sub-national level and on integrating the SDGs as part of their international development frameworks.

African Group

Cabo Verde’s messages note that equitable, universal and sustainable access to energy, and water and sanitation are among the greatest challenges for the country, and mention the municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans as an example of local multi-stakeholder SDG platform. Egypt says that ensuring sustainable water resource management is a high priority for the Government, and its national strategic plan ‘Vision 2030’ is in line with SDGs. Guinea announces that its government will organize a national symposium on Sustainable Development and Fragility in June 2018, and plans to produce a VNR report annually.

Niger’s messages indicate that: the country’s VNR focuses on the six SDGs under review at the HLPF, namely: SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible Consumption and Production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Niger also reports that: its National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth and its Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021 are consistent with the SDGs; and 43 SDG targets and 66 indicators are considered as a priority for the country.

Sudan says its VNR was supported by recommendations resulting from the National Dialogue Conference that took place in 2015-2016, its debt burden is unsustainable (SDG target 17.4), and the “continuing reluctance” to admit Sudan to the group of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) is “unjustifiable.” Togo notes that access to electricity increased from 22.5% in 2008 to 35.6% in 2016, and rural electrification went from 3% in 2008 to 6.3% in 2016. It identifies securing land, decentralization, the digitalization of the economy, national statistics, and the financing of its economy as major SDG challenges.

Asia-Pacific Group

Bhutan notes it is “well on track” to implement the SDGs, and plans to establish an “entrepreneurship ecosystem” to provide a platform to generate green jobs through the participation of corporate and private sectors. As “one of the poorest countries in the Pacific,” Kiribati indicates that it has a special SDG Task force as part of its Development Coordination Committee, and is integrating its Mid-Term Review of its Development Plan 2016-2019 with its VNR.

Messages from Lao People’s Democratic Republic say its VNR report focuses on all 17 SDGs, and it has adopted an additional Goal 18 on “Lives Safe from Unexploded Ordnance (UXO),” considering that it is “the most heavily bombed country” in terms of bombs dropped per capita. The messages also note that: Lao PDR was among the “earliest countries to localize the SDGs;” it has a National Steering Committee for SDGs implementation chaired by the Prime Minister that includes members from all concerned ministries and agencies; and nearly 60% of its Eighth National Social-Economic Development Plan indicators are linked to SDG indicators.

According to Lebanon’s messages, its National Committee to oversee the roll-out of the SDGs is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes representatives from all line ministries, civil society and private sector representative. The country also: established a parliamentary committee on the SDGs and a statistical task force; has organized three workshops related to SDGs; and held regional consultations with civil society, while temporarily hosting 1.5 million displaced from Syria. Qatar says it has aligned its National Development Strategy 2018-2022 with the SDGs, and reports that: 100% of its population benefits from safe drinking water services; solid waste generation fell from about 9.6 million tons in 2011 to 4.6 million tons in 2016; protected areas represent 29.8% of Qatar’s total area, which is “one of the highest rates in the world,” and the government intends to establish and operate a biodiversity database by the end of 2022.

Saudi Arabia’s messages note that its VNR highlights progress on the 17 SDGs, and key SDG priority areas include: continuing the alignment of state programs and strategies with global SDGs targets and indicators; strengthening the role of SDGs at the sub-national level; and enhancing monitoring and evaluation infrastructure on SDGs. Singapore reports that its Inter-Ministry Committee on SDGs has organized multi-stakeholder consultations to assess progress, and that it used international rankings and indices to get an independent perspective of its progress vis-à-vis other countries. Sri Lanka says increasing multi-stakeholder engagement for the 2030 Agenda has been a key objective of its VNR process, and mainstreaming the SDGs into institutional plans is its main strategy to achieve the Goals. It reports that: its National Budget 2018 focuses on a “Blue Green Economy;” 89.5% of its population has access to safe drinking water; and renewable sources account for 53% of total primary energy supply.

Eastern European Group (EEG)

All EEG countries that are volunteering to present their VNR at the 2018 HLPF have submitted their main messages. Albania reports that its parliament has unanimously approved a resolution confirming Albania’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda, and the country has prepared an SDG baseline report which indicates that 83% of the SDG targets are directly tied to specific components of its National Strategy for Development and Integration 2016-2020. Armenia says it has established a National SDG Innovation Lab, in addition to other structures such as the ‘SDG Nationalization Inter-agency Task Force,’ and data for indicators have been developed by the National Statistical Service to assess SDG progress.

Hungary stresses the importance of building the SDGs and targets on the principles of guaranteeing human rights, solidarity and global partnership. It reports that 75% of the global SDG indicators are available in the country, and that all line ministries and other stakeholders, including the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, the Office of the Ombudsman for Future Generations, youth and the business sector, contributed to its VNR.

Main messages from Latvia state that its VNR sets the baseline for all 17 SDGs, based on a mapping of the 169 SDG targets against its policies and plans, and the Cabinet of Ministers will decide on Latvia’s medium-term goals, indicators and targets within available funding limits. Lithuania reports that its VNR has been prepared by a group of experts that involved representatives of various ministries, NGOs and municipalities. It identifies, among other priorities, social inclusion and the promotion of eco-innovation and investment in new technologies. Poland says its VNR, prepared by ministries and other stakeholders through a “participatory approach,” includes a diagnosis, priorities, and key actions on SDGs.

Romania reports that it is in the process of reviewing its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) based on the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. A process of localizing the SDGs started in 2016, and has fed into both this VNR and its review of the NSDS. In its main messages, Slovakia expresses its commitment to implement the 2030 Agenda by integrating it into “all its public policies” at all levels, and outlines six national priorities that integrate the 17 SDGs: 1) education (SDGs 4, 8 and 10); transformation towards an environmentally sustainable and knowledge-based economy in the context of demographic change (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12); sustainability of settlements, regions and the countryside in the context of climate change (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13 and 15); social inclusion (SDGs 1, 2 and 10); rule of law, democracy and security (SDGs 5 and 16); and good health (SDGs 3 and 10).

Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)

Bahamas’ main messages report that youth unemployment rose to 30% in 2015, and that the government in collaboration with civil society and other stakeholders has created a pilot initiative for a traditionally marginalized region known as the “Over the Hill Community,” that focuses on social and economic empowerment, rejuvenation, smart and green technology and programmes on youth and the elderly. The Dominican Republic says work is underway to identify objectives and policy mixes that will boost synergies and accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda through reducing multidimensional poverty, more competitiveness and decent jobs, promoting sustainable production and consumption, making populations resilient to climate change and other risks, and achieving a strong and inclusive institutional framework at the State level.

Jamaica’s document notes that it has a national coordination mechanism for the 2030 Agenda, and there is a 91% alignment between both its Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs, but policy coherence and building capacity on policy integration need to be improved. It adds that it has a roadmap for SDGs implementation and 66 indicators to monitor the goals, and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica leads the process to establish a coordinated national statistical system.

Among its institutional arrangements for SDG implementation, Mexico’s messages outline its SDG Specialized Technical Committee for the SDGs, which coordinates the generating and monitoring of data. The messages also indicate that Mexico can follow up on 169 of the 232 global SDG indicators, and that it conducted an analysis of the contribution of federal budget programs to the SDG targets in 2017. At the sub-regional level, it reports that: by May 2018, 28 out of 32 Mexican states had SDG monitoring mechanisms in place; the federal government has developed a guide to incorporate the 2030 Agenda approach into state and municipal development plans; but capacity of sub-national governments need to be strengthened.

Paraguay says it has been working since 2016 to advance the alignment of the National Expenditure Budget with its national development plan ‘Paraguay 2030’ and the SDGs, and has created the Inter-institutional Coordination Commission for the implementation, follow-up and monitoring of the SDGs, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Related to the SDGs to be reviewed in depth at the HLPF, Uruguay reports that 95.2% of its population has access to safe water, and it is one of the most electrified countries in Latin America. It also indicates that work related to raising awareness on the SDGs was initiated in 2017.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Australia stresses the value of a “fair go,” calling for action on fairness, justice and equality of opportunity, and adding that the government has adopted an approach to the SDGs that gives policy responsibilities and priorities to the “relevant” agencies and levels of decision. Its 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, it says, highlights Australia’s responsibility to contribute to global efforts to reduce poverty, alleviate suffering and promote sustainable development.

Canada notes its commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs at home and abroad. It reports that: federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how their policies and programs are contributing to the SDGs and their targets; Canada’s 2018 Federal Budget allocated new funds to establish an SDG Unit to track Canada’s progress on the SDGs; the government will mainstream a gender-responsive perspective in the implementation of the SDGs; and it will launch a process to develop a national strategy on the 2030 Agenda through collaboration with all levels of government, Indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders.

Exiting a period of “prolonged economic crisis,” Greece says the country has endorsed eight national priorities for adapting the SDGs to national needs and circumstances, in line with the recent adoption of the National Growth Strategy, and it plans to implement a “whole-of-government” approach coordinated by an Inter-Ministerial Coordination Network, steered by the General Secretariat of the Government. It also plans to develop a National Implementation Plan for the SDGs in 2019, by engaging “all stakeholders at all stages,” and to involve actively the Hellenic Parliament in the overall SDG follow-up and review process.

Ireland says its VNR addresses the 17 SDGs at the national and global levels, it has mapped existing policies and programmes against each of the 169 SDG sub-targets, and a national stakeholder forum will have its inaugural meeting in June 2018. It notes that its SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 is a framework for SDG implementation, and announces that the government will publish a new White Paper on International Development in the second half of 2018 to further strengthen the alignment of Ireland’s aid programme with the SDGs.

Malta says the Sustainable Development Act adopted by the government in 2012 mandates the government to mainstream sustainable development in its policies, and the government plans to launch ‘Vision 2050,’ as a framework for the mainstreaming of sustainable development across all levels of government. On institutional arrangements, Spain indicates that a High Level Group on Inter-Ministerial Coordination, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, reports directly to the President of the Government on progress related to the 2030 Agenda’s implementation. It also notes that an Action Plan for the Implementation of 2030 Agenda assigns Ministerial responsibilities for each SDG, and the Autonomous Communities and local entities have been asked to localize the Agenda.

UN Observer State

Palestine reports that its Council of Ministers issued a decree establishing a national team headed by the Prime Minister’s Office and “composed of all relevant partners” to head SDG monitoring and implementation. It says its National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 includes 75 of the SDG targets, and it has adopted a set of principles to ensure the active participation of non-governmental actors in SDG implementation. Palestine proposes a 18th SDG on “Ending the occupation, and the consolidation of the independent State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” and states that “the continuation” of Israel’s occupation, and its “systematic and widespread violations of international law” is the biggest impediment for Palestine to achieve the SDGs.”

The HLPF will take place from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, and will consider the theme, ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’ VNRs will be presented during the Forum’s ministerial segment, from 16-18 July.

118,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-measuring-progress-towards-sustainable-cities-and-communities/,"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Measuring Progress towards Sustainable Cities and Communities,"This week’s brief focuses on knowledge products around SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which is one of six Goals being reviewed in depth at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

Improving the health and well-being for a worldwide population expected to swell to 8.5 billion people by 2030 is integral to each of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Pfizer Inc. will talk about its support of the SDGs in the second of 3BL Media’s new webcast series, “Aligning Business With the Global Goals,” July 26 at 2 p.m. ET. Attendance is free and open to corporate responsibility and sustainability professionals.

“Pfizer wears the SDGs on its sleeves, proudly wrapping its corporate headquarters with the Global Goals just blocks from the United Nations in New York,” Dave Armon, CMO of 3BL Media and moderator for the series. “We look forward to hearing how Pfizer has embraced the SDGs across the business, forging partnerships that have distributed millions of medicines and vaccines doses and committing to the worldwide elimination of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness.”

In September 2015, the UN officially introduced the SDGs to transform our world and “leave no one behind” by 2030. The goals were adopted by 193 nations, and the UN has called for broad-based support of the SDGs, including active involvement by the private sector.

Based in New York City, and reporting annual revenues of $52.5 billion, Pfizer uses the SDGs as a framework to communicate its work related to seven of the Global Goals – SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 5, Gender Equality; SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 9, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production; and SDG 17, Partnership for the Goals.

Presenting on “Aligning Business with the SDGs: Good Health and Well-Being With Pfizer,” will be Chris Gray, senior director, global institutions and public reporting, in Pfizer's Corporate Responsibility group.

120,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/unleash-is-a-movement-of-positivism/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: UNLEASH Is A Movement of Positivism,"The grand finale of the world’s largest Innovation Lab took place a few weeks back in Singapore. The 2018 UNLEASH SDG Innovation Lab brought together 1,000 youth from 108 countries for an 8-day intense programme designed to accelerate innovative solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

121,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-migrants-refugees-and-data/,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Migrants, Refugees and Data","With the struggles of migrants and refugees dominating news cycles, this SDG Knowledge Weekly brief collates knowledge pieces on the subject and brings earlier reports to the fore, to shed light on the issues anew.



The 2030 Agenda recognizes the positive contributions of migrants. In the declaration, heads of state and government commit to “cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights” (paragraph 29), which is similar to language used in SDG target 10.7. The SDG Knowledge Hub has covered the Global Compact on Migration (GCM) process, including the most recent round of negotiations, their outcomes, additional consultations and the Secretary-General’s report, ‘Making Migration Work for All.’ This policy brief highlights research and thought pieces behind the process and issues.

At the start of the calendar year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued a publication titled, ‘World Migration Report 2018.’ The ninth of its kind, this volume “demystifies” migration, noting in its forward the heightened importance of understanding migration’s complexities in today’s “post-truth” era. Using data through June 2017, the report outlines: global migration trends; regional development; the current migration governance structure; features of current news coverage of migration; and linkages between migration, social exclusion and other hardships faced.

IOM also issued a report titled, ‘Migration in the 2030 Agenda,’ which compiles papers linking migration to thematic challenges across the SDGs. The papers suggest ways to address migration as part of efforts to implement individual Goals. As highlighted by IOM, migration is included in SDG targets 4.b, 5.2, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7, 10.c, 16.2 and 17.18.

A pilot study by IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) represents an effort to illustrate how far migrants are left behind, using harmonized census data. It discusses the potential to use such data to further monitor progress towards the SDGs, disaggregated by migratory status. SDG target 17.18 calls to increase the availability of data disaggregated by migratory status (among income, gender, age and other characteristics).

IOM GMDAC also authored a bulletin on a tool to quantify displacement and mobility. It describes IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), which aims to enable decision-making and targeted assistance in times of crisis. The DTM tracked over 30 million individuals across 72 countries in 2017, and is continuously being expanded in partnership with actors from the private sector and academia, and has fed into other reports, including the Global Report on Internal Displacement noted below. The GMDAC’s ‘Data Bulletin’ series informs the GCM process, with support from the EU.

The GMDAC previously developed Migration Governance Indicators (MGI), which have been used as a basis for assessing “well-managed migration policies,” per SDG target 10.7. The indicators help governments review the extent to which their migration policies are comprehensive, identify gaps, and advance the dialogue on migration, particularly in the context of the SDGs and the GCM. The first MGI assessment report for 15 pilot countries was released in 2016; a second report reviewing a new set of countries is forthcoming.

Also on data, the Migration Data Portal offers a tool to visualize and analyze migratory flows by country or region, as well as examine important data points on migrants’ vulnerability, well-being and remittance payments and costs. The Portal also features information on migration policy and public opinion, which can also affect other indicators such as migrants’ well-being. A summary guide is available on Data Driven Journalism. The Portal’s blog offers additional support, including a post on how to improve data on missing migrants, given the urgent need to address the more than 27,000 migrant deaths and disappearances recorded since 2014.

These efforts to collect and manage migration data are not implemented alone. The Global Migration Group (GMG) and Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) released a flagship publication in November 2017 with the IOM, World Bank Group, Governments of Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, and the broader UN system. The report is divided into four parts: concepts and criteria on migration; reasons for migration; linkages between migration and development; and protection of migrants. Titled, ‘Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ the report aims to be the go-to guide for integrating migrant priorities, policies and data into national development plans and strategies. It synthesizes best practices and lessons learned across the 16 GMG members, highlighting data needs, sources and gaps, and calling for common measures that allow comparisons migration patterns across countries and regions.

The KNOMAD partnership publishes regularly on ‘Migration and Development,’ and released its 29th brief on the subject in April 2018. This brief focuses on migration and remittances, reviewing trends in remittance and migration flows and the topic of “transit migration” where migrants temporarily stay in a country other than their intended final destination. The brief describes reasons for transit migration (both push and pull factors), regional patterns, and transit migration’s impacts on individuals, families, and the three countries involved (origin, transit and destination). The brief also notes that a significant percentage of transit migration is facilitated by smugglers. A full list of KNOMAD publications is available here.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released a report that finds over 2.5 million migrants were smuggled worldwide in 2016. Titled ‘Global Study on Smuggling of Migrants,’ the publication describes major smuggling routes around the world, and quantifies the scope of the issue, estimating that smugglers are collectively paid over US$7 billion per year. It underscores that smugglers expose migrants to risks including violence, theft, exploitation, kidnapping and death.

June 20 marked World Refugee Day. Released one day prior, the UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) ‘Global Trends’ report examines forced displacement in 2017. It finds that over 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced as of the end of 2017, 16.2 million of them being displaced that year. More than half of displaced persons are children. Of these figures, the report notes that 40 million people are internally displaced, 25.4 million are refugees who have fled their home countries to escape conflict, and 3.1 million are asylum seekers.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released a publication titled, ‘Global Report on Internal Displacement.’ The report focuses on the global displacement landscape and regional overviews, progress in reducing internal displacement, and the need for better data. It flags displacement from natural disasters as a key driver within countries, noting the issue as “both a cause and consequence of insecurity and low or unequal economic and social development.” The report sees national sovereignty as an opportunity, calling for country-led strategies to account for internal displacement risk, build governance capacity and integrate the risk into existing mechanisms. Harjeet Singh, ActionAid International, flags the report’s coverage of climate migration in an op-ed on IPS News. Separately, IOM’s Environmental Migration Portal also serves as a platform to share knowledge on the migration-environment nexus.

In its discussion on the budget for 2021-2027, the EU is proposing a near-tripling of funds for migration, asylum and border management. The Center for Global Development reviews the proposal here. Stay tuned for more on the EU budget and aid in the coming weeks.

Efforts are building on internationally recognized principles and guidelines, and emphasize the benefits of transparency and traceability in garment value chains.

In conjunction with the 2018 European Development Days, which convened from 5-6 June, in Brussels, Belgium, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the European Commission (EC) hosted an event on transparency and traceability in garment value chains. The event titled, ‘Do you know where your clothes come from?’ discussed opportunities for ensuring a more sustainable clothing industry.

The UNECE-ITC-EC meeting was convened as part of an initiative led by UNECE and ITC to set up a multi-stakeholder platform and develop policy recommendations and traceability standards to guide the garment industry and contribute to SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The event addressed the many challenges to traceability and transparency, discussing for instance, fragmented production processes, and the prevalence of illegitimate subcontracting and undeclared informal work in garment supply chains. Participants gave the example of the numerous, up to 15 steps, such as yarn-making, weaving, and fabric-cutting, involved in the transformation of raw materials, like wool or cotton, into a finished garment. They noted how each step has its own environmental impacts as well as labor rights issues.

A UNECE press release points out that traceability can help companies identify opportunities for efficient and sustainable resource management, health risks, environmental impacts and labor rights. This, in turn, leads to increased transparency, making it possible to obtain accurate data and disclose it to consumers and the general public. In 2017, per the UNECE, one third of the 100 largest global fashion brands had traced and made publicly available their list of tier-one suppliers.

Preceding this event, in April, the UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (CEFACT) organized an event on ‘Traceability for Sustainable Value Chains: Textile and Leather Sector.’ It highlighted the need for a harmonized set of traceability standards in garment supply chains. A 2017 CEFACT publication titled ‘Textile4SDG12‘ provides recommendations on achieving these standards. The publication “identifies basic principles, possible solutions, and provides recommendations for an international framework initiative on transparency and traceability for sustainability patterns in the clothing sector, in support of SDG 12.”

In addition to these meetings, civil society-led campaigns are working to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards openness and accountability in the fashion industry. They include #whomademyclothes by Fashion Revolution and the Transparency Pledge initiated by the Clean Clothes Campaign, Human Rights Watch and the International Labor Rights Forum. The awareness raising initiatives seek to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards more company disclosure, leading, ultimately, to a minimum, common transparency standard.

The ‘2018 Pulse of the Fashion Industry’ report published in May further explores sustainability issues in the industry. The report “aims to give guidance to companies looking to start or find further advances toward more responsible ways of doing business, by sharing proven best practices and defining bigger and bolder steps the industry must take.” Another publication, ‘A New Textiles Economy,’ was produced by a coalition of fashion stakeholders and makes the case for creating a circular fashion industry that embodies the principles of sustainable production and consumption.

Many of these ideas and pathways towards greater sustainability in fashion – as highlighted in these campaigns, reports and meetings – build on internationally recognized principles and guidelines that define sustainability requirements for the sector. These include the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever. WHO announced that the number of new cases fell in April and May, meaning that the outbreak is no longer a national health emergency. [UN Press Release on Lassa Fever]

On 17 May, the UN marked the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) with a message urging an end to discrimination against LGBTI people. In conjunction with the Day, UNAIDS noted that men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the communities most affected by HIV. However, UN agencies report that more than 40% of countries criminalize same-sex relationships, effectively blocking gay and lesbian people from accessing healthcare and social services. UN Women, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UNAIDS are working with the Global Network of People Living with HIV to end HIV-related discrimination and epidemics of AIDS by 2030.

124,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-adopts-resolution-on-un-development-system-reform/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Adopts Resolution on UN Development System Reform,"31 May 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a resolution on the repositioning of the UN development system, in order to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By this decision, the functions of the Resident Coordinators (RCs) of the UN system in each country are separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said that, while the resolution is not seen by everyone as “the perfect document,” it represents a legitimate outcome of a multilateral process.

The consultation process on the resolution was co-facilitated by Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, and agreed on 7 May 2018 via silence procedure. The UNGA held a plenary meeting on 31 May 2018 to adopt the final draft text titled, ‘Repositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system’ (A/72/L.52).

The agreed text, inter alia: requests the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with the UN development system entities, to present an implementation plan for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system, including on the operationalization of its funding arrangements, to the UNGA before the end of the 72nd session; and endorses the transformation of the Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to assume managerial and oversight functions of the RC system under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary-General and under the ownership of the members of the ‘UN Sustainable Development Group,’ as a stand-alone coordination office within the Secretariat, reporting to the Chair of the Group (the Deputy-Secretary-General).

The funding arrangements for the new RC system are set out in a “hybrid solution” negotiated through the intergovernmental consultation process. UN Member States would provide the RC system with up to US$255 million annually, beginning in January 2019, through three sources: a 1% coordination levy on strictly earmarked, third-party, non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source; doubling the current UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Assembly following the adoption of the text. He announced that he will move immediately to put in place a transition team, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General, to implement Member States’ decisions. He noted that the reforms will enable the UN’s teams on the ground to better tailor their presence, skill sets and overall response to Member States’ priorities. In particular, the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) will better reflect country priorities and country needs, and the RCs will be impartial and empowered, with “development as their DNA.”

The Secretary-General emphasized that his preference would have been to fund the RC system through the regular UN budget, in order to ensure predictability, sustainability and ownership from all Member States. However, he noted, the hybrid funding solution put forward by the co-facilitators “is the best possible alternative.” He appealed to Member States for their immediate support so that the reforms starts to be implemented on 1 January 2019. Guterres added that the resolution represents the foundations to place sustainable development at the heart of the UN, and to advance the SDGs with poverty as the first goal.

A representative of the UN Secretariat explained that, in order to implement the provisions of the resolution, requirements amounting to approximately US$255 million would be needed on an annual basis, with the major portion of the requirements necessitating extrabudgetary resources. She expressed hope that front-loaded voluntary contributions will be received in 2018 to expedite the inception of the reinvigorated RC system as of 1 January 2019. She further added that the UN Secretariat’s share of the UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement pertaining to 2019 will be US$13-US$16 million.

In the ensuing discussion, India said the modalities for funding the proposals in the adopted text are “significantly different” than those contained in the Secretary-General’s initial funding proposals, ignoring the views and consensus of a large part of the UN membership on the need for predictable and sufficient resources for the proposed reforms. He added that the availability of resources remains unclear, and the proposed cost sharing for the RC system increases uncertainty. The US expressed the expectation that the reforms will reduce bureaucracy, improve performance, and increase flexibility for agencies to quickly respond to challenges.

The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Ethiopia for the African Group, stressed that the resolution “explicitly states” that the UNDAF should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national governments, through an open and inclusive dialogue between the host government and the UN development system, and in accordance with national development policies, tailored to priorities and the country needs. He cautioned that if the resolution is poorly implemented, the Group’s member states will bear the brunt of the costs, and this poses particular risks for the smallest and most vulnerable countries.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said the LDCs prefer no reductions in the country presence of the UN development system. The proposal of 50% common premises by 2021 should not incur any additional financial burden for LDCs, he added. He requested the UN Secretariat to ensure that the annual report on system-wide support to the UN development system provides disaggregated data and information on LDCs in every chapter, and has a separate section on LDCs highlighting the progress and challenges in these countries.

The EU noted that the agencies of the UN development system will be “in the driver’s seat.” Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), said the RC function is moving from being dependent on the infrastructure of a US$5 billion organization to that of an office that currently has a staff of 30. In this context, careful handling and maintenance of relationships is paramount, particularly during the transition period. CANZ added that the upcoming funding dialogue should be seized as an opportunity to explore how different types of partnerships can support the work of the UN development system and ensure an expanded funding base that moves beyond a small group of traditional donors.

Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) called for the reform to address multi-country offices (MCOs), and highlighted the need for dependable funding for small island states to implement it. CANZ welcomed the MCOs review.

Lajcak said the actions to be undertaken in the reforms to the UN development system cannot be considered in a vacuum, but the momentum needs to be brought forward into: the ECOSOC review and alignment process; the discussions on UN management reform and the UN’s peace and security pillar; as well as in Member States’ daily work.

The “repositioning” process began with an ECOSOC dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption, in December 2016, of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. The UN Secretary-General then delivered two mandated reports outlining proposals for reforms to the UN development system, in June and December 2017. These proposals were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings led by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, in January and February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” addressing questions raised by Member States during the briefings.

The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during ECOSOC’s Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), in February and March 2018. Petersen and Boukadoum then guided Member States in a six-week consultation process to agree on the resolution.

She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

But, increasingly, he's trying to lead the way on global sustainability issues, too.

That's because he believes he has a personal role to play in improving the planet, the ""Black Panther"" star told CNBC Make It.

It all started with a phone call from the United Nations in 2006. Whitaker had just wrapped filming ""The Last King of Scotland"" and was helping a friend volunteer with child soldiers in Uganda when the international peace organization got in touch to find out more.

""The UN saw what I was doing and asked if I would come in and talk about what was going on,"" said Whitaker.

The project had not been on the UN's radar, he said, nor on the agenda of local government. So, he decided he had to do more himself.

The actor set about extending his charity work, and, in 2012, set up the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative, a non-governmental organization designed to help communities torn apart by violence in Africa and North America. In 2015, in recognition of his work, Whitaker was named as an advocate for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — 17 targets aimed at tackling global challenges such as poverty and climate change by 2030.

""When the UN Secretary-General appointed me as SDG advocate, it was very clear for me that this agenda was different from previous ones,"" Whitaker told audiences at Temasek Ecosperity 2018, a sustainability conference in Singapore in June.

""It did not presume that governments and international organizations are going to do everything and substitute themselves for people and communities.""","You're used to seeing Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker take the lead on the big screen.

128,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/fifth-committee-considers-un-management-reform-proposals/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Fifth Committee Considers UN Management Reform Proposals,"31 May 2018: The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) began its consideration of the UN Secretary-General’s proposals on decentralizing management structures at UN Headquarters. Delegates called for enhancing transparency and accountability, streamlining processes and reducing bureaucracy within the UN system.



Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, UN Secretary‑General’s Chef de Cabinet, presented the proposals that were previously conveyed to Member States in March 2018 in a report titled, ‘Shifting the management paradigm in the UN: implementing a new management architecture for improved effectiveness and strengthened accountability.’ UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres presented the report in a meeting with Member States on 22 May.

Viotti said the reforms aim to move the UN from a centralized to decentralized Secretariat, and from a bureaucracy focused on process to an institution focused on results. She said the overhaul will involve segregating policy from operations to allow the Secretariat to constantly assess and improve the effectiveness of policies and administrative support functions. Another proposal, on moving to an integrated supply chain management approach, she said, will ensure that missions and field offices receive goods and services at the right time. She noted that the Secretary-General also has advanced proposals for better policies in support of managers with regards to procurement and human resource management, as the current structures are particularly slow and cumbersome.

The proposals would create several new features and management functions from within existing resources, including:

a Uniformed Capabilities Support Division that will serve as a “one‑stop shop” for troop- and police‑contributing countries for administrative and logistical issues;

a Support Partnerships Service focused on situations where the UN provides support to non‑UN entities, particularly African peace support operations;

a new Business Transformation and Accountability Division focused on performance, monitoring, self‑evaluation and compliance functions;

a Management Client Board;

a Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance; and

a Department of Operational Support, focused on surge support to entities in weak environments.

Viotti explained that creating the latter two proposed departments will require “a great deal of change” in the subsequent six months, with close to 70 posts for the new departments needing to be reprofiled, advertised and filled. She said the Secretary-General will need to find a solution for the staff who will be affected, which entails determining if those staff members could be retrained, moved laterally or would prefer to take a buy‑out package. She further noted that staff guidance and training will be undertaken in the coming months.

Some departments will be integrated, she added, noting that health‑care management and occupational health and safety, currently split across three departments, will be consolidated into a single division. The administrative law, and conduct and discipline functions also will be brought together. The global information technology functions will be consolidated into one office.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, Chairman of the UN Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), said ACABQ largely recommends approval of the concept and design of the new structures proposed by the Secretary‑General. He recommended that the Secretary‑General be asked to consider consolidating under a single administrative structure the proposed Office of Human Resources in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the proposed Human Resources Services Division in the Office of Support Operations of the Department of Operational Support.

On delegation of authority and accountability issues, he said the Committee considers that the UNGA should be provided with further details, including on progress made towards establishing well‑defined roles and responsibilities.

In the ensuing discussion, governments expressed support for the envisioned management reform. Supported by Angola for the African Group, Brazil and Pakistan, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed the need to ensure equitable geographical representation and gender parity at all levels, and called for increased access to UN procurement opportunities for developing countries. The African Group requested information on how the proposals will impact offices away from UN Headquarters.

Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ) and with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the US, underlined that structural changes must be supported by cultural changes, including in leadership and accountability. Singapore, for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said ASEAN will pay particular attention to the role of oversight bodies in the proposed new structures. China said internal risk control must be strengthened.

Mexico noted that the implementation of the management reform proposals should not include requests for further financing. He asked how and according to what timetable will Member States be able to examine and evaluate progress and make relevant adjustments.

Cuba said Member States’ commitment to reform must move beyond words into actions and, to that end, Member States should pay their assessed contributions in a timely fashion. She noted that simplifying procedures and ensuring commensurate decentralization of decision‑making processes must go hand in hand with the strengthening of planning tools and systems of accountability. She further called for making senior managers accountable for poor performance.

Russia stressed that Member States must maintain “real leverage” over UN human and financial resources. She recommended the Secretariat prepare further information on the nexus between that reform and ongoing reforms, in particular the deployment of Umoja.

Japan proposed that the Secretariat make programme performance information available to the public and Member States through dashboards.

The report titled, ‘Investing in the Green Economy: Busting Common Myths,’ aims to help investors to better understand their interactions with the green economy.

It also seeks to assist investors in developing investment strategies by measuring, in a quantifiable manner, the transition towards sustainability.

The report identifies a large investment opportunity in the green economy, backed by global efforts to combat climate change and broader environmental challenges. The green economy, according to the report, aims to achieve sustainable development without degrading the environment, and be efficient, clean, circular, collaborative and low carbon. Thus, it concludes, the green economy is critical for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The report finds that the green economy represents 6% of the global stock market, or around US$4 trillion, coming from clean energy, energy efficiency, water, waste and pollution services. It notes that it could increase to 10% of global market value by 2030, assuming approximately US$90 trillion in green investments by that time. The report also determines that, over the last five years, green companies generated higher returns than the broader stock market.

The green economy could increase to 10% of global market value by 2030, assuming approximately US$90 trillion in green investments.

According to the study, the green economy is diversified by: company size, with large companies representing two thirds of green market capitalization; sector, including industrials (the largest), followed by utilities, technology, chemicals, and construction and materials; and geography, with the US, Japan, Europe and China leading the pack. The report finds that around 3,000 globally listed companies are exposed to the green economy.

The publication analyzes a range of products and services from different sectors in renewable and alternative energy, energy efficiency, water, and waste and pollution, based on their impact on climate change mitigation and adaptation, water, resource use, pollution, and agricultural efficiency.

According to the report, the energy industry makes up more than half of the green economy, with food, agriculture, water and transport also being important. It explains that high-tech and renewables also have major roles to play, specifically through the cloud computing technology, which can help companies reduce carbon emissions by up to 90%.

The report also highlights the rapidly growing use of solar and hydroelectric power, and resources such as lithium for batteries, and organic foods or seeds that boost agricultural yields as critical to the green economy.

SINGAPORE — It’s day two of the annual Sustainable Development Goals innovation lab UNLEASH, and the six innovators from across the globe making up team “Shanka” seem confident with the progress they’ve made on how to boost social and emotional learning for children. But by early next morning, the bravado has seeped out and tired eyes look up from a table littered with hastily scribbled ideas. Just days away from pitching their final idea to a panel of experts, they have more questions than answers.

“We talked until late last night. We’re still in problem framing,” says team member Najmuzzaman Mohammad, chief product officer for a Bangalore-based network of impact funds.

Mohammad is one of 1,000 young people from 109 countries who participated in the annual innovation lab that began May 31. The carefully selected millennial thought leaders gathered in classrooms and halls at various university campuses across Singapore, aiming to address some of the biggest global problems. In just five days, 170 teams of former strangers worked to define their own unique problem related to the SDGs — and come up with a viable solution.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively.” — Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group

Working under a time crunch and governed by a precise methodology, participants in self-directed groups presented their progress to facilitators to pass through “gates” to the next stage of innovation. It’s a unique model, not only because it brings young talents together from around the world, but also because the ultimate goal is not necessarily the ideas or products pitched on the final day of the event.

Moving forward, participants will have access to an online platform to stay connected with each other, as well as with the expertise and financial muscle of corporations, think tanks, foundations, nonprofits, and angel investors. UNLEASH partner Deloitte has also promised seed funding and pro bono services to three to five of the solutions developed in Singapore. But the lab is less about the pitch, and more about investing in a movement — one that will generate 13,000 UNLEASH innovators by the time the lab finishes its final year in 2030.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively,” said Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group, who helped develop the UNLEASH idea and garnered support from about 250 partner organizations to make it happen.

The process

On Sunday, the “Water Lead” team — a group of five women scientists and engineers from four continents — is back at square one after spending eight hours “thinking too big,” explained Jen Loudon, a wastewater laboratory technician from the United States.

“We took three steps back … but we’re about to take five forward,” her Australian teammate Lisa Walpole told Devex.

To create an environment for innovation and spur creativity in just one week, the event in Singapore was highly curated. In fact, “a lot of this is actually down to minute plans,” Skovby said of the structured schedule that details activities from the moment talents arrive until their departure.

As a result, “there's very limited chance of this not succeeding,” he said in terms of participants having a positive experience and walking away with an understanding of the innovation methodology. “If there is something that doesn't work on the logistical side for you, it takes away focus. So everything we can do, we do.”

To start, UNLEASH flies 1,000 talents — chosen from a competitive pool of 7,500 applicants — from all over the world to a new city every year and puts them up for a week. The event costs about $4 million, without factoring in in-kind contributions. Covering all costs ensures the diversity in income and education level of its participants, which the lab considers its most fundamental aspect and biggest draw.

The innovation process is broken up into five stages, managed by facilitators from partners such as Dalberg, Deloitte, the United Nations Development Programme and expert consultants in this year’s eight focus areas: Zero hunger, education, health, water, energy, cities and communities, responsible supply chains, and climate action. A thick deck of activity cards prompts participants through problem framing, ideation, prototyping, testing, and implementing.

Every day, the teams must present their progress to a lead facilitator in order to move to the next stage of innovation. It isn’t easy, and many of the teams at UNLEASH will revisit problem framing multiple times throughout the process — while some might not graduate to ideation at all. The Water Lead team tried and failed to pass their gate on day three, but the exercise and ensuing conversation with facilitators prompted them to think differently about the issue they’d chosen to tackle: Lead-contaminated water and ensuing health concerns due to unregulated mining in Nigeria.

“I hate exercises in futility, but I think actually without going through everything we went through yesterday, we wouldn’t be able to narrow it down to what could work versus what just isn’t feasible at all,” Loudon said.

Nigerian teammate Adesinerola Adio-Adepoju, who brought the problem of lead contamination in her country to the table, described the process as a roller coaster, and a lesson in patience: “It’s almost like UNLEASH did this intentionally,” she told Devex. “They want you to get to that point where you boil over, just so you get all the bad energy out of your system so you come back to cool. We boiled over last night, and now we are cooling off, it’s good.”

The personal

On day five, Team Shanka’s Mohammad is tired, but optimistic. The group set the activity cards aside, he said, and spent a night sharing experiences from their own childhoods to spark ideas about what it takes to teach empathy and compassion at a young age.

“We actually developed a passion for it after we shared a story and realized, ‘this is something that we really need to work on because this has affected each of us.’”

Working with a team of six people sharing insights from six different countries is challenging, but it also provides more confidence that they’ve identified a strong problem to solve, he added.

Every year will see changes to the UNLEASH model as the secretariat responds to participant feedback. This year included a bigger focus on personality and team building, explained Murrayl Berner, UNLEASH 2018 innovation lab lead.

“This is an incredibly passionate set of individuals, and they're amazing and wonderful and talented in their own right — and they're also human,” Berner said. “So, you show up at something like this, you're incredibly jet lagged, you're out of your element.”

On day one, talents were prompted to identify whether they were a “thinker,” “sayer,” “doer,” or “feeler,” as well as to write down their motivating reason for participating. Equipped with this insight, along with talents’ professional backgrounds, facilitators then created diverse groups within each SDG topic area. It has become UNLEASH tradition that the ideation of team names and team charters happens long before any SDG solutions.

This year also gave the talents a chance to escape their own thematic area and chat about each other’s solutions in an idea marketplace in downtown Singapore: “Again, it's not about one team, it's about everybody, about the process and the connections and the learning,” Berner said.

Team Shanka’s socioemotional learning app for parents didn’t win them a chance to pitch in the finals, although it will be featured in the UNLEASH Solutions Catalogue, along with all the of the ideas that came out of the lab this year.

Mohammad sees room for improvement in the innovation methodology, which he felt was too broad, with activity cards prompting far more than can be accomplished in five days. He suggested UNLEASH bring in more veteran entrepreneurs to weigh in on the process design. And according to Skovby, it sounds like that will be part of UNLEASH’s future. Already, several talents who participated in Denmark flew to Singapore to act as facilitators, and 2019 will see the addition of an advanced track for entrepreneurs who have already developed a product that needs acceleration.

“It will be for you guys,” Skovby told the audience of talents at the final pitch competition, where eight teams — ranging from a social media-based sex education program to a system of nets that can help reduce farmers’ food waste — walked away with the title of top innovation of the week. “For people who have done good stuff throughout the year, we will invite again to come to UNLEASH.”

On Tuesday’s pitch day, the Water Lead team shared their solution of a simple, low-cost water treatment system for removal of heavy metals in rural Nigeria’s water supply. They didn’t advance to the final “Dragon’s Den” pitch competition, where the top spot for water went to a team that designed a safe latrine solution for a slum in South Africa.

Still, Adio-Adepoju got what she wanted out of the week, she told Devex: “I didn’t come here with a solution, I came here with a problem. I don’t have all the answers, but with young professionals in these many different fields, chances are you will talk to somebody who can provide feedback or a different insight. I feel like this is my United Nations.”

The report provides an overview of campaigns and events that took place during 2017, with a focus on sustainable tourism and the SDGs.

The report highlights three SDG targets that mention sustainable tourism, namely: target 8.9, on devising and implementing, by 2030, policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products; target 12.b, on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and target 14.7, on increasing the economic benefits of small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

Among the numerous SDGs-related events highlighted in the publication is the 22nd UNWTO General Assembly, which convened in September 2017 in Chengdu, China. The meeting focused on tourism’s contribution to the SDGs, and adopted the Chengdu Declaration on Tourism and the SDGs. The Declaration states that tourism is vital for achieving the SDGs as it can, inter alia, stimulate economic growth, create jobs, combat poverty, enhance livelihoods, empower women and youth, and preserve terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The Declaration proposes that countries: undertake national assessments on tourism’s contribution and commitment to the SDGs; ensure tourism is included in inter-ministerial SDG commissions and/or working groups; and establish frameworks and mechanisms that enable participation of all stakeholders to enhance the contribution of tourism to national SDG strategies.

The second UNWTO/UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Tourism and Culture, which convened in December 2017 in Muscat, Oman, focused on fostering sustainable development. The conference adopted the Muscat Declaration, which calls for, inter alia: advancing the contribution of cultural tourism to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs; encouraging an innovative approach for sustainable urban development through cultural tourism; and exploring links between culture and nature in sustainable tourism.

UNWTO’s ‘Travel.Enjoy.Respect.’ campaign aims to increase awareness of the role of travelers in harnessing tourism’s contribution to sustainable development.

Photo by: Cia Pak / U.N. / CC BY-NC-ND

CANBERRA — For much of the past year, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been carrying out a rigorous assessment into how businesses, government departments, civil society organizations, and more have been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. That voluntary national review, the nation’s first, looks at how SDGs are woven into all sectors — as well as the challenges faced in assessing them.

In the report launched in Sydney on June 15, Australia chose a case-study style of reporting with snapshots into activities across the 17 goals. The aim is to demonstrate both that the SDGs are a core part of government policy and services delivery, and that there is wide external support to help make the goals a success.

Australia’s SDG implementation strategy

The SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

According to the review, Australia’s approach to SDG implementation is to identify key areas of activity appropriate to Australia’s “national circumstances.” At the federal level, policy requirements will be determined by priorities delegated to government agencies or other levels of government.

Progressing the SDGs: What are the barriers and solutions to national implementation? At Australia's second Sustainable Development Goals Summit, held in Melbourne on March 13, participants highlighted a number of barriers to implementing the SDGs on a national scale, in a country that considers the goals more linked to the Millennium Development Goals than to domestic politics.

It is nearing three years since the SDGs were adopted in September 2015, yet the review finds that Australia is still engaging domestically to identify policies and programs that are contributing to the outcome of the goals.

During the report launch, Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop identified four goals of particular importance to Australia: Gender equality; inclusive and sustainable economic growth; ocean conservation; and peace and governance — goals 5, 8, 14, and 16 respectively.

“There is a very strong alignment between the SDGs and Australia,” Bishop said. “What is important, though, is that we all work in partnership, government, business, civil society, private sector, the public sector. This is an effort for us all.”

Three hundred and twelve government and nongovernment agencies were consulted for the review. Key stakeholders engaged to provide feedback for the VNR included the Australian Council for International Development, Global Compact Network Australia, United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, U.N. Association of Australia, People with Disability Australia, National Congress of Australia’s First People and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Nongovernment sectors including universities, businesses, and civil society are expected to contribute to the goals in building public awareness, as well as progressing the implementation of the SDGs “beyond ‘business as usual’ to make a real impact.”

Australia’s strengths, the report suggests, lie in innovation, technical capability, and its willingness to share knowledge with the world. Building upon this, DFAT hopes they can reduce inequality within Australia and globally.

Investigating interlinkages

Due to the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, it is important to look at how the goals connect and where associations can be made for greater impact. Through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s work, Australia is applying this approach in their SDG implementation.

“CSIRO’s work has shown that taking such an approach, identifying both positive and negative interactions, could help us achieve global outcomes at a significantly lower cost through thoughtful coordination of otherwise fragmented action,” the report reads. “Likewise, identifying trade-offs ahead of time could enable conflicts among objectives to be managed before they become institutionalised.”

Through this work, Australia is hoping to demonstrate that the SDGs can act as a “tool” for organizations to identify and mitigate risk and opportunities outside of their core business or functions. This will allow the SDGs to move from government-supported action to whole-of-Australia supported action.

Equally, by encouraging collaboration between organizations, Australia hopes to create stronger interlinkages between the goals.

“For example, the South Australian Government’s Health in All Policies initiative takes a ‘joined-up’ policy development approach to achieve better public policy outcomes and simultaneously improve population health and wellbeing,” the report says. “Such an approach is based on the understanding that health is not just the product of health care activities, but is influenced by a wide range of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants of health.”

What about data?

SDGs show slow progress, not on track to reach 2030 targets, UN reports Conflict and climate change drove at some of the most significant setbacks documented in the 2018 SDGs report, such as a rise in global hunger rates.

Clearly missing from the report is data demonstrating where Australia lies in relation to progress against each goal, with targets that would determine what demonstrates success domestically as well as through its foreign aid program. But the report does lay out Australia’s data strategy for the SDGs.

According to the report, Australia will need “relevant, quality and timely statistics” that provide evidence for national decision-making and policy.

“We have made concerted efforts to identify relevant, pre-existing data sets that match or closely align to the SDG Indicators,” the report says. “In line with the UN Statistical Commission guidance, Australia has approached the issue of data analysis, identification and reporting from the perspective that countries will approach the indicator framework in line with their own national priorities and capabilities.”

In identifying relevant indicators for the SDG, the Australian Bureau of Statistics undertook a data mapping exercise to identify government-held data sources that could be used as an SDG indicator. But this is not a straightforward process.

“Like other countries, Australia has challenges in identifying datasets,” the report says.

Identifying data custodians and developing a single point of truth where there are multiple custodians are important. Australia is still trying to determine data collection and analysis methodology for a number of SDG indicators that have no current accepted methodology for collection.

Domestically, Australia is working to develop an SDG data platform to make relevant government datasets on SDG indicators available and will indicate the status of Australian data collection against all 232 SDG indicators — a portal expected to be updated based on available data and information, and not a static snapshot from a point in time.

Across time, it is expected this platform will help to identify progress, becoming an SDG reporting platform to support future VNRs.

Australia’s data strategy also takes into account support for neighboring countries through the foreign aid program to enhance their ability to collect, interpret, and analyze data that will help them in determining in-country needs and progress.

Case studies to illustrate Australia’s implementation approach

For many of the case studies used in the report, SDG linkage occurs as an afterthought.

To highlight Australia’s work to support goal 15 on forest management, the report uses the Australian Business and Biodiversity Initiative, an cross-sectoral alliance of organizations promoting the mainstreaming of biodiversity into business practices and decision-making.

But the initiative was established in 2014, before the adoption of the SDGs, and therefore the linkage to the goals tenuous.

Yet the format does help to demonstrate how the SDGs are at the core of “business-as-usual” operations in Australia, as well as the diverse role individuals and organizations outside government can play in their implementation.

Highlighting the work of Plan Australia in developing Free to Be, an interactive online map to help girls and women identify safe spaces in large cities, shows that addressing social challenges is important to Australia — and encouraging these ideas and initiatives will lead to greater change that can be seen by 2030.

The response

On the whole, the VNR has been largely applauded by Australia’s NGOs, that see it as a milestone in SDG implementation. But they also see the challenges it poses — both in Australia’s policy and reporting style.

For ACFID Chief Executive Officer Marc Purcell, the report highlights the challenges Australia faces in addressing health, economic, and social issues faced by Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The environmental challenges are also great, with the Great Barrier Reef under threat from climate change and policies enabling maritime pollution. And poverty continues to grow.

Still according to Purcell, the nature of the case study report showed the value of early adopters’ work, but also showed that examples were “few and far between.”

“To have any realistic chance of achieving the goals by 2030, Australia needs to rapidly transform the way it’s working and put sustainability at its heart,” he said. “We should not be imposing the burden of our failure to act on the next generation. The time for talking has passed, now is the time for action on the SDGs.”

Australia’s VNR will officially be presented to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development at the U.N. in New York, on July 17, by Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific.","Australia’s SDG implementation strategyThe SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.
According to the review, Australia’s approach to SDG implementation is to identify key areas of activity appropriate to Australia’s “national circumstances.” At the federal level, policy requirements will be determined by priorities delegated to government agencies or other levels of government.
Through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s work, Australia is applying this approach in their SDG implementation.
According to the report, Australia will need “relevant, quality and timely statistics” that provide evidence for national decision-making and policy.

Underscoring that the current climate commitments are not sufficient to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5ºC above preindustrial levels, the statement calls on the G7 countries to take action consistent with their respective responsibilities and capabilities, including to fulfill existing pledges for climate action and support in the pre-2020 period, stating that many developing countries are “already committing to actions exceeding their fair share of the effort.”

The statement emphasizes the role of finance as “key to enabling an effective global response to climate change,” calling on the G7 to honor their commitments to increase finance, technology and capacity support, including in relation to the US$100 billion pledged to be mobilized annually by 2020, and to thoroughly examine how to enhance the transparency, reliability and predictability of such support.

The LDC Group statement calls on the G7 to “step up” with a “concrete plan to protect people and the planet.”

On national climate plans submitted to the UNFCCC, the LDC Group statement calls for the G7 countries to put forward more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that are in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and realizing the SDGs.

The LDC Group statement calls on the G7 to “step up” with a “concrete plan to protect people and the planet,” pointing to increasing loss and damage from climate impacts being faced by LDCs as a result of severe weather events which are affecting economic development, food security, health and migration.

On the G7 Presidency’s priorities, the statement welcomes the focus on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment, emphasizing the important role of women, youth, indigenous peoples and local communities in catalyzing climate action.

Looking towards the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC and the finalization of the Paris Agreement implementation guidelines, the LDCs’ statement highlights the need for progress throughout 2018 to achieve ambitious outcomes by the end of the year. It urges the “G7 and other countries that are not shouldering their fair share of the international climate effort” to enhance their commitments, underscoring that these should be informed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15) and the Talanoa Dialogue.

It's also a decent weight, an attractive as well as functional design, well constructed and reasonably priced to boot(y).

Pros: Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made

Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made Cons: The minimal padding might feel a bit too firm for some

The cutout isn't overly large compared to my previous saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow (which Lara tested in 2015), but it is well positioned and I found it does a great job of relieving pressure – absolutely crucial to a saddle's comfort. The Allure tips the scales at a respectable 268g (claimed 260g), just a shade more than the Diva.

> Find your nearest dealer here

SDG says this female-specific saddle is designed for all riding disciplines, and I found it performs well both on and off road. It is relatively narrow, at 143mm, and is only available in this one width; this, combined with the cutaway side profile, allows unrestricted leg movement, aiding pedalling efficiency. I actually prefer this narrowness to the 152mm-wide Diva.

It is quite long too, at 265mm, with a slim down-curved nose. This gives you plenty of room to shift your weight forward for climbing, while the seat's flat shape makes it easy to move around.

Construction

The low-profile Allure is made from high-quality materials and is well put together. It sports a lightweight nylon fibre base and LPU foam padding – although some might find the padding a bit too minimal. Compared to the more generously upholstered Diva Gel Flow, it has a very firm feel and it did take me a few rides for my behind to adapt to it. The Allure's wings are not as flexible as the Diva's either, although this didn't pose any problem, particularly because of its narrower width. Having spent several long days in the saddle, I can vouch for its comfort.

The Allure comes in two models: with titanium-alloy rails, tested here, or chromoly rails. The Ti-alloy version, as well as saving weight, is a little more forgiving because the titanium offers slightly more flex than chromoly, and helps absorb road vibrations. You pay for the privilege, though, as the chromoly model retails around £20 less, but then it weighs about 50g more.

Price-wise it compares well with others we've tested on road.cc. A lighter but similar sounding firm-rather-than-armchair option that Sarah got on well with is Fizik's Luce S-Alloy, at 250g and £86.99, and Tass liked the Specialized Ruby Expert, rrp £115 and weight 256g. But you can pay less: I really liked the £49.99 Fabric Scoop Gel saddle; no cutout but lots of comfort and not that much heavier at 273g.

> Buyer's Guide: 9 of the best women's saddles

Ultimately, I found the Allure very comfortable, and I'm impressed by its durability – the synthetic cover hasn't scuffed in a few months of riding, and it's easy to wipe clean. I also like that it doesn't look 'girly' and it comes in a veritable rainbow of colours so you can coordinate it with your bike.

Verdict

A firmer feel than some, but ultimately comfortable for long day rides and for off-road use too

139,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-first-reformed,"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘First Reformed’,"‘Diary of a Country Priest’ meets ‘Taxi Driver’ in Paul Schrader’s brilliant, disturbing film starring Ethan Hawke as a troubled pastor trying to serve a seemingly distant God in an indifferent world.

Q. Why did God make you?

A. God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in the next. (Baltimore Catechism)

Q. What is thy only comfort in life and in death?

A. That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Savior Jesus Christ. (Heidelberg Catechism)

For countless Catholics of a certain age, whether practicing or lapsed, the first question and answer above, instilled in them in CCD classes or parochial school, are as much a part of them as their own names, or more so. For Paul Schrader, as for me, my father and his father before him, the second question and answer have similarly deep roots.

First Reformed is not the first Schrader film to quote these opening lines of the Calvinist Heidelberg Catechism. They also appear in his 1979 film Hardcore, which is largely set in Los Angeles, but is 100% about the Dutch Reformed mecca of Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Schrader grew up, and where my father, a Dutch Reformed pastor in my youth, went to college and seminary.

In Hardcore, George C. Scott tried to explain the TULIP acrostic for Calvinism’s “Five Points” to an amiably baffled sex worker. Forty years on, First Reformed finds its protagonist, Ethan Hawke’s Rev. Toller, facing a world in which his theological tradition seems if anything even more incomprehensible. The words of the catechesis of his youth will always be with Toller, as with Schrader, but what comfort or assurance do such words offer today?

Toller’s post — a small Dutch Colonial clapboard church in upper New York state, built by 18th-century Dutch emigrants — is significant historically, but scarcely in any other way.

Toller guides more tourists on weekdays than congregants Sunday morning, explaining the church’s ties to the Underground Railroad, pointing out historic graves in the church cemetery and selling souvenirs in the gift shop.

The church’s upcoming 250th anniversary is a big deal. The celebratory “reconsecration service” (less euphemistically, a kind of last hurrah) will be packed with dignitaries, most of whom have never darkened the church’s door and will never return. A metaphorical shot of Toller laboriously raising a toppled headstone encapsulates his function at First Reformed Church: He is propping up a monument.

It would be easy, if premature, to view this hollow shell of a church as representative of U.S. or Western Christendom. Actually, Christianity is alive and well, after a fashion, at nearby Abundant Life — a megachurch that resembles (as megachurches are wont to do) a mashup of mall and convention center, which might suggest a different sort of a hollow shell.

Well-funded and efficient, Abundant Life is bustling with programs and activity. (A subtle physical exchange between a boy and a girl in a small choir practicing “Are You Washed in the Blood?” is typical of Schrader’s attention to the disconnects below the surface in conservative communities.)

Loose change from the megachurch’s cushioned pews could just about cover First Reformed Church’s operating budget; in fact, it more or less does.

A placard in front of the smaller church gives it away: First Reformed is now “An Abundant Life Historical Church.” Toller’s paychecks are signed by the genial, well-connected Pastor Jeffers (Cedric Kyles, aka Cedric the Entertainer), and Jeffers’ wealthy donors cover the church’s expenses.

If that’s not mortifying enough, Toller knows that his job is partly a lifeline thrown to him by Jeffers in the wake of the breakup of his marriage following the death of his son in Iraq. Then a military chaplain, Toller had encouraged his son to volunteer. He now views Iraq as an unjustified war, and U.S. foreign policy may not be the only area in which he has lost faith.

In this humbled condition, Toller strives as best he can for what remains to him: authenticity. He belongs to a particular tradition, but he immerses himself in the likes of Thomas Merton, Soren Kierkegaard and medieval Christian mysticism (his reading material includes a copy of the anonymous 14-century work The Cloud of Unknowing).

At an Abundant Life small group, when a participant struggles with the hard reality of good Christians leading lives that are not so abundant, Toller tries to offer a dose a biblical realism regarding prosperity theology (though he’s shouted down by an indignant Jesus bro who’s tired of feeling bad for the less fortunate, or something).

Toller’s life is a daily existential crisis resonating with the struggles of other fictional men of the cloth, often Catholic, trying to serve a seemingly remote God in a world seemingly indifferent to what they have to offer.

Brendan Gleeson’s formidable rural Irish priest in Calvary is a recent example. Other notable precedents include the protagonists of Graham Greene’s The Power and the Glory, Luis Buñuel’s Nazarín, and, most relevantly, Robert Bresson’s Diary of a Country Priest, based on the novel by Georges Bernanos.

Schrader’s seminal study Transcendental Style in Film, published when he was just 26, explored what he argued were spiritually evocative techniques associated with select filmmakers, including Bresson. Schrader’s own interests as a filmmaker, though, have generally run in other directions.

In First Reformed, Schrader makes greater use than ever before of what he calls the “transcendental toolkit” — but it’s still very much a film from the writer of Taxi Driver. If Toller partly evokes Bresson’s wan, saintly curé, in time we see that he’s also part Travis Bickle, which can be as difficult to watch as it sounds.

Actually, Bickle himself was already indebted to Bresson’s curé: Among other things, all three characters keep journals which they update in voiceover. They also share troubling stomach ailments, an incarnational manifestation of a spiritual “sickness unto death.”

But where Bresson leads us through his protagonist’s dark night of the soul to the triumph of grace, as First Reformed unfolds it begins to look as if fallen nature might have the last word, at least for now.

The arena for this showdown of nature and grace is established in a pivotal conversation between Toller and a depressed young environmentalist radical named Michael (Philip Ettinger).

Though wholly secular, Michael respects Toller (in gratifying contrast to his opinion of the team at Abundant Life, which seems “more like a company” to him). Their meeting is arranged by Michael’s concerned wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried), who is pregnant with a child Michael can’t see bringing into so troubled a world.

This dialogue brings together two of the most contentious causes célèbres of the right and the left: abortion and environmental concerns.

In the best line from their exchange, Toller tells Michael that the trauma of taking life outweighs any trauma of suffering it to come into the world. Yet for Michael the threat of looming environmental catastrophe isn’t merely the most important thing, it’s literally the only thing that matters.

Michael's dilemma mirrors one that troubles many dedicated pro-life activists: How does one live day after day in a shadow of so vast a crisis without succumbing either to complacency or numb despair on the one hand or to madness and fanaticism on the other?

The tension between Michael’s despairing environmental apocalypticism and the life of the child in Mary’s womb persists throughout the film, though the pro-life theme remains implicit while the environmental theme in all its urgency and destructive potential becomes the dominant concern.

“You’re always in the Garden,” Jeffers chides Toller (meaning, of course, Gethsemane), in a pastoral conversation not unlike the one Toller’s doctor tries to have with him. “Even Jesus wasn’t always in the Garden.”

It is humiliation upon humiliation that this glib, shallow man of God may be right about Toller’s increasingly worrisome behavior.

Worse, Toller himself, no less than Jeffers, is in the pocket of a local fat-cat businessman (Michael Gaston) whose oil company has an abysmal environmental record. The word of God is not fettered, St. Paul wrote from prison, but Toller finds there are topics he may not be allowed to discuss. Even a private memorial service held far from any church comes under scrutiny. (I have never seen a scattering of ashes scene so deliberately depressingly and unpoetically shot.)

In the last act Schrader unexpectedly changes cinematic gears, and even genres, with a surreal sequence borrowing directly from a film with similar eschatological concerns, Andrei Tarkovsky’s The Sacrifice.

It’s effective as homage, though what works organically in The Sacrifice doesn’t work the same way here (I think; I might need a second viewing to be sure). Certainly it sets up the mad finale, which is as harrowing as the The Sacrifice’s famous climactic shot, and as ambiguous.

In the end, like The Sacrifice, First Reformed seems to me somehow unresolved. Hope and despair struggle to the end, but the despair is anchored in crushing realities, while the hope is nebulous and chimeral. All the urgency of Pope Francis’ eco-encyclical Laudato Si is here, but too little of its humanism, and very little hint of its redemptive vision.

“Will God forgive us?” is the question to which First Reformed returns again and again. The first time it comes up, Toller’s response is, “Who can know the mind of God?” These are both vital questions, and neither is as simple as it may seem, but the second question is a poor response to the first.

First Reformed depicts a religious culture, like the biosphere, in crisis, perhaps sickness unto death. But it is not a rejection of the former, any more than the latter. For one thing, Michael’s secular despair is hardly more attractive than Toller’s tormented faith.

Nor does the film simply despair of mankind or embrace nihilism. Mary, the film’s most sympathetic character, and for Toller (and probably for Schrader) an icon of goodness, wants her baby. This is a sign of hope, not only that the world should go on, but that human beings should be part of it.

First Reformed can hardly imagine a hopeful future for the world, because it seems human beings can’t or won’t change. The world is broken; human beings are broken; religion is broken.

Yet the film is full of longing for redemption: for healing of wounds, forgiveness of sins, and, in some unguessable way, vindication of faith. Toller hopes that his journal is a kind of prayer. Perhaps Schrader hopes the same for his film.

Caveat Spectator (spoiler warning): Some gory and disturbing images and themes including bloody aftermath of a suicide and a terrorism theme; references to a sexual affair and an intimate, not exactly sexual physical encounter; brief rude humor. Mature viewing.

140,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/where-are-we-in-achieving-sdg-15/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?,"Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.
For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households.
Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection.
“TO DO” for SDG 15Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline.
Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important."

The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SOFO 2018 analyzes the importance of forests and trees in conserving biodiversity (SDG 15), tackling climate change (SDG 13), improving urban habitats (SDG 11), providing safe drinking water (SDG 6), supporting food security (SDG 2), reducing inequalities (SDG 10) and ending poverty (SDG 1), among other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva explained that SOFO 2018 provides “greater evidence on how forests are critical to livelihoods of the world’s poorest,” including a better understanding of the trade-offs and “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SDG 15 (life on land) includes several indicators that focus on forests. The report finds positive change globally on three indicators: proportion of forest area located in legally established protected areas; proportion of forest area under long-term forest management plans; and forest area under independently verified forest management certification schemes. The report shows no/small change globally on two indicators: forest area net change rate; and aboveground stock in forest. The report illustrates regional variation in all five indicators, with Eastern and Western Asia and Australia and New Zealand showing positive progress across all five SDG indicators.

The report further underscores the significant income generated from non-wood forest products (NWFPs), stressing that the real figure is likely much higher than global estimates of US$88 billion. For example, one in five people globally depend on NWFPs for food, nutritional diversity and income. In Europe, one in four people collects food, such as fruit and berries, directly from forests. In Uganda, the non-cash value of forest products is up to two to four times higher for local people than the cash value.

On the governance of forests, the report further documents the importance of clear legal frameworks on forest tenure rights, and commends growing trends in local governance, with national governments devolving forestry rights to local and community-based tenure. SOFO 2018 underscores the importance of strengthened legal frameworks in securing the rights of local communities and smallholders to access forests and trees, contributing to ending poverty and achieving sustainability.

SOFO 2018 highlights several positive trends, such as increasing awareness on forest preservation and increasing sustainable forest practices. For example, 56% of paper is recycled today, compared to less than 25% in 1970. The report also showcases a global increase in forest areas managed for soil and water conservation over the past 25 years. Populations in Vienna, Austria; Bogota, Columbia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Tokyo, Japan rely on protected forests for drinking water, and in the US, 180 million people rely on forests for their drinking water.

The report will be presented and discussed at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which is taking place in New York, US, from 9-18 July 2018. SDG 15 is one of the goals to be discussed during the HLPF’s “in-depth review.” [FAO Press Release] [UN Press Release] [Publication: 2018 The State of the World’s Forests]","The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

This week’s knowledge brief looks at issues at the forefront of participants’ minds, including reports that address countries’ progress in light of the VNRs, tackle systemic challenges such as data collection and leaving no one behind, and evaluate opportunities to make progress in the private sector.

Daily ENB coverage of the HLPF is available here, and coverage of selected side events is here. All HLPF-related content on the SDG Knowledge Hub can be found here. For a selection of reports and articles on the individual SDGs that were reviewed, see SDG Knowledge Weekly: High-level Political Forum, Part 1.

Country Reviews and Civil Society Spotlight Reports

As 46 countries discussed their VNRs (a summary of main messages is here), civil society organizations were present to hold governments to account. Civil society organizations were also active throughout the Forum to share their own findings in the margins of official VNR presentations.

Numerous civil society reports, also known as “spotlight reports,” have been released to provide another assessment of countries’ progress than what governments present during the VNR sessions. As UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed noted during the Partnership Exchange on 13 July, these reports can serve to confirm, strengthen or sometimes even refute official VNRs. Also on 13 July, a side event titled ‘SDG Implementation at National Level: What’s the Point of National Reports?’ shared knowledge across civil society actors, and discussed whether spotlight reports lead to changes. An IISD Reporting Services summary of the event is available here.

AwazCDS-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Development Alliance, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Pakistan and UK Aid, released a report titled, ‘Where Pakistan Stands on the Implementation of the SDGs 2018.’

The British Columbia Council for International Cooperation (BCCIC) authored a publication titled, ‘Where Canada Stands, Vol. II, 2018: A Sustainable Development Goals Shadow Report’

Platform Agenda 2030 released a report titled, ‘How Sustainable is Switzerland: Implementing the 2030 Agenda from a Civil Society Perspective.’

UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) launched the report, ‘Measuring up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’

Coalition 2030 released a report evaluating Ireland’s progress on each SDG. The report notes that the country’s National Implementation Plan for the SDGs 2018-2020 is a first step, but progress has been slow and that more action is needed. A press release is also available.

Additional releases on the Action for Sustainable Development platform respond to the official VNRs for Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Mexico, Palestine, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Sudan.

In addition to these country-specific reports, a civil society report titled, ‘Spotlight on Sustainable Development 2018: Exploring new policy pathways,’ reviews “how to overcome obstacles and contradictions in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda,” also looking at cross-cutting policy ideas and individual SDG “spotlights.” It is published by the Arab NGO Network for Development (ANND), the Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR), Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), Global Policy Forum (GPF), Public Services International (PSI), Social Watch, Society for International Development (SID), and Third World Network (TWN), supported by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. The authors note that the world is off-track on delivering the policy changes needed to enable SDG achievement.

The authors of the Spotlight Report 2018, also provide 18 national reports. A corresponding post by Jens Martens, Global Policy Forum, stresses that implementation issues and countries’ being “off-track” is not due to a lack of financial resources, but rather the need to ensure policy coherence and reduce contradictions. Martens also highlights military spending and improving regulations for sustainability and human rights as key areas to address.

Additionally, a middle ground of sorts seemed to emerge in reporting: the Government of Germany invited an independent, international peer review of the country’s 2016 sustainable development strategy, which delivered its insights at a side event on 12 July.

Another actor with a potential voice in reviewing SDG progress is each country’s parliament. Together 2030 and partners released a civil society handbook for engaging parliaments in support of the SDGs, opening with an explanation of parliaments’ relevance to SDG implementation. The document features engagement strategies to approach private meetings, run SDG trainings and launch public campaigns, identifying entry points into parliamentary activities and noting which strategies are most valued by members of parliament themselves.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) also led an initiative to bolster the official VNR sessions, by convening a series of “VNR Labs” during the HLPF ministerial meeting. The Labs aimed to take stock of countries’ experiences with the reviews to date, and to provide an informal space for dialogue focused on key themes, including leveraging interlinkages, leaving no one behind, data, and mobilizing resources, among other topics.

Data and Ensuring that No One is Left Behind

With SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals) under review each year, a number of reports and initiatives continued to be developed around data, analyzing interlinkages across the SDGs, and evaluating progress towards key principles that underpin the 2030 Agenda, such as leaving no one behind.

Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched their 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards Report. Assessing where each country stands in terms of SDG progress, this iteration of the index and dashboard also ranks countries based on their aggregate performance, incorporating trend data for the first time. Sweden, Denmark and Finland stand atop the ranking, but the authors note that several indicator and methodology changes mean that this year’s findings are not comparable to those of 2017. Overall, the report finds that conflicts have reversed progress in many parts of the world, and that no country is on track to meet all SDGs. A Q&A with SDSN Director Jeffrey Sachs is available on Devex.

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) highlighted its Arab Development Portal, developed in partnership with the Coordination Group of Arab, National and Regional Development Institutions (CG), the Islamic Development Bank and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) to track progress on SDGs in the region. Initially launched in 2016, the Portal, UNDP notes, is now available to everyone. Additionally, UNDP and the RISE Institutes of Sweden launched the ‘SDG Trend Scanner,’ which provides “an opportunity to understand key disruptive trends” through an SDG lens. It also creates a platform to compare different trends and trend assessments, as well as identify trends that feature “low probability, high impact characteristics.”

The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released the second version of a tool to analyze and visualize interlinkages amongst SDG targets. The SDG Interlinkages Analysis & Visualization Tool (version 2.0) methodology builds on the official SDG indicator framework, World Bank and other time series data, proxy indicators from other sources and a comprehensive literature to identify relationships between pairs of targets. The tool allows for quantitative analysis of SDG interlinkages, which, the release notes, can inform policy-making, priority-setting, resource allocation and monitoring efforts. A separate post on Eco-Business by Zafirah Zein highlights the importance of analyzing interlinkages amongst SDG targets, describing the Millennium Institute’s iSDG model.

An analysis by The Brookings Institution seeks to quantify how many people might be left behind, as well as identify those the world is set to “help,” by 2030. The authors’ study examines 21 “people-focused” SDG targets, segmented into absolute and relative terms (i.e. zero poverty versus reducing road deaths by half) and distinguished by life and death issues or basic needs (i.e. child mortality versus gender equality of opportunity). Preliminary findings suggest that, for six indicators alone, over 40 million lives are at stake. The study also features a country-by-country analysis that identifies where targeted actions are needed.

The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) launched its ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018,’ on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is forthcoming. The Index reviews the readiness of 86 countries to leave no one behind, looking at measures taken in the realms of data, policy and finance. A second ODI paper, titled ‘Leaving no one behind through enabling climate-resilient economic development in dryland regions’ looks at the issue in dryland economies. Linking data and the leave no one behind agenda, a blog by ODI’s Elizabeth Stuart released prior to the HLPF calls for “governments to be honest about failure and rigorous in analyzing progress.”

Engaging Businesses

With a variety of private sector actors in New York for the 17 July SDG Business Forum, a range of events and papers highlighted efforts that leaders in the private sector are taking to contribute towards the SDGs.

Harvard Kennedy School’s Corporate Responsibility Initiative and Business Fights Poverty released a paper titled, ‘Advocating Together for the SDGs: How civil society and business are joining voices to change policy attitudes and practices.’ The paper outlines six key building blocks for responsible and effective advocacy collaboration: 1) respect government’s leadership role; 2) put the interests of people and planet first; 3) invest sufficient resources at the outset to gather necessary data and evidence to build understanding; 4) understand and manage stakeholder dynamics; 5) ensure consistency between external positions and internal policies; and 6) conduct advocacy collaboration transparently. It features several examples of corporate-NGO advocacy efforts, as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives on global frameworks, such as We Are Still In.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) released a document prepared for the HLPF, which reviews ‘Business Action for Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ The paper identifies business actions on each of the SDGs that were reviewed, recommending that governments work with the private sector to build collaborative frameworks and policies that will leave no one behind, incentivize investment, and set a solid foundation for public-private partnerships and public procurement processes.

The UN Global Compact Local launched a report demonstrating how local networks can close gaps in SDG achievement. Titled, ‘Global Compact Local Networks: Accelerating National SDG Implementation 2018 Edition,’ the paper considers systematic business engagement through five areas of activity: awareness raising; capacity building; recognizing leadership; policy dialogue; and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Under these activities, the document describes case examples from more than 30 countries.

A paper by econsense takes a business view of the SDGs. Titled, ‘Taking on Sustainable Development in Germany,’ the paper advocates for an open dialogue with all stakeholders and encourages the German government to further-embrace the SDGs. Econsense emphasizes the need to recognize partnerships with the private sector as a means of not only driving SDG implementation, but also setting norms and ethical principles.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development also co-organized multiple events that highlighted additional report in the areas of water, sanitation and health (WASH), chemicals, human rights, investor needs and business reporting, on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is forthcoming.

143,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/well-designed-citizen-science-projects-can-help-monitor-sdg-6/,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Well-Designed Citizen Science Projects Can Help Monitor SDG 6,"This year’s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) discusses SDG 6 on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. One major goal of the HLPF is to review the qualitative status of the targets so as to improve water quality by 2030.

One important indicator for reviewing targets is indicator 6.3.2: ‘Proportion of bodies of waters with good ambient water quality’.

Governments face here one major challenge: the water quality data gap. Whereas there are common indicators to measure water quality such as pH, temperature, or the total amount of nitrogen, such indicators are not measured thoroughly for a comprehensive understanding of water quality. As the 6.3.2 indicator report highlights, many custodian agencies lack institutional structures and coordination to collate data and mobilize necessary personnel (United Nations, 2018).

In hopes of tackling the problem, there are signs for a shift from traditional data gathering – government authorities monitoring water quality through extensive networks – to additionally gathering data through citizen-led water quality monitoring activities. The thematic review paper for HLPF focusing on volunteer groups specifically refers to SDG 6, pinpointing the importance of citizens testing water samples in ensuring safe water and sanitation for all (HLPF, 2018).

‘Citizen Science’: Is it really useful to address the water quality data gap?

A relatively new concept, citizen-led monitoring is also referred to as ‘Citizen Science.’ It is one of the avenues suggested by the custodian agencies of SDG 6.3.2. But is the involvement of citizens really useful to address the water quality data gap?

According to Oxford Dictionary (2018), citizen science is “the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.” In other words, it refers to the involvement of citizens in scientific projects.

Such involvement can have important advantages, particularly in data collection. Because any citizen can go out to collect data, data samples are potentially large. Such data can also be collected in a cost-effective manner, and it can speed up and improve environmental detection. In other words, the more people are collecting good quality data, the higher the chances of detecting environmental changes early on.

Citizen science thus makes projects possible to operate at larger geographic scales and over longer periods of time, depending on available human and capital resources. For instance, the National Water Quality Monitoring Council points out that there are more than 1,720 citizen science groups just across the US, carrying out volunteer water quality monitoring (National Water Quality Monitoring Council n.d.). Earthwatch supported approximately 1,400 field research projects in more than 120 countries, as well as over 100,000 people joining Earthwatch projects to contribute 10 million hours of data collection (FreshWaterWatch n.d.).

However, literature points out that citizen science also has shortcomings. Collected data by volunteers may be skewed or biased because the volunteers may not have appropriate scientific knowledge and training to gather accurate data. Also, motivating volunteers to participate in water quality monitoring scientific projects can be quite difficult since volunteers may also lack necessary laboratory equipment and funding for proper data collection. Lastly, people tend to be selective about which citizen science project they participate in because interests vary. Particular public attention and funding, for example, are given to biodiversity monitoring of attractive species such as wolves, bears, and certain birds (McKinley et al., 2017).

The way forward for citizen science in water quality monitoring

Vigorous discussion is ongoing on how to overcome these obstacles in citizen science. The motivation of non-scientists to participate in citizen science can be increased by providing recognition and attribution for the work they have done, and when they gain feedback from the scientists on how their data were put to use. Analyses also point to increased motivation when the volunteers felt involved within the community. Furthermore, citizen science data can also have high statistical power if data samples are large, which has potential for correcting flawed and biased data.

So, is citizen science an effective method for tackling the water quality data gap? Literature reviews and a quick review of citizen science projects suggest that involving citizens in water quality monitoring has strong potential, that’s for sure. But to fully benefit from the involvement of citizens, possible bottlenecks have to be overcome.

At the United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we thus argue for well-designed citizen science projects in the field of water quality monitoring, considering lessons learnt from existing projects and other fields of practice. The custodian agencies could consider providing guidelines for good citizen science projects and encourage Member States to implement well-designed citizen science projects for resolving the water quality data gap.

The Global Councils on SDGs consist of interdisciplinary networks of decisionmakers from different areas, that seek to find innovative solutions for SDG implementation. Council members are invited to participate for a two-year term, with the aim to provide actionable insights, propose policies, develop technological solutions, and mobilize resources to drive progress towards the goals. The Councils were launched in February 2018 at the World Government Summit in Dubai, UAE.

The event titled, ‘The Future of Government and Implications for Agenda 2030: Introducing the Global Councils on SDGs,’ took place on the sidelines of the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF), on 17 July 2018.

Opening the meeting, Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative of UAE, noted that nine Councils have been established so far, and that eight other councils will be launched during the “second phase” of the initiative. The existing Councils target nine SDGs and are headed by the following officials: SDG 1 (no poverty) is chaired Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank; SDG 2 (zero hunger) is chaired by Christopher Fearne, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Malta; SDG 4 (quality education) is chaired by Irina Bokova, former Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) is chaired by Adnan Amin, Director-General, IRENA; SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) is chaired by Imad Fakhoury, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Jordan; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) is chaired by Aisha Bin Bishr, Director General, Smart Dubai Office, UAE; SDG 13 (climate action) is chaired by Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, UAE; SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) is chaired by Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and former Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) is chaired by Mari Kiviniemi, Deputy Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Radheya Alhashmi, Prime Minister’s Office, UAE, noted that the Councils are not limited to “VIPs” but should involve “all different actors of the community,” and called on them to come up with innovative ideas. She explained that during their first year of work, Councils should define initiatives that are impactful, while in their second year, they should collaborate and promote integration across their initiatives.

Yasir Al Naqbi, also from the UAE Prime Minister’s Office, announced that the 2019 World Government Summit will take place from 10-12 February 2019 in Dubai. The World Government Summit is a knowledge exchange platform at the intersection of government, technology, and innovation that functions as a thought leadership platform and networking hub for policymakers, experts and pioneers in human development. The Summit was commissioned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE, in 2013, and takes place annually.

Mohieldin said sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

In a session featuring Council chairs and members, Mahmoud Mohieldin said the SDG 1 Council, composed of 22 members, plans to produce global knowledge products, and will organize a competition to tackle poverty that will engage “many people” from academia and the private sector, among other areas. He announced that specific deliverables would be shared during the 2019 World Government Summit, and noted that sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

Adnan Amin, said there is a “huge interest” in being a member of the SDG 7 Council, with 150 applications having been received. He remarked that there is no enabling framework to take forward energy efficiency, and the SDG 7 Council could create momentum around this issue.

Meera Al Shaikh, Smart Dubai, on behalf of Aisha Bin Bishr, reported that the SDG 11 Council is composed of 11 members from various horizons, among others, from the World Council on City Data (WCCD) and IISD Reporting Services. She said the Council will use science, technology and innovation (STI) approaches as part of its framework, and will have a second meeting during the week of 23 July.

Eric Dawson, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peace First, and member of the SDG 16 Council, indicated that the Council will leverage the power of young people to create more peaceful and inclusive societies at all levels. He said the Council will: organize a global youth challenge for peaceful and inclusive societies; identify problems young people want to solve; and connect them to mentors and funding to support solution-oriented projects.

Masamichi Kono, Deputy Secretary-General, OECD, on behalf of Mari Kiviniemi, remarked that the SDG 17 Council is overarching and horizontal, and will operationalize partnerships in coherence with the other SDGs. Among its activities, he said the Council will define a clear roadmap on how partnership can lead to more effective SDG implementation, and is considering the establishment of a knowledge facility related to SDG governance. He reported that the Council had its first meeting on 2 July, and that it is composed of officials from, inter alia, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), UNDP, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), Slovenia and Finland.

During the meeting, participants also shared information on SDG implementation in countries. Juwang Zhu, Director, Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said that compared to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs are characterized by: a greater commitment from the top; stronger ownership and buy-in by Parliaments; better coordination; more emphasis on evidence-based analysis; and some “shift away” from the work in silo approach. He remarked that leaving no one behind (LNOB) is becoming the “yardstick” to measure real progress, and noted the various bottom-up initiatives carried out by stakeholders, including by business and civil society organizations (CSOs). He said the UAE is a small country with a strong commitment to global partnership, as it devotes more than one percent of its gross development product (GDP) to development cooperation.

Inge Herman Rydland, Special Envoy Agenda 2030, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway, outlined the importance of integrating the SDGs in national budgets, since this contributes to greater policy coherence and a better acceptance of the policy agenda. Timotej Šooš, National Development Strategy Lead, Slovenia, reported that his country is “doing quite well” on many areas of the SDGs, and noted the need to work more horizontally, across sectors. He also underscored the “very important role” of Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) for SDG implementation.

Al Naqbi said the UAE presented its voluntary national review (VNR) at the HLPF on 16 July 2018. He reported that: the UAE Minister of Youth is 22 years old, which makes her the youngest minister in the world; 33% of UAE Ministers are female; and the Head of Parliament is a woman.

The report titled, ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation,’ offers the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) a “joint position from the UN family on the global status on SDG 6 and other water-related targets.”



SDG 6 has eight targets, addressing: drinking water; sanitation and hygiene; water quality; water-use efficiency; integrated water resources management; water-related ecosystems; and means of implementation. The Synthesis Report outlines the challenges faced under each of these targets, provides charts depicting country and regional performance, discusses accelerating progress on the Goal, and provides summaries of ‘key messages’ on each target. The report concludes with general recommendations, including adopting “smart technologies” and engaging in multi-stakeholder partnerships, among other measures.

On drinking water (SDG target 6.1), coverage increased from 81% to 89% between 2000 and 2015, but progress among the lowest-performing countries has been insufficient to achieve universal coverage by 2030. On sanitation (SDG target 6.2), access to basic sanitation services increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period, but rural areas lag behind, and managing fecal sludge has become a challenge. The report highlights that substantial investment will be required, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, to install sewerage networks and sanitation systems, as well as strengthen the capacity of local and national authorities to manage them.

While progress monitoring on water and sanitation drew on data from at least the year 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, Synthesis Report authors observe that there has been a shorter history of collecting data on the other SDG 6 targets.

On water quality and wastewater treatment (SDG target 6.3), the report notes challenges for both developed and developing countries, especially with regard to monitoring industrial pollution. Preliminary estimates suggest that, in high to middle-income countries, 59% of household wastewater flows are safely treated, while the extent of industrial pollution is unknown.

On water-use efficiency (SDG target 6.4), the report finds a wide range of efficiency levels across the globe, and calls for additional indicators and data that can reflect improvements in agricultural use of water, and reduced losses in municipal distribution networks.

On integrated water resources management (IWRM) (SDG target 6.5), the report finds that most progress towards implementation has been in the areas of cross-sectoral coordination and public participation at the national level, but levels of financing, action on gender issues and aquifer management still remain low.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG target 6.6), the authors report that the world lost 70% of its natural wetlands over the last 100 years. Artificial water bodies such as reservoirs and rice paddies have increased; however data collection systems do not differentiate between artificial and natural wetlands. They call for further detailed data on water-related ecosystems and their benefits, and for complementing local data with earth observation data.

On means of implementation (SDG targets 6 a. and b.), the report cites research findings that the capital investments necessary to reach SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are around three times the current levels of investment, and that investments in achieving other targets will also require a significant increase.

The authors argue that achieving SDG 6 is crucial for achieving the rest of the 2030 Agenda. They also emphasize the interdependence among SDG 6 targets, noting, for example, the energy sector’s role in water withdrawals, and the possibility of reducing water pollution to increase access to freshwater.

To help develop key messages to be conveyed to the HLPF, an online multi-stakeholder dialogue on the report was launched on 2 May with a briefing for UN Member States. The dialogue, which will continue through September, will seek input according to the following guidelines: overall feedback (2-16 May); main messages for the HLPF (25 June to 9 July); and looking forward and next steps (31 August to 14 September).

At the HLPF, further discussions on achieving SDG 6 will take place in the context of several water-related events. They include, inter alia: a half-day review of SDG 6 implementation hosted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); a UN-Water side event on global progress on water and sanitation; a ‘Water and Faith Communities’ side event organized by the Ecumenical Water Network; and a side event on ‘Ensuring Intergenerational Policy Dialogues for the Achievement of SDG 6,’ which will explore opportunities for greater youth engagement, organized by the Water Youth Network, UN-Water, the International Hydrological Programme of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IHP) and the World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW).

The dialogue served as a springboard for knowledge exchange among countries in the region as they push forward on increasingly ambitious long-term development strategies.



During a session on integrating the NDCs and SDGs at national level, Michael Comstock, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted that SDG-related efforts contribute to NDC goals and vice-versa, given the “distinct but interlinked” processes. He highlighted research from the World Resources Institute (WRI) that finds climate actions align with 154 of the 169 SDG targets. However, he underscored challenges that hinder implementation, particularly the siloing of parallel processes with little communication between ministries despite substantive overlaps and potential duplication. Comstock outlined UNDP support to both the SDG and NDC processes, closing with a preview of a UNDP report titled, ‘Aligning NDCs and SDGs: Lessons Learned and Practical Guidance,’ to be launched later this year. [Presentation on Dialogue Objectives by Michael Comstock, UNDP]

Lee Cando, NDC Partnership, also stressed countries’ challenges of coordination, both horizontally across ministries and development partners, and vertically between national, sub-national and local governments. She flagged NDCs’ interdisciplinary nature, emphasizing that they cut across issues, and are not stand-alone climate or environment issues. Rather, they encompass a wide range of topics, including agriculture (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), transport (SDG 11) and forestry (SDG 15). [Presentation on Transforming NDCs into Action by Lee Cando, NDC Partnership]

Dialogue participants highlighted “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs.

Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute, presented the SDG Climate Action Nexus (SCAN) Tool for linking climate actions to the SDGs. The tool allows for analysis of trade-offs between SDGs that are in conflict, where progress on one may detract from or undermine that of another. However, for all SDGs, she noted, the synergies outweigh the trade-offs. [Presentation on SCAN Tool by Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute]

Representatives from Georgia and Armenia shared their countries’ experiences. Tea Avazashvili, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, Georgia, reviewed steps that the country has taken towards diversifying and improving its energy sources and security, noting policy developments around energy efficiency and renewables, which align closely with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Georgia’s key challenges for incorporating NDC and SDG actions, Avazashvili delineated, include low levels of awareness and lack of human, institutional and regulatory capacity. Asya Murudyan, Ministry of Nature Protection, Armenia, emphasized the country’s actions around adaptation as highlighted in its NDC.

With finance often being seen as an opportunity to join up implementation efforts towards the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, participants in the session on private sector engagement acknowledged “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs. Discussions covered strategies and means of implementation that are broadly recognized as contributing to both the climate and development agendas, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), an enabling policy environment and cooperation on green technologies to accelerate society’s transition towards more sustainable economic growth.

The Dialogue also featured discussions on how to integrate gender equality (SDG 5) into NDC implementation. Natasha Olofinskaya, UNDP, highlighted that gender is an enabling factor for all 17 SDGs, noting that it is not only supportive of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, but also has positive impacts on poverty reduction (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2) and health (SDG 3).

The Congress showcased new and emerging technologies for processing and using bamboo fiber and composite materials, highlighting its potential as a renewable natural resource.

Congress speakers and participants emphasized ways that bamboo and rattan can contribute to the SDGs on: no poverty (SDG 1); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); life on land (SDG 15); and partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): with reference to activities in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.

BARC 2018 took place from 25-27 June, on the theme of ‘Enhancing South-South Cooperation for Green Development through Bamboo and Rattan’s Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The Congress, organized by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NGFA), welcomed approximately 1,200 participants, including 500 visitors from 68 other countries. A ministerial summit and three high-level dialogues took place, in addition to 80 parallel sessions.

On SDG 1, speakers drew attention to projects that have promoted women’s entrepreneurship and empowerment through developing and promoting bamboo and rattan-based products. Terry Sunderland, University of British Columbia (UBC), called for a holistic approach and cautioned that calls for increased cultivation of bamboo should take into account land tenure and the role of women in economic activities, to ensure that rural communities truly benefit.

On SDG 7, participants discussed ways to expand the manufacture and distribution of bamboo charcoal, which is already being undertaken in Ghana, Jamaica and several other countries, noting the possibilities for small businesses in making bamboo charcoal briquettes, and the health benefits of substituting smoke-free bamboo charcoal for traditional fuels.

On housing (SDG target 11.1), discussions focused on construction standards and the properties of bamboo-based building products, including their lightness, flexibility, and superior insulating properties, as well as their resistance to fires, land subsidence and seismic activity. Participants noted that bamboo has been successfully used to build emergency shelters, and that the development of new types of resin, which used in conjunction with bamboo-based products, creates non-carcinogenic alternatives to treated pine.

On SDG 13, speakers highlighted the high levels of carbon sequestration in bamboo, and discussed methodologies for calculating the extent of sequestration. They noted that bamboo also has benefits for reducing carbon emissions in terms of emissions that are avoided by substituting bamboo for conventional timber products.

Regarding SDG 15, many participants expressed enthusiasm for cultivating bamboo to restore degraded lands and promote disaster risk reduction (DRR). They noted the value of bamboo as a critical food source for the giant panda, adding that conservation efforts around this iconic species could serve as “a giant umbrella” for the conservation of other species.

Discussions also touched on bamboo and rattan-related activities that promote food security (SDG 2), gender equality through women’s economic empowerment (SDG 5), and innovation in industry (SDG 9), with participants highlighting the market potential of bamboo across a variety of applications, including hi-tech and niche products in healthcare, sporting goods, and bamboo-composite building materials.

The conference adopted in principle the Beijing Declaration, which affirms INBAR member States’ support for developing the global bamboo and rattan industry through assessment of stocks, market and technology research, innovation, and standard setting. The Declaration calls upon national governments and other relevant parties to implement several recommendations, including, inter alia: carrying out inventories and assessments; establishing value chains accessing local, regional, and international markets by way of appropriate standards setting and quality control; encouraging bamboo and rattan technology innovation and research, as well as exchange of know-how. The Declaration also calls for investment from bilateral and multilateral financing mechanisms to support bamboo and rattan programmes and initiatives.

INBAR announced outcomes of BARC 2018 at the end of the conference, including several project agreements and upcoming meetings. Delegates noted agreement to initiate or extend several projects with UN agencies, partners, and donors, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Government of the Netherlands, the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainable Development, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), and conservation agencies willing to collaborate on the Giant Panda National Park that is being established by the Government of China. Further, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) offered to offset the carbon emissions generated by the Congress within the next 10 years through a bamboo-planting project in Yunnan province, China, thus making the Congress a carbon-neutral event.

Also at the meeting’s close, J.C. Hutchinson, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jamaica, announced a Caribbean Bamboo Conference to take place from 27-29 November 2018. It will bring together policy makers from the English-speaking Caribbean with experts from INBAR member States to discuss challenges and opportunities for bamboo in the region.

148,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wri-report-recommends-greater-alignment-of-sdg-ndc-implementation-to-enhance-action/,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WRI Report Recommends Greater Alignment of SDG, NDC Implementation to Enhance Action","17 July 2018: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change should be implemented jointly to help scale up actions and impact, according to a study that finds that, in most countries, climate actions under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national targets under the SDGs have been defined and advanced separately.

The paper, which was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), examines the ways in which the alignment of the two processes can be increased, despite their distinct histories, communities of actors and political dynamics.

The paper titled, ‘Connecting the Dots: Elements for a Joined-Up Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement,’ explains that the SDGs and climate actions embedded in NDCs are still largely implemented under distinct tracks, despite growing recognition of the strong connections between the two agendas, the opportunities they present for synergies, and the “short window of opportunity” for addressing the interlinked challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, poverty, rising inequality and fragile governance.

Drawing on examples and lessons learned from 11 countries and the EU, the publication outlines efforts to bridge the two implementation tracks, and explains that a growing number of countries have began taking concrete steps to advance both agendas as one. More specifically, the report provides options and examples for linking institutional, policy, financial, and monitoring and reporting frameworks that support joint implementation, which can reduce transaction costs and enhance policy coherence.

The paper describes five areas where countries are taking action to jointly implement the agenda: 1) ensuring institutional coordination; 2) ensuring alignment of and synergies between nationally relevant SDG targets and climate actions; 3) mainstreaming the SDGs and NDCs jointly into national planning and budgets; 4) optimizing financial resources; and 5) designing mutually supportive monitoring and reporting frameworks.

Cross-fertilization between SDG and NDC targets can lead to greater ambition.

On coordinating institutions, the paper explains that SDG and NDC lead institutions can build on their different strengths and authorities to more effectively engage governments and other stakeholders, and calls for consistent leadership and bringing the climate and development communities together.

On alignment of and synergies between SDG and NDC targets, the paper notes that climate policymakers have acknowledged limited understanding of the ways in which the SDGs can support climate policymaking, while sector ministries often view NDCs as technical documents that are difficult for use in policy planning. It explains that cross-fertilization and alignment can lead to greater ambition, and calls for designing single long-term carbon-neutral, sustainable development strategies.

The paper states that while few countries have sought greater alignment, Mexico released a study identifying NDC actions with the greatest SDG benefits as priority “development accelerators.” In addition, Kenya undertook an SDG impact assessment for its National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022. Both studies, it notes, call for, inter alia, measures to maximize climate action benefits on inequality reduction and gender equality.

On jointly mainstreaming both agendas into policy planning and budgeting, the paper recommends: sector-specific guidelines; consistent use of performance frameworks and budget-tagging systems that consider the objectives of both agendas; a comprehensive gap analysis of both agendas; monitoring; and involving SDG and NDC lead institutions in planning processes. The paper discusses Colombia’s use of consistent guidelines and support for building the SDGs and NDCs into local development plans, and explains that several countries have also started reviewing and enforcing SDG-NDC mainstreaming.

On optimizing budgetary and financial resources, the paper recommends, inter alia, mobilizing and tracking SDG-related and climate finance, and integrated fiscal and regulatory reforms to help scale up finance for both agendas.

On mutually reinforcing monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks, the paper states that: consistent sets of SDG, climate and other development indicators and common data strategies support integrated monitoring of outcomes, and national progress reports can more systematically address SDG-climate linkages. It outlines the ways in which the Philippines, Finland and Kenya have assessed the relevance of global SDG indicators in monitoring climate actions, especially adaptation, noting that several countries have included SDG and NDC reporting in annual growth reviews and budget processes.

In addition, the report describes the ways in which international development can better support national efforts to link the two agendas, and urges development partners to support national efforts to link implementation efforts through an integrated approach to capacity building and project planning.

The report suggests that global reporting frameworks under the Paris Agreement and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) could better support national efforts to merge SDG and NDC implementation, and contends that the HLPF and Talanoa Dialogue offer near-term opportunities for countries to develop synergies to ramp up national ambitions.

The SDG 6 Synthesis Report offers the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) a progress report on the eight indicators under the clean water and sanitation Goal. The first dialogue focused on the collection of overall feedback on the report. It asked the questions: How did you like the report?; Are there areas, topics or messages that are missing from the report, or that you would like to highlight or modify in view of HLPF? and What could be improved in possible future editions of the report? Respondents’ comments will be presented in a separate publication at the conclusion of the dialogues.

Providing feedback in the online public dialogue, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) underscored that all investment in planned sanitation infrastructure, in collaboration with local and regional governments, can have positive externalities for human development and the achievement of SDG 6 and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). UCLG explained that many local and regional governments are responsible for the provision of this service and they know better than any other tier of governance what vulnerable groups in what areas of the territory require more integration and better access to this service.

The Groundwater Solutions Initiative for Policy and Practice (GRIPP) proposed adding language related to the fact that SDG 6 and other cross-cutting targets within the SDG framework cannot be achieved without developing pro-active measures for groundwater management at all levels, including enhanced replenishment, demand management, protection, monitoring, reporting and enforcement. GRIPP further called upon the representatives of the respective custodian agencies to make an extra effort to further improve the step-by-step methodologies for the monitoring of SDG 6 target indicators, explaining that the currently proposed methodology generally recognizes the role of groundwater but may need to clearly specify the contribution of groundwater in the weighted calculations. By GRIPP’s intervention, the methodology should also include adequate groundwater measurement and monitoring methodologies to collect necessary data on a regular basis and in a way that can easily be applied at the national level.

Other stakeholders addressed issues related to, inter alia, the need to: better investigate the coherence among the SDG 6 targets within Goal 6; track the strength of enabling environments for private sector involvement, not just highlight the need for general cooperation with the private sector; include a stronger emphasis on water and sanitation as a human right; and include a stronger recognition of Indigenous Peoples as rights-holders.

150,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/2018-sdg-index-all-countries-must-change-policies-to-achieve-global-goals/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,2018 SDG Index: All Countries Must Change Policies to Achieve Global Goals,"9 July 2018: Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released the 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards report titled, ‘Global Responsibilities: Implementing the Goals,’ which tracks country progress towards the SDGs. The 2018 Index and Report find that no country is on track to achieve all of the SDGs, and progress is slowest on the environment-focused goals, such as SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land).

Christian Kroll, Bertelsmann Stiftung, explains in an SDSN press release that the Index’s calculations and projections indicate that all “countries will miss many of the SDGs if they do not up their game.” He stresses that countries face different challenges in achieving the SDGs, but they all have in common “the need to change current policies” to move towards SDG implementation and achievement.

While Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank the highest on the global SDG ranking, the report cautions that even high-ranking countries still face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs. For instance, Sweden is not on track to achieve SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 13 or 14. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) rank last in progress towards SDG achievement.

Countries experiencing conflict have experienced reversals in their SDG progress, particularly on Goals 1 and 2.

The report finds that many developing countries have made significant progress on SDG 1 (no poverty) and related measures on access to education and health services and to basic infrastructure. The report warns, however, that countries experiencing conflict have experienced reversals in their SDG progress, particularly on Goals 1 and 2.

The SDG Index 2018 also includes a measure of country progress on the 2030 Agenda’s principle of “leave no one behind,” for the first time. According to the Index, many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are performing poorly on this principle, as shown by progress towards targets on regional disparities in health care on SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and on learning outcomes under SDG 4 (quality education). The Index observes that comparable data on non-OECD countries’ progress on tackling inequality are not available, underscoring an urgent need to increase investments in data systems.

The report also analyzes Group of 20 (G20) government commitments to achieving the SDGs. It finds that almost all G20 countries have made some efforts to implement the SDGs, but all of these countries also fall short in areas related to government accountability mechanisms, budgeting and public management. The report identifies Brazil, Mexico and Italy as performing relatively highly on institutional implementation measures, as evidenced by SDG coordination units and strategies, while the US and the Russian Federation perform the worst. The report further observes that no G20 country has “fully aligned” its national budget with the SDGs.

The 2018 Index includes new data and indicators, which means that country performance cannot be compared with previous SDG Index scores.

151,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholder-report-measures-up-uk-performance-on-sdgs/,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholder Report 'Measures up' UK Performance on SDGs,"17 July 2018: An event convened in the margins of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) celebrated the launch of the report titled, ‘Measuring Up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’ Organized by UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and hosted by PwC, the discussion reviewed the report’s key findings and methodology.

Bringing together experts from over 100 organizations across the UK, the report offers the first comprehensive review of SDG delivery in the country, covering all 17 Goals and 143 of the 169 targets. Emily Auckland, UKSSD Co-Chair, emphasized that the scope primarily focuses on domestic delivery of the SDGs within the UK, and that the report does not compare the UK to other countries. On the authoring process, she explained that each chapter of ‘Measuring Up’ —the first section of which reviews progress on a Goal-by-Goal basis—was led by one or two UKSSD members, based on their strengths and area of expertise. The report’s second section examines procedural aspects of SDG delivery in the UK, including governance arrangements and the roles of stakeholders.

The report finds that the UK performs well on 24% of the targets, has performance gaps on 57%, and shows little to no policy change or otherwise poor performance on 15%. For 3% of targets, there were not enough data available to make an informed assessment. The report utilized publicly available data from international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank, as well as from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). UKSSD also notes that in authoring the report, they identified data gaps on the UK’s impacts abroad, including through supply chains and on marine pollution. Although accounting for the country’s global reach is embedded in the thinking, UKSSD noted, additional measures are needed take stock to take stock.

Areas of high performance include SDGs 3, 4 and 17. The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15.

Areas of high performance by the UK include SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15 (life on land), and on several Goals (2, 5, 9 and 13) not a single target is marked as green (“good”). In terms of efficiently accelerating progress, the report notes that although the UK’s implementation framework of Single Departmental Plans (SDPs) are a practical way of delegating authority, there is a risk that doing so will reduce recognitions of interlinkages across the Goals and targets, thereby siloing efforts or reduce their effectiveness. Thus, the report calls for cross-departmental action to ensure policy coherence.

Dominic White, Co-Chair, UKSSD, highlighted that the report is put forth in the spirit of collaboration, offered in lieu of government capacity, to recognize what a performance review looks like from a stakeholder perspective. He emphasized synergies between the UK and global contexts, noting that this is “where sustainable development comes home.” On methodology, he underscored the stringency of the review, noting that UKSSD applied the “leave no one behind” principle when analyzing targets: if a person or group is not getting the full benefits of a target, the target is not scored as green.

Looking ahead, White described the ‘Measuring Up’ report and the UK’s intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 HLPF as opening a “policy window” where experiences can be built on and taken further, and gaps identified by the report can be addressed. The discussion also raised the broader importance of “voluntary stakeholder reviews” (VSRs), which can serve as a baseline for, or to complement, inform, strengthen—or in some cases refute—countries’ official VNRs on progress towards the SDGs.

The event follows the report’s initial launch, held at the UK House of Commons on 3 July 2018. The ‘Measuring Up’ project has been supported by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Pearson, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Sodexo, DNV GL, PwC, Stakeholder Forum and Thai Union.

152,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-paper-tests-methodology-for-prioritizing-sdgs-indicators/,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"World Bank Paper Tests Methodology for Prioritizing SDGs, Indicators","June 2018: The Office of the World Bank Group’s Senior Vice President for 2030 Agenda, UN Relations and Partnerships has outlined a methodology for helping policy makers to prioritize SDG targets in their development plans. The authors argue that how a country will perform on a specific SDG indicator is dependent on progress on other SDGs, and they introduce the concepts of “SDG proximity,” “SDG centrality” and “SDG density” to consider specific indicators.



The Policy Research Working Paper titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals Diagnostics An Application of Network Theory and Complexity Measures to Set Country Priorities,’ uses a database on SDG progress, constructed using data from the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG‐SDGs), the World Bank’s SDG database (WB‐SDGs), and additional external data. The database includes the majority of “Tier 1” indicators, as categorized by the IAEG-SDGs.

The authors posit that “if a set of positive development outcomes are observed frequently coexisting across countries, then there are strong commonalities” in their underlying delivery mechanisms. The methodology considers 1) country capacities such as skills, infrastructure, technology, institutions and natural resources; 2) countries’ SDG delivery mechanisms, whether intentionally or unintentionally created; and 3) the resulting observable development outcomes.

The authors note that the extent to which capacities can be used between SDGs is dependent on their proximity to one another. They define “SDG proximity” as the conditional probability of two indicators being “successful” together, a function of the commonalities shared. For example, the indicator “number of physicians per 1,000 people” is likely to have more commonalities with—and be closer in proximity to—an indicator to measure malnutrition than it would with one on marine protected areas.

If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with many “proximities,” the country is likely to also achieve progress in others.

The sum of a Goal’s proximities provides its measure of “SDG centrality,” the paper explains. If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with high centrality, the country is likely to also achieve progress in others. SDGs 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 6 (clean water and sanitation) are calculated to be the most “central,” while Goals 1 (no poverty) and 13 (climate action) are calculated to be the least central.

The highest-ranked indicators in terms of centrality relate to access to electricity, and populations using improved drinking water sources. The least central indicators address varied themes, including gender parity, disaster risk reduction strategies, education, time spent on unpaid domestic work, employment in agriculture, malaria incidence rates, and the number of breeds classified as being not-at-risk of extinction, among others. However, the authors caution against “writing off” an SDG or indicator as irrelevant simply because it features limited connections.

To prioritize actions, the authors cite the importance of an SDG’s “density” in a country. This is defined on the basis of the Goal’s proximities to others in which the country is successful. It will be easier to make progress on a high-density SDG than a low-density SDG. The paper suggests that governments can use the concepts of SDG proximity, centrality and density to redeploy SDG delivery mechanisms or other capacities, in order to maximize impact.

The authors highlight that other recent work also focuses on SDG interconnectedness, the probability of over-performing on a specific target given progress on others, and whether achievement of some targets promotes or accelerates progress on others. These include recent efforts by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), David Le Blanc for the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), and implementation of the Country Development Diagnostics Framework.

The IPoA report provides comprehensive information and analysis on recent progress in LDC countries, covering eight priority areas for action and the overarching goal of enabling graduation from the category.

Per the report, the UN Committee for Development Policy, held in March 2018, found that 12 of the LDCs had met graduation thresholds, occupying various stages in the graduation process. This shows a marked increase from the five LDCs that have graduated since the creation of the LDCs category in 1971. Among the 12 countries: Bhutan, Kiribati, Sao Tome and Principe, and the Solomon Islands were recommended for graduation by the Committee for Development Policy, while for Nepal and Timor-Leste, the Committee will revisit the sustainability of progress at the next triennial review; three of the LDCs, Bangladesh, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, met the graduation criteria for the first time in 2018.

The IPoA report notes the positive impacts of advances on access to information and communications technology (ICT), sustainable energy, human and social development indicators (for example, relating to health, education and gender equality, governance indicators and domestic resource mobilization. The publication stresses, however, that significant gaps that must be closed to meet IPoA goals. These include speeding up structural transformation and increasing the share of the LDCs in exports in world trade, as well as diversifying away from commodities. The report also highlights that: gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates fall short of the 7% target in most of LDCs; and that expenditure on social protection is still significantly lower in the LDCs than in other developing countries, corresponding to relatively low tax revenues. Other gaps relate to limited investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI) and stagnant official development assistance (ODA) flows to LDCs that remain below targets.

The IPoA report reflects decisions and actions by Member States on implementation, including the outcome of the mid-term review that took place in Antalya, Turkey, in May 2016. The report further highlights activities by other stakeholders, including the UN system, civil society and the private sector. It recommends that IPoA implementation be accelerated to ensure that its goals and targets are achieved by 2020, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

In July, ECOSOC is convening its annual organizational session and its Coordination and Management Meeting (CCM), which reviews specific development issues and considers special country situations or regional issues.

SDG target 12.6 calls for companies to “integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.”



Titled, ‘In Focus: Addressing Investor Needs in Business Reporting on the SDGs,’ the paper offers guidance to companies to ensure that their disclosures help mobilize the finance needed to achieve the SDGs. The publication’s forward notes that investors seek information on 1) how businesses are reaping results from their competitive advantages connected to the SDGs, and 2) the relevance of the SDGs to overall strategies.

The report aims to facilitate greater comparison across companies, and strengthen the case for investment in line with the SDGs.

Aimed primarily at the “corporate sustainability reporting practitioners” who are responsible for integrating SDG information into their companies’ reporting processes, the report intends to build on existing disclosure standards to facilitate greater comparison across companies. The publication stresses that it does not seek to impose an additional reporting standard or framework on companies, but rather seeks to “demonstrate what good, investor-relevant business reporting around the SDGs looks like” to strengthen the case for investment in line with the Goals.

In a press release on the publication, GRI CEO Tim Mohin says that investors prefer to see balanced reporting and companies’ targets mapped against the SDGs. Doing so in line with common standards, he notes, can enable more consistent and comparable data.

The paper highlights four C’s of sustainability reporting: concise, consistent, current and comparable. With this information, the authors note, investors can direct capital flows such that they not only amplify business opportunities and generate profits, but also yield social and environmental returns for society, in line with the SDGs. Further, not achieving the SDGs can impede business profitability, and thus reduce investors’ returns.

The report’s ten key recommendations focus on: message and approach; strategy and governance; report content; and data format. They address characteristics that companies can take to ensure meaningful SDG uptake—such as rewards for meeting SDG targets—as well as best practices, such as providing links to raw data so analysts can review or normalize it as needed. The recommendations are placed in context, with the report describing how reporters and investors can align their engagement efforts, for example, so that investors can understand the potential short-term trade-offs required to realize long-term gains.

The paper also distinguishes between an SDG approach and an environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach, noting that the former considers external impacts by the business, but does not cover corporate governance, which can often be a means of delivering environmental and social outcomes.

The report follows an earlier document that outlines actions companies can take in line with the SDGs, titled, ‘An Analysis of the Goals and Targets.’ It also recognizes the 2017 ‘Stockholm Declaration’ on Investors and corporate SDG reporting.

GRI, PRI and UN Global Compact note that the ‘In Focus’ report will be followed in late 2018 by a publication titled, ‘Integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting: A Practical Guide,’ from which some of the In Focus graphics are taken.

155,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-analyzes-countries-readiness-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Analyzes Countries’ Readiness to Leave No One Behind,"18 July 2018: A briefing note and index launched in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) reviews the readiness of 86 countries to “leave no one behind.” With the SDGs in effect for nearly 1,000 days, the Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI) ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018’ explores the extent to which countries have the required data, policies and financing in place.

Elizabeth Stuart, ODI, emphasized during the launch event in New York, US, on 18 July 2018, that “we know what it takes” to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda, as articulated by the Index:

data to identify who is left behind and take stock of progress;

a reprioritization of policies to ensure that affected communities receive the resources they need;

finance, particularly in the areas of education, health and social protection; and

a rethinking of donors’ “risk appetites” to go beyond a poverty reduction agenda.

The 2018 Index builds on an inaugural Index released in 2017, adding a policy indicator on resilience, in line with the theme of the 2018 HLPF. Data collected on the additional indicator show that, of the 86 countries reviewed, more than half (46) are “not ready” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective. Stuart said a new indicator will be added annually, in line with the theme of each year’s HLPF.

The updated Index includes all countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018. On progress, the briefing note highlights that much of the progress made since last year has been in the realm of data, and 11 countries have improved their index score since 2017. Overall, ODI finds that 55 countries are “ready” to meet their commitment, 24 are “partially ready,” five are “not ready,” and two have insufficient data to make an informed assessment. The briefing note concludes that “many countries are insufficiently prepared” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective, with a quarter failing to enact appropriate policy frameworks. Further, the briefing note flags as a concern the finding that, despite the theme of the 2018 HLPF, most countries fail to identify, let alone prioritize, those most at risk of being left behind in the preparation of their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and other adaptation projects. A search of 57 countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change found that almost half did not contain a single mention of ODI’s keywords relating to a leave no one behind agenda.

ODI’s Index considers four indicators of outcomes: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment.

During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, highlighted that the leave no one behind terminology can “mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people,” and can be viewed from a variety of lenses, including income, geography, gender or location. On this, he noted a UNDP discussion paper to be released in the coming weeks titled, ‘What does it mean to leave no one behind?’ that will present a framework for implementation. Steiner also flagged that the SDGs are not a starting point, but rather a reminder of what we have left to do, following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. He and Stuart acknowledged, however, that the SDGs were agreed during a “high water mark for multilateralism,” and that in today’s very different political environment it is important to “keep driving through” and continue a positive narrative.

Isidoro Santana, Minister of Economy, Planning and Development, Dominican Republic, outlined challenges his country is facing, especially on tax capacity and domestic resource mobilization. He lamented that although a significant amount of public funding goes towards education, this leaves other social issues unattended. He noted that the Dominican Republic and many other middle-income countries (MICs) face a decline in official development assistance (ODA) at a time when domestic resources are not yet able to fill the finance gap, and addressing this could help to deliver the leave no one behind agenda.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, Canada, described measures that her government has taken to achieve leaving no one behind domestically, highlighting indigenous communities, affordable housing, and safe, clean drinking water as areas needing more action. She noted policy reforms that aim to lift children out of poverty, enhance workers’ benefits, and introduce a rights framework for indigenous communities, calling the SDGs an opportunity to link the “usual and unusual suspects together.” Caesar-Chavannes also emphasized Canada’s “feminist foreign policy,” saying it provides a gateway to being able to name and talk about those who are left behind. She noted investments in Canada’s national statistics office to add capacity on disaggregation and better tracking of outcomes.

While ODI’s Index primarily focuses on countries’ readiness to leave no one behind, it also considers four indicators of outcomes in order to demonstrate actual progress: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment. It aggregates data on these outcomes to assess whether countries are on track to leave no one behind, scoring them as on track, off track or making partial progress.

ODI’s analysis finds “a clear correlation” between countries’ readiness and outcome scores.

On the first day, governments began an “in-depth review” of selected SDGs, with a session on global progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Delegates heard that “the world is not on track” to meet the SDG 6 targets by 2030, in view of increasing freshwater pollution, water stress, and a declining share of official development assistance (ODA) for water-related activities.



The review of SDG 6 featured several high-level speakers, including Danilo Turk, Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace and former President of Slovenia, and Leo Heller, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation. The review of SDG 6 was aided by the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report,’ which was prepared under UN-Water coordination and presented by Stefan Uhlenbrook, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The discussion was moderated by Joakim Harlin, UN-Water.

Delegates discussed their national efforts to achieve SDG 6 and highlighted the need for good governance and partnerships. Several speakers underscored the links between water, peace and security, and Turk proposed holding an international conference on water management to discuss infrastructure and financing. Many speakers lamented the fact that the HLPF would only devote three hours to a review of SDG 6 during its four-year cycle.

IWMI said cities can be water producers, not only water consumers.

Non-governmental speakers also presented their perspectives on SDG 6. Claudia Sadoff, International Water Management Institute (IWMI), stated that cities can be water producers, not only water consumers. The Major Group for Workers and Trade Unions cautioned against privatization, and called for water utilities to be “re-municipalized” to improve equity in service delivery. Other speakers noted the need to promote efficiency of water use in the agriculture and energy sectors.

Among other issues discussed during the opening day of the 2018 HLPF was the US$200 billion shortfall in SDG financing. Keynote speaker Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University, proposed ways to cover this shortfall, including by closing tax havens, taxing the five big technology companies, and establishing a global carbon tax.

In addition, the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) anticipated the launch of a financing framework for SDG data, in October 2018. Also on the use of data for monitoring progress, participants raised the need for disaggregated data to reveal inequalities and lack of inclusion, for example, of people with disabilities.

Three panels consisting of speakers from civil society, the private sector and the UN system described the context for the evening’s event, articulated the links between sustainability, oceans and climate, and offered examples of public-private partnerships to help deliver the SDGs.

Organized in Partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) and the UN Global Compact, the event provided new perspectives, including from youth, on how to make the world more peaceful and inclusive. Genevieve Jiva, Fiji, one of the Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassadors, described the process of a Talanoa dialogue, noting that it seeks to answer three questions: Where are we? Where do we need to go? How do we get there? These are the questions, she described, that the Youth Ambassadors address as they travel with Peace Boat to raise awareness and inspire action on the Goals.

Challenges and Opportunities

Speakers discussed current challenges, raising issues of ocean plastic, elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poverty, food insecurity and food waste, but also identified areas of hope. Cora Weiss, Hague Appeal for Peace, noted that peace makes it possible for sustainable development to happen, highlighting the recent peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea as setting the stage for progress. Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, in remarks delivered by video, flagged that more people need to know why the ocean and environment matter.

Echoing Earle, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that humanity has not been sufficiently taught about the need for action. Thomson cautioned that the world is still on a path to three degrees warming, a “dangerous uncertainty.” He emphasized the need for multilateralism, “now more than ever,” to teach humanity how to implement the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

We are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.

Former Astronaut Col. Ron J. Garan described an example of a man on a horse, who, when asked where he was going, responded, “I don’t know, ask the horse!” Drawing comparisons to Thomson’s remarks, he noted that “we are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.” He underscored the need for a new perspective, articulating how his experience in space shifted his worldview. We as a global society, he noted, need to move from a model of fragmented nation-states that consume as if there are unlimited natural resources, to one where we are common occupants of a single planet, recognizing our finite supplies.

Going Forward

Andrew Friedman, AJF Financial Services, Inc., expressed his desire to one day live in a world where we don’t have to use the word sustainable, because sustainability is already ingrained into everyday life. To get there, he offered perspective on action being taken outside of the UN system. Friedman emphasized the role of organizations like US SIF (the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as key to making progress in the private sector, and highlighted the need for shareholder activism.

Robert Skinner, UNOP, highlighted how the Office acts as a gateway and platform to connect and convene actors, including those from the private sector, noting similarities to Peace Boat as a means of sharing information to create a better world. Dan Thomas, delivering remarks on behalf of Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact, also recognized that Peace Boat provides a means for decision-makers and civil society alike to connect informally, outside a more formal UN setting.

Yoshioka Tatsuya, Peace Boat Founder and Marie Chatardová, President of ECOSOC, each highlighted that without peace, we cannot achieve the SDGs. International frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement on climate change, they noted, are both a vision and a means of achieving a sustainable, peaceful world.

Peace Boat is docked in the Hudson River, across town from UN Headquarters where the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is currently underway. Event participants pointed out that it offers an opportunity for networking and idea exchange outside of UN Headquarters.

Drawing on experiences from 16 predominantly megadiverse countries, the report highlights examples of good practices and remaining challenges in four key areas related to biodiversity mainstreaming. These include: at the national level, including national development plans and national budgets; in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors; in development co-operation; and the monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity mainstreaming. The analysis examines countries that span all income groups, from high-income economies such as Australia and France to lower-income economies such as Ethiopia and Madagascar.

The report notes that, for biodiversity mainstreaming to be effective, it should occur across all levels of government and include all relevant stakeholders, as entry points interact and are located at different levels of governance. To support implementation, the publication points out that mainstreaming initiatives need to be accompanied by budgetary allocations.

The report recommends, inter alia, that governments prioritize actions that underwrite a strong business case for biodiversity. These include: conducting a national assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services outlining the key pressures on biodiversity and incorporating, where possible, the full social benefits that ecosystems and ecosystem services provide, including monetary values where feasible. These also include integrating biodiversity-related considerations into sector-level resource assessments – for instance, agriculture, forestry, fisheries – and identifying key pressures in each case. Other actions to be prioritized include: investing in statistical and/or data systems to establish an evidence base on the drivers, pressures and state of biodiversity; and developing targeted messages that support collaborative solutions.

The Forum, organized in collaboration with the European Commission, Mexico, Egypt, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, was held at the margins of the second meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation SBI 2 under the CBD.

Many speakers called for justice, dignity and a human rights-based approach to affordable housing in cities. Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, argued that housing (SDG target 11.1) is the most significant issue facing cities today, and highlighted the injustice of development that destroys urban neighborhoods and displaces residents.

Marc Pecsteen, Permanent Representative of Belgium and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), chaired the session reviewing SDG 11. Discussions drew on the joint report by UN-Habitat and partner agencies, released on 9 July, which outlined global progress and challenges for sustainable cities. The report titled, ‘SDG 11 Synthesis Report: Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ presents UN agencies’ joint position.

Benjamin Rae, Statistics Division, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), stressed that, if States continue to rely on the private sector for housing, then they are obliged to ensure markets provide affordable housing.

Rohit Aggarwala, Columbia University, noted there is no “one size fits all” formula for achieving the various SDG 11 targets, and called for thoughtful and comprehensive management of urban issues and appropriate distribution of powers.

Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, New York City, highlighted that New York is the first city in the world to submit a voluntary local review to the UN, and has declared 11 July to be Global Goals Day in honor of the SDGs. She highlighted commonalities between the SDGs and the OneNYC campaign, including: principles of growth, equity, sustainability and resilience; consultative processes with local agencies, residents and businesses; commitment to leave no one behind; and measurement of progress. Noting that “progress is in fact possible,” she highlighted the city has achieved cleaner air and water, record wage growth, and tripled the number of children accessing quality early childhood education.

Jean Todt, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, observed that urbanization is strongly correlated with the use of motor vehicles. He highlighted the economic and social cost of road accidents, and argued that road safety (SDG target 11.2) should be considered part and parcel of sustainable mobility and transport, citing a combination of necessary policy elements, including affordable public transport and infrastructure for motorized and non-motorized transport.

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, noted that, while the percentage of slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing has decreased, their absolute numbers nevertheless has increased. She defined three key challenges for implementing SDG 11: housing affordability (SDG target 11.1), accessibility and adequacy of housing; management of urban sprawl (SDG target 11.3 on sustainable human settlement planning); and access to public spaces (SDG target 11.7). She added that monitoring progress will depend on having common definitions and units of analysis, and drew attention to UN-Habitat’s National Sample of Cities as a model for aggregating data from different cities within a country so as to discern dominant patterns.

Meera AlShaikh, Project Manager, Smart Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighted the high ecological footprint of urban areas and presented Dubai’s strategies for providing solar energy, increased use of recycled water, and various technologies including blockchain, AI and ICT services to enable Dubai’s transformation as a smart city.

Other speakers emphasized the need for finding new approaches to citizen participation, participatory governance by the urban poor, cities’ connections with rural ecosystems, post-disaster management to “build back better,” and the need to stop gender-based violence.

Many UN Member States, major groups, UN agencies and international organizations made interventions from the floor, highlighting country and programme experiences. Delegates linked improvements in urban spaces to poverty alleviation, and some countries, including Brazil and Sierra Leone, stressed the right to housing as an integral part of sustainable cities. They noted the particular needs of women, persons with disabilities, youth, and elderly persons, and drew attention to conflict as a driver for migrants and refugees moving to cities. Several delegates gave examples of “smart city” approaches that not only promote the use of digital technologies but also increase social inclusion, environmental sustainability and quality of life for urban residents.

Many also cited air quality as an important element of sustainable cities, noting the benefits of electric vehicles for reducing air pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) noted that only 12% of cities meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.

Concluding the session, Abeywardena highlighted that “this is not just about SDG 11,” but about the roles that cities will play in achieving all the SDGs.

164,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholders-share-views-on-hlpf-effectiveness-ahead-of-2019-review/,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholders Share Views on HLPF Effectiveness Ahead of 2019 Review,"9 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants exchanged views on the value, role and future of the HLPF, including an upcoming process to review its format and organizational aspects. The side event titled, ‘Stakeholder Engagement in the HLPF and its Review in 2019,’ was organized by the Major Groups and Other Stakeholder (MGOS), and took place on the first day of the HLPF.

Opening the event, Jeffery Huffines, CIVICUS, noted that in 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and another one at the level of the UNGA. In addition, beginning in September 2019, he said governments will begin a process of reviewing the HLPF’s format and organizational aspects.

The HLPF was established in 2013, through UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 67/290, in accordance with paragraph 84 of ‘The Future We Want,’ the outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Resolution 67/290 was followed by the adoption of UNGA resolution 70/299 in July 2016 that clarifies various elements related to the follow-up and review functions of the HLPF, including the specific themes of the Forum for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as the set of SDGs to be reviewed in depth in those years. Resolution 70/299 also notes that progress in its implementation and in the implementation of UNGA resolution 67/290 will be reviewed by the UNGA at its 74th session (2019-2020) “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.

In the context of this upcoming review process, panelists at the side event highlighted concerns and suggestions with regard to MGOS participation in the HLPF. Stefano Prato, Society for International Development, noted that despite a “significant shrinking” of space for civic engagement, there is capacity to “bridge democratic and bureaucratic deficit.” He called on MGOS to take concrete steps to ensure the participation of “right-holders” (such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, migrants and refugees), in the Forum. He also called on MGOS to “connect the dots” by linking engagement mechanisms between various thematic platforms, such as financing for development (FfD) or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). He underlined the need to better organize, engage more closely with the regional level, and change the nature of the HLPF in a way that allows taking “collective” decisions on issues that need to be addressed.

Mohammed Ali Loutfy, Disabled Peoples International (DPI), said: coalitions composed of civil society and stakeholders should be better supported and recognized as part of SDG reviews; more stakeholders should be involved in SDG implementation at the national level; and there should be increased engagement with local authorities and grassroot groups, and improved coordination between UN agencies and civil society. He called for bringing different participatory processes together, and suggested to have stakeholders represented in the office(s) in charge of SDG implementation at the national level.

Beisheim noted that the thematic reviews lack guidelines, have difficult-to-follow preparatory processes, and lack actionable results.

Marianne Beisheim, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, characterized the HLPF as “the institutional home” of the SDGs, recalling that one of its roles is to follow up on and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. She said there are complementary components of the follow-up and review process, such as the thematic reviews, regional reviews, voluntary national reviews (VNRs), the SDG progress report issued by the UN Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). On issues with the thematic reviews, she noted, inter alia, the absence of guidelines, the difficulty to follow preparatory processes, and the lack of actionable results. On VNRs, she remarked that quality of national preparatory processes and reports vary, national reviews often lack analysis of good practices and challenges, and there is limited room for critical questions from MGOS. She underlined the limited time for in-depth discussions at the HLPF, and the need to secure actionable results for both the thematic reviews and the VNRs.

Among other suggestions, Beisheim called for guidelines and for including policy recommendations from thematic reviews and VNRs in HLPF outcome documents. She also proposed that designated custodian institutions publish a roadmap on preparatory and follow-up process for thematic reviews “in good time,” and that the HLPF makes more room for debates related to VNRs.

Rebecca Malay, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, GCAP, noted that most thematic reviews and VNRs do not frame the SDGs based on a human rights approach. She remarked that the SDG indicators are often “confined” to technocrats, without civil society involvement. She also observed that the many independent reports prepared by civil society organizations on SDG national implementation (“shadow reports”) are not available on the HLPF’s VNR website.

On lessons learned regarding the HLPF so far, Sachini Perera, International Women’s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW), RESURJ, said the review of the HLPF in 2019 should take into account the ongoing UN reform, and should examine how human rights can be incorporated in the Forum, adding that human rights processes are currently overlooked when assessing SDG progress.

Discussing stakeholder engagement in the HLPF and its review in 2019, Jan-Gustav Strandenaes, Stakeholder Forum, said paragraph 15 of resolution 67/290 defines civil society’s rights and privileges at the HLPF. This paragraph allows MGOS to: attend all official meetings of the forum; have access to all official information and documents; intervene in official meetings; submit documents and present written and oral contributions; make recommendations; and organize side events and round tables, in cooperation with UN Member States and the UN Secretariat. Compared to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that preceded the establishment of the HLPF, however, Strandenaes noted that some privileges have been lost, including the access and participation to all negotiations, access to all rooms and participation in all meetings, and access to all delegates on the floor. He also underscored the “enormous” mandate of the HLPF, as defined in resolution 67/290 and the 2030 Agenda, and identified elements that should be improved, including on emerging issues, the science-policy interface, stakeholder engagement, and on developing and negotiating the Ministerial Declaration.

Several countries and organizations outlined examples of SIDS partnerships and initiatives they launched. Many also called for: predictability and continuity of SIDS support; ensuring monitoring and accountability of partnerships at the global and national levels; and strengthening capacity building, including on resource mobilization.

The annual Global Multi-Stakeholder SIDS Partnership Dialogue is one component of the SIDS Partnership Framework established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) following the Third International Conference on SIDS, held in Samoa in 2014. The Dialogue provides a global platform for SIDS and partners to review progress of existing partnerships for SIDS, launch new partnerships, and allow stakeholders to exchange lessons learned and identify good practices. The 2018 Dialogue took place at the UN Headquarters in New York, US, in parallel with the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing the meeting on 12 July 2018, Peter Thomson, Ambassador and UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that the UN Ocean Conference in June 2017 resulted in over 1,400 voluntary commitments to advance implementation of SDG 14 (Life below water), and a large number of these commitments were announced by SIDS countries. He remarked that the financial sector is “getting on board” and many governments are being more active than before on the oceans Goal He added that multilateralism is more needed than ever, and genuine and durable partnerships are “the best way forward.”

François Martel, Secretary-General, Pacific Islands Development Forum, said partnerships need to focus more on community resilience, and remarked that most of the best partnerships come from islands and are replicable. Simona Marinescu, UN Resident Coordinator and UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Samoa, stressed the importance of internal partnerships within the SIDS, and noted the need for relevance, respect for sovereignty, commonality and additionality, and political consensus for meaningful partnerships.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative for the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and SIDS, remarked that recurrent natural disasters in SIDS countries make it difficult to attract financing, and indicated that the 2018 SIDS Global Business Network Forum in Mauritius, convened by the UN Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) together with the government of Mauritius, was the third in a series of SIDS private sector partnership fora launched by UN-OHRLLS and its partners. She noted that the one-day high-level review of progress on the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway scheduled for September 2019 will be an opportunity to assess progress and consider priorities for action in the coming years.

Elliott Harris, Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Chief Economist, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) noted that preparations for the 2019 high-level review are already underway. He noted that DESA, with the funding support provided by Italy, is undertaking a project to increase stakeholder capacity to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Samoa Pathway in line with the high-level review preparatory process.

Among other initiatives, Aliioaiga Feturi Elisaia, Permanent Representative of Samoa, noted that the Pacific Resilience Fund seeks to provide resources to South Pacific communities to invest in their resilience to climate change. Saud Al Shamsi, Deputy Permanent Representative of United Arab Emirates (UAE), outlined the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund (UAE-PPF), and the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund (UAE-CREF), two funds of US$50 million each, for renewable energy projects in Pacific Island nations and Caribbean countries. He called on SIDS to consider forecast-based financing, an innovative mechanism where early preparedness and community-level actions are pre-planned based on credible forecasts, and are funded and implemented before disasters strike.

Ahmed’ Abdel-Latif, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) noted that sustainable energy is a key area for SIDS partnerships, and underlined the success of the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative, that seeks to bring together SIDS and partners to promote the accelerated deployment of renewables on islands. He also reported that 20 SIDS adopted national energy roadmaps to support their transition to renewable energy. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) provided several examples of partnerships it carried out with the SIDS, and said it is planning to revive the University Consortium of Small Island States (UCSIS) together with DESA and other partners.

Canada told the SIDS “your challenges are our challenges,” adding her country would invest $162 million to support the goals outlined in the ‘Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities’ issued during the Group of 7 (G7) Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, in June 2018. She also noted that as part of the G7 Presidency, Canada will host a meeting of G7 Environment, Energy and Oceans Ministers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 19-21 September 2018. The meeting will consider the theme ‘Working Together on Climate Change, Oceans and Clean Energy’ and discuss global climate action, clean growth and sustainable finance, resilient coasts and fisheries, plastic pollution, energy security and clean energy.

Norway said: it organized a week-long capacity building workshop for SIDS to prepare for the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) negotiations; it supports a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative to address the health effects of climate change, particularly on SIDS; and has worked to establish a multi-donor trust fund on marine litter and pollution in the World Bank.

New Zealand reported that it is supporting the trust fund established for the SAMOA Pathway high-level review, and that out of seven SIDS partnerships registered on the SIDS Action Platform, three are now completed. He said New Zealand announced an increase in its development cooperation financing, with most of it allocated to SIDS. Australia remarked that it will allocate $1.3 billion to the Pacific region next year. The Russian Federation said it provided humanitarian assistance, financing and other types of support to Vanuatu and other countries that were impacted by hurricanes Irma and Maria, and is working to strengthen capacity to manage natural disasters.

Seychelles noted that it launched Blue Bonds, and asked for support on setting up the enabling environment, the architecture and the mechanisms to establish the partnerships needed to address SIDS challenges. Belize announced it will phase out single-use plastic products by April 2019, and has revised its legislation to better protect its mangroves.

The Dialogue was organized by DESA and OHRLLS, in close consultation with the Steering Committee on Partnerships for SIDS, co-chaired by Belize and Ireland.

The Portal’s launch fulfills UNESCO’s voluntary commitment made at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, as well as progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

The Ocean Literacy Portal will provide a “one-stop shop for ocean literacy” through sharing resources, information on ocean projects and events based on scientific knowledge. It covers a broad range of ocean topics, from marine litter to marine policy, and its users can search for resources organized by: students; educators; scientists; media; policymakers; and private sector. Portal users can also register for the ‘Ocean Literacy Collaborative Workspace (UNESTEAMS),’ an online collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform that enables users to collaborate with fellow members to co-create and develop joint projects or co-work on topics and share resources.

UNESCO and partners submitted the voluntary commitment titled ‘Ocean Literacy for All: A Global Strategy to Raise the Awareness for the Conservation, Restoration, and Sustainable Use of Our Ocean’ to support implementation of SDG 14, which was the focus of the UN Ocean Conference. According to UNESCO, the ocean literacy encourages more informed and responsible behavior towards the ocean and its resources among all citizens and stakeholders. It encompasses understanding the state of the ocean as well as more in-depth understanding of individual and collective responsibilities towards the seas.

The ocean literacy commitment aims to: encourage cooperation and exchange on ocean education to improve ocean literacy; raise awareness of the two-way interaction between the oceans and peoples’ everyday lives and empower citizens to adjust their everyday behavior; and seek and apply innovative ways to make current and future citizens ocean literate so that they recognize environmental challenges and make informed and responsible decisions related to use of the ocean resources and ocean stewardship.

Also in support of this commitment, UNESCO held an ‘International Workshop on Ocean Literacy’ in December 2017 and plans to release a publication on ocean literacy. The Swedish government has provided financial support for the initiative.

The initial version of the tracker was released in February 2018.



Our World in Data is an online publication produced by the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford in the UK. The SDG Tracker enables tracking at global, regional and national levels, across all 17 SDGs, 169 targets, and 232 indicators included in the global SDG framework. The updated version aims to provide a clearer understanding of the Goals, targets and indicators and the “respective data used to track our progress on them.”

A color-coded matrix on the site displays data availability for all 232 of the official SDG indicators. For SDG 3 (good health and well-being) 20 of the 27 official indicators have recent/good data available.

The Dialogue also considered how UN agencies and other partners could enhance collaboration to support progress towards global biodiversity targets as part of the 2030 Agenda.

The event took place from 2-3 May 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. The Dialogue was organized by EMG in cooperation with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the support of the Swiss Government and the technical support of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

The more than 100 participants from UN agencies, governments, universities, research institutes, NGOs and the private sector explored successful narratives and examined the main challenges of mainstreaming biodiversity in various sectors. They addressed the interdependencies of biodiversity and various components of human security and well-being, including human rights, food, health and water, climate change, disaster risk reduction, trade, migration, and conflict. The dialogue focused also on communication strategies necessary to support biodiversity mainstreaming.

The summary notes that the same way that biodiversity loss threatens the core of human security, weak human security exacerbates biodiversity loss and natural resource degradation: biodiversity can be negatively affected by some actions taken in pursuit of human security, and thereby undermine the wider sustainability of human security itself. Examples include the intensification and expansion of agricultural land to ensure food security and the construction of infrastructure to provide energy and water security. Participants in the event observed that environmental safeguards are increasingly being adopted to mitigate such impacts, while consumers are increasingly becoming aware of such impacts.

Underscoring the need to move from the recognition of the importance of biodiversity to the integration of biodiversity in decision making and practice, participants in the Dialogue provided a series of recommendations. They included:

Ensuring stronger political support for biodiversity within the 2030 Agenda;

Learning to deal with complexities of biodiversity and nature;

Finding effective ways to deliver multiple benefits while addressing trade-offs;

Urgently stepping up the integration of biodiversity in policy and strengthening governance;

Seeking synergies with other issues to integrate global agendas and to explore new nexuses;

Shifting the focus to positive communication and targeted messaging;

Forming strong partnerships with long-term horizons; and by enhancing UN system-wide collaboration and coherent responses on environmental matters.”

Championing and mainstreaming innovative approaches.

Announced at the ICLEI triennial World Congress, the ‘ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024’ identifies pathways towards sustainable urban development.

Convening in Montreal, Canada, from 19-22 June 2018, the meeting, which aimed to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by strengthening action taken in urban areas worldwide, emphasized that building sustainable cities will help realize the SDGs, particularly SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which, participants stressed, can be used as a “central lever” to advance all 17 SDGs.

The ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, which was adopted by the ICLEI Council on 30 May 2018, in advance of the World Congress: provides guidance for action by ICLEI members and network cities; lays out a roadmap for advancing sustainable urban development through 2024, taking into account the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda (NUA); and describes a new model of more inclusive sustainable development governance.

The strategic vision focuses on systems thinking, which highlights the complex relationship among urban systems, and emphasizes an integrated approach to policy and planning. It lays out five interconnected pathways towards 1) low emission, 2) nature-based, 3) circular, 4) resilient and 5) equitable and people-centered development, and supportive policy approaches related to sustainable governance and management, innovation and science, and innovative finance models.

The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

The five pathways aim to cut across sectors and jurisdictional boundaries and create connection points across urban systems to enable local and regional governments to take an integrated approach to sustainable urban development, for example, by determining where equity intersects with resilience or where nature-based solutions can contribute to resilience building. The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

In the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, ICLEI members pledge to: scale up and expand the model of sustainable cities and regions; make sustainability a fundamental and inextricable part of local and global development; tackle the most pressing issues with the long-term interests of citizens in mind; and undertake a collective effort for global change across all sectors and levels of government.

More specifically, the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024 aims to, inter alia: promote 100% renewable energy; support industrial legacy in cities transitioning to sustainable economies; lead the transition to a green economy through sustainable public procurement networks; connect climate action to urban development and engage local and regional governments in making Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) fit for the Paris Agreement; and lead the implementation of global biodiversity targets at the city and regional levels.

More than 1,000 participants attended the congress, representing local, regional and national governments, international agencies, the private sector, academia, community groups and other partners.

The ICLEI World Congress, first held in 1990, takes place every three years to showcase the efforts of local and regional governments to advance sustainable urban development. ICLEI is a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions in over 100 countries committed to sustainable development, which acts as a bridge between local and regional governments worldwide.

The Summit reflected on synergies between Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda and supported efforts to promote women’s empowerment and tackle corruption.

The 31st ordinary session of the AU convened in Nouakchott, Mauritania, from 25 June to 2 July 2018, under the theme ‘Winning the Fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation.’ The Summit included the 36th Ordinary Session of the Permanent Representatives’ Committee, the 33rd Ordinary Session of the Executive Council, the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of States and Government of the AU.

On the AfCFTA, 49 out of the AU’s 55 member States have signed the agreement establishing the AfCFTA. Chad, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Ghana, Kenya, Niger and Rwanda have ratified the AfCFTA. Participants adopted five priority sectors: transport; communication; finance; tourism; and business. Leaders urged member States who have not yet done so to sign and ratify the agreement and urged member States to abstain from entering into bilateral trading agreements until after the AfCFTA enters into force.

The Assembly approved the AUDA’s establishment as the AU’s technical body and requested the AU Commission to develop a statute for AUDA for adoption at the January 2019 Summit. The Assembly recognized the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency as the organization responsible for implementation of Africa’s Agenda 2063 and implementation of various African development programmes and initiatives. The Assembly agreed the implementation of African development programmes and initiatives would transition from NEPAD to AUDA.

During the opening session, President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, who also serves as the AU Chair, described partnership as the common thread in the Summit’s deliberations. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed stressed sustainable development as the center of the UN’s strategic partnership with the AU. She observed that Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “share a common vision” and provide the basis for the AU-UN Partnership framework for development. She called for aligning policy, programming and accountability on the agendas to amplify impact at regional and country levels.

Mohammed reflected that, in spite of huge challenges, Africa is making “continuous progress”, as evidenced by declining child and maternal mortality, increasing access to all levels of education and increasing decision-making roles held by women, in line with SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality). She said the AU Great Green Wall can protect millions of people from climate change and desertification impacts while integrating renewable energy and investments in value chains, in line with SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land).

On peace, security and migration, Mohammed praised Africa as a “generous humanitarian actor,” describing the continent as one of the “most reliable contributors” to UN peacekeeping operations. She further noted that Africa hosts more than one-quarter of the world’s refugees and displaced people, showing “a solidarity that is often missing elsewhere.” AUC Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat stressed the importance of the free movement of persons, saying Africans should not “be foreigners on their own continent.” He urged member States to ratify the AU Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment to ensure that Africans are treated with dignity and respect across the continent.

The Summit also addressed reports on peace and security and progress on reducing armed conflicts in Africa in line with the ‘AU Master Roadmap on Practical Steps to Silence the Guns in Africa by 2020,’ one of the key projects of Agenda 2063. Participants commended Zambia and Zimbabwe for being the first countries to submit written reports on their implementation of the Roadmap and called on member States to emulate their example.

A panel discussion on corruption focused on evaluating Africa’s progress in fighting corruption and developing additional strategies to tackle it. The Assembly encouraged member States to tackle illicit financial flows, invest in the demographic dividend and strengthen national anti-corruption agencies. Mahamat called on governments to follow up on the recommendations of the Tabi Mebki Panel on illicit financial flows, underscoring the potential contribution of these lost resources to finance Africa’s development.

On SDG 5, Kagame and European Union (EU) Commissioner Mimica co-hosted a joint AU-EU ‘Women in Power’ side-event on the role of women in driving political, social and economic development. Participants supported accelerating efforts towards gender equality and women’s empowerment, stressing such progress as fundamental to achieving all the SDGs.

The Summit also addressed, inter alia: the AU budget, which has been reduced by 12% compared to 2018 in line with management effectiveness reforms; a common position on the UN high-level meeting on Tuberculous; and appointments. The Summit designated the theme for the 2019 Summit as the ‘Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons in Africa: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement.’ [AU Press Release on Opening] [AU Press Release on Key Conclusions] [AU Press Release on Gender Equality Side Event] [President Kagame Statement] [UN Deputy Secretary-General Statement]","6 July 2018: Heads of State and Government attending the 31st ordinary session of the African Union (AU) discussed the AU institutional reforms, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the establishment of the AU Development Agency (AUDA), and peace and security, among other topics.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

The study titled, ‘Wood Energy in the ECE Region: Data, Trends and Outlook in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and North America,’ highlights wood energy as the “overlooked renewable energy giant of the world.”

The report discusses types of wood energy fuels such as firewood, sources and users, policy instruments that support and hinder use, and ways to sustainably source wood.

According to the study, wood energy provides the majority of total energy supply in many developing countries, and nearly 25% in some developed countries, such as in Europe, where it is the leading renewable energy source. The report explains that wood pellets: are transforming wood use for heat and power generation in the UNECE region; are more energy-dense than traditional firewood; and support employment in the region’s forest sector through their production and distribution.

The report notes that wood energy can be stored, and provides energy without sun or wind. However, it can also lead to indoor and outdoor pollution if used inefficiently, and fuel wood harvesting can degrade forests without sustainable practices. Application of best practices to sourcing and processing can ensure that wood energy is clean and sustainable. For example, improved stoves and fuels can reduce fine particle emissions from traditional open fireplaces by more than 95%.

Improved stoves and fuels can reduce fine particle emissions from traditional open fireplaces by more than 95%.

In addition, wood energy use: can help mitigate climate change if used as a substitute for fossil fuels and if it reduces carbon emissions through sequestration; is scalable from small-scale residential units to large-scale industrial settings; and can support resilient and secure energy systems, as well as livelihoods across the UNECE region.

The report also, inter alia: describes how social, economic and political trends and developments may impact on wood energy use and sustainable production; includes statistics on wood energy markets across the UNECE region; helps bridge information about the forest and energy sectors; provides information on the role of wood energy in a range of sectors to support green economy strategies; and outlines commercial wood energy uses.

The report describes the role of public policy in helping to promote renewable energies, energy diversification, energy efficiency and security, and forest health, among others. As public policies influencing wood energy supply chains vary among UNECE member States, efforts are underway to streamline policy implementation towards more efficient outcomes. In addition, the report recommends that public policies affecting wood energy markets ensure, inter alia, stakeholder inclusiveness, incremental and permanence of targets, uniformity in incentives, flexibility in their application, and tailoring to local conditions.

The Joint UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section developed the report, with support from the Government of Finland and the UNECE/FAO Team of Specialists on Wood Energy.

The groups launched the ‘UN Biodiversity Lab’ at the 22nd meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA 22).

According to UNDP, many countries lack access to geospatial data because of limited technical capacity. The UN Biodiversity Lab will address this limitation by providing spatial data via a free, cloud-based tool that users can access to inform conservation decision-making and support monitoring and reporting. The Lab’s website includes stories of how inclusion of spatial data in biodiversity and conservation planning has informed governments’ dialogue, policy and monitoring. For instance, Ecuador used spatial data to address deforestation, and South Africa protected coastal and marine resources after using open spatial data to inform stakeholder discussions.

Data covers protected areas, species, climate, land, marine areas, human impacts on natural systems and socio-economic data.

The Lab includes spatial data on protected areas, endangered species, climate and carbon, land cover, marine areas, human impacts on natural systems and socio-economic data. Data on ecosystem services, natural hazards and restoration will be added in the future. Going forward, the Lab is also expected to incorporate automated monitoring using artificial intelligence (AI).

At the launch event at SBSTTA 22 in Montreal, Canada, on 5 July 2018, UNDP and UNEP challenged the 196 Parties to the CBD to “double the number of maps used in their national progress reports to the CBD.” UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim described the Lab as “a vital part of our ongoing efforts to build a digital ecosystem of planetary data that is accurate and easy to use by countries, companies and citizens” in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The creation of the UN Biodiversity Lab aligns with calls for innovative tools to monitor conservation trends and for enhanced access to big data for sustainable development, such as in the ‘Nature for Development Declaration on Spatial Data.’ According to CBD Executive Secretary Cristiana Pașca Palmer, the Lab can “enable Parties to utilize spatial data to deliver on their commitments to the CBD and to fundamentally transform biodiversity conservation and sustainable use decision making and reporting.”

The UN Biodiversity Lab uses spatial data from UN agencies, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC), the Global Resource Information Database (GRID-Geneva), the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and others.

Source: Fred Duhoe

The Volta Region as unofficially partitioned by its indigenes into Northern, Central and Southern parts have over the years engaged predominantly in small-scale farming.



The land up north and central parts are considered much fertile, but in a rather sharp contrast, the porous sandy soil found in the southern parts are usually nourished with animal composts coupled with irrigation in order to attain fertility to grow crops.



Food crops produced up north and central of the region notably are tubers of yam, maize, pepper, cassava, tomato, cocoa etc.



The southern part produces shallots, tomato, carrots etc. Fishing is one of the main occupation of the people but has in recent times dwindled due to depleted fish stock in the sea.



After a successive annual celebration of national farmers day for the 33rd time, Volta happened to gain it for four (4) times.



In 1986, 1991, 2004 and 2013, farmers from the Central parts of the region (Akatsi, Juapong, Ho and Sogakope) respectively succeeded as the Best National farmers.



The Southern and Northern part are yet to attain this great achievement of national awards in spite of their tremendous effort in feeding the nation Ghana in their very own way. Most farmers have at least been acknowledged at the various Regional and District levels over the years.



Challenges affecting the people of the Southern part remains the battle for dry lands as urbanization increases and the tidal waves and erosion from the sea makes situations even worse.



They have been able to invest their energy in irrigating mechanically and manually, their crops almost every day.



For the 33rd time of awarding hard work and acknowledging efforts of farmers at the national level, farmers in the Volta Region have had their fair share as the statistics on the ministry of Agriculture website indicates. The region is at par with Western and Greater Accra regions with 4 winners of the prestigious annual awards. Northern and Upper-West regions are the least national awardees as 2 time winners each, while the Ashanti leads for the 5th time last year, 2017.



Engaging some farmers in the region, they decried among other things, land acquisition for large-scale farming as their major issues as custodians of land mounts pressure on them after some lease period of time. Some chiefs are unwilling to release their lands on favorable terms of conditions for commercial farming.



The second topmost agenda of the United Nations with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to; ""End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture — source;. – United Nations’ website.



To achieve these goals by 2030, farmers in the Volta Region must avail themselves to improve yields and manage post-harvest losses. This can be done in collaboration with government on its flagship programs of “Planting for Food and Jobs and 1District; 1Factory (1D1F), which needs total commitment and proper arrangements in allocating resources.



Volta Region been one of Ghana’s food hub has 20,570km2 (7,940sq ml) as its area coverage with a population of about 2,118,252 according to the 2010 population census with majority of the demographics been youth.



Over the years, the people of Agotime Ziope have petitioned government to come to their aid to salvage their postharvest losses of tomatoes. Their produce (tomato) have to be sold cheaply to recoup part of their yearly farming investments. They have asked successive governments to establish a tomato factory in the locality but this has not materialized.



“Our desire and attempt to produce tomato in large quantity will only be in futility when there is no factory to process it. Tomato is perishable and there must be a processing plant to turn it into paste. This we the youth currently unemployed and are not in school are willing to do for a living but until government come to build a factory, we would prefer riding motorbikes to make a living” a farmer said in an interview.



The people of Mafi Kumase in the Central Tongu District have complained bitterly about their produce been priced cheaply since there is no measuring scale for their gari. The only gari factory available on visit by Fred Duhoe was visibly covered in weeds and has become a place of convenience for locals around.



“From the planting stage, through harvesting and processing of cassava is quite tedious yet people come to take advantage of our gari and price it the way they like. We are certainly not making any profit out of cassava and gari but we have no option since that’s what puts food on our table” a local reveals in an interview with Fred Duhoe.



The people of Dambai and its environs due to bad roads have lost much of their yam produce before it reaches the cities.



The people of Dzodze produce palm fruits in large quantity while the people of Keta and its environs feed the nation with some amount of fish and salt alongside the vegetables. The people of Biakoye, Hohoe and Jasikan in their efforts feed the nation with maize, rice, mango etc.



The people of Kadjebi produce yam and groundnut in large quantity when a favorable average weather temperature of about 250C remains fairly stable throughout the season.



With the current technological trends in Agriculture, there is always a bumper harvest when there is fairly good weather conditions but most unfortunately, the food produced doesn’t last longer due to over-reliance of farmers on pesticides, weedicides and fertilizers.



In almost the past decade, Agriculture Science was a subject studied in the basic schools of Ghana while some schools have farms for practical.



Interacting with some idling youth of school going age in Ho, they revealed, “Farming is not attractive since they have no knowledge about the subject from school”.



The bottom line is, if this peasant farmers are given the requisite education on new trends of farming with its accompanied technological preservation methods, Ghana hope to be secured in terms of food security and prices of goods will remain relatively low.



The Adidome Farm Institute at Adidome in the Central Tongu District and the Ohawu Agric College at Abor in the Akatsi North District are among the specifically designated colleges for agriculture studies in the Volta Region which could help upgrade the knowledge of local farmers.","After a successive annual celebration of national farmers day for the 33rd time, Volta happened to gain it for four (4) times.
In 1986, 1991, 2004 and 2013, farmers from the Central parts of the region (Akatsi, Juapong, Ho and Sogakope) respectively succeeded as the Best National farmers.
To achieve these goals by 2030, farmers in the Volta Region must avail themselves to improve yields and manage post-harvest losses.
Their produce (tomato) have to be sold cheaply to recoup part of their yearly farming investments.

Japanese Governmental Efforts toward the SDGs and 'SDGs Future Cities'

In response to the United Nations' adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the Japanese government established a cabinet body, the SDGs Promotion Headquarters (below, ""the Headquarters"") in May 2016. Headed by the Prime Minister and composed of all of Japan's ministers of state, the Headquarters meets semiannually to ensure a whole-government approach to achieving the SDGs effectively.

In the SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles spelled out by the Headquarters, Japan's vision is to ""Become a leader toward a future where economic, social and environmental improvements are attained in an integrated, sustainable and resilient manner while leaving no one behind."" The Japanese government has identified eight priority areas out of the 17 SDGs.

Empowerment of all people Achievement of good health and longevity Creating growth markets, revitalizing rural areas, and promoting science, technology and innovation Sustainable and resilient land use, promoting quality infrastructure Energy conservation, renewable energy, climate change countermeasures, and sound material-cycle society Conservation of the environment, including biodiversity, forests and the oceans Achieving peaceful, safe and secure societies Strengthening the means and frameworks for the implementation of the SDGs

The SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles also indicate the following three directions of Japan's SDG models to transform companies, regional communities and society through promotion of the SDGs and thereby achieve economic growth and spread it further to the rest of the world.

Promotion of Society 5.0, which is interlocked with the SDGs Regional vitalization driven by the SDGs and creation of resilient, environmentally friendly, attractive communities Empowerment of future generations and women to bear responsibility for the SDGs

Japan faces many problems, including aging and depopulation, especially in rural areas, so regional revitalization has become a key word. In line with this, as a project for local government SDG promotion toward regional revitalization, the national government is inviting local governments to propose projects for achieving the SDGs. It is also selecting local governments that have proposed excellent projects as SDGs Future Cities, with strong support from a taskforce of ministries and agencies involved in local government SDG promotion.

On June 15, 2018, the Cabinet Office announced that 29 local governments had been selected as SDGs Future Cities.

https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/tiiki/kankyo/teian/pdf/result01.pdf (Japanese)

The following 29 local governments were selected as SDGs Future Cities.

Hokkaido Prefecture; Sapporo in Hokkaido; Niseko in Hokkaido; Shimokawa in Hokkaido; Higashi Matsushima in Miyagi; Semboku in Akita; Iide in Yamagata; Tsukuba in Ibaraki; Kanagawa Prefecture, Yokohama in Kanagawa; Kamakura in Kanagawa; Toyama City in Toyama; Suzu in Ishikawa; Hakusan in Ishikawa, Nagano Prefecture, Shizuoka City in Shizuoka; Hamamatsu in Shizuoka; Toyota in Aichi; Shima in Mie; Sakai in Osaka; Totsukawa in Nara; Okayama City in Okayama; Maniwa in Okayama; Hiroshima Prefecture; Ube in Yamaguchi; Kamikatsu in Tokushima; Kitakyushu in Fukuoka; Iki in Nagasaki; and Oguni in Kumamoto.

The national government is also selecting some projects proposed by the SDGs Future Cities as Local Government SDG Model Projects for funding. Ten projects proposed by the following ten local governments out of the 29 have been selected as Local Government SDGs Model Projects.

Niseko in Hokkaido; Shimokawa in Hokkaido; Kanagawa Prefecture; Yokohama in Kanagawa; Kamakura in Kanagawa; Toyama City in Toyama; Maniwa in Okayama; Kitakyushu in Fukuoka; Iki in Nagasaki; and Oguni in Kumamoto.

To commend companies and other organizations for their excellent efforts to contribute toward achieving the SDGs, the Headquarters established the Japan SDGs Awards. Shimokawa in Hokkaido handily won the Prime Minister Award at the 1st Japan SDGs Awards, announced in December 2017.

SDG-Based Community Building in Shimokawa

Shimokawa, Hokkaido, where I have been helping with community building since last year, is one of the leading SDGs local governments in Japan; it has not only won an SDGs Award but has also been selected as a SDGs Future City and a project proposed by the town has been selected as a Local Government SDGs Model Project.

The town of Shimokawa is located in the central northern part of Hokkaido, and has a population of about 3,300 in an area of 644.2 square kilometers -- almost same as the total area of Tokyo's 23 wards. With about 90 percent of it forested, the town's main industries are forestry and agriculture. Situated in a heavy snowfall area, where the temperature drops to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius in winter, Shimokawa has produced many ski jumpers, including the legendary Noriaki Kasai.

The town was selected as an Eco-Model City and a Future City (two environmental city programs run by the Japanese government) in the past and has been acclaimed for its continuous efforts in proactive town development. In recent years, an increasing number of people have relocated there from urban areas, putting a brake on depopulation, which would have worsened otherwise. Its path from the beginning, however, has not been that smooth.

After being settled in 1901, Shimokawa's population increased as agriculture, forestry and mining were developed and railway service started in the area. In 1949, the municipality's status changed from ""village"" to ""town."" Though its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1960, soon afterward it started to decrease due to declines in its main industries (agriculture, forestry and mining). Railway service was discontinued, further accelerating the town's depopulation (to about 3,300 currently).

""We cannot just let it happen!"" ""We should do something!"" The town residents, sharing a sense of crisis, began working hard to carry out various projects, drawing on their creativity. Thanks to their efforts, Shimokawa has become an exciting, energetic, attractive town that I always look forward to visiting.

Yet the town people still face a sense of crisis, saying, ""We have to keep moving forward; otherwise we will spiral into decline."" Out of this sense of crisis, the town is trying to pursue town development more proactively. Specifically, as of 2018, the town has been pushing forward with improved town development for the two years since 2017 by integrating the SDGs in the formulation process of its Comprehensive Plan, the town's highest level plan.

In September 2017, the ""SDGs Future City Task Force"" was established within the Shimokawa Town Comprehensive Plan Council. This task force, consisting of ten resident committee members and town officials, has served as a base organization for the process of creating a vision of Shimokawa in 2030 and formalizing that vision. I helped design and facilitate the process.

The specific process was as follows: First we used ""backcasting,"" an approach for considering ""how you want to be at a particular time in the future,"" setting aside current realities and all restrictions, to create a vision of the town in 2030. Next, we used ""system thinking,"" an approach for creating real transformations by understanding the links and interactions among various factors that can produce positive cycles to help the town realize its vision. Then, the task force went to work to come up with concrete measures and projects that would actually produce positive cycles. The task force met 13 times in total during the period from September 2017 to April 2018.

The process was made as open as possible, and this more than anything else came to characterize Shimokawa's vision creation work. In this type of work, the conventional approach would have been to involve only town officials and a few of the town's resident in creating the vision. Instead, the task force members, who are town residents themselves, organized a meeting to write public comments together with other residents after explaining the vision they had created. They later organized another meeting to present the vision they had finalized after incorporating the public comments.

In the course of this half-year process, each task force member was assigned individual ""homework."" They had to identify people who had not been present but were important for the future of this town, interview them to learn about their visions for the town, and consider the matter further based on the results gathered from other members. In addition, a morning ""girls meeting"" was organized to collect opinions about town development and current issues from mothers who were busy taking care of children and could not attend evening meetings. Study sessions for the town council members on the SDGs and community building were also held a full three times.

In this way, through a careful process of consideration, Shimokawa has set seven goals for what it wants to become:

(1) A town where citizens continue striving together -- embodying the town's own values, such as the fortitude to keep facing crisis and hardship, as well as broad-mindedness and tolerance for embracing diverse people and values

(2) A town where nobody is left behind -- enabling all of its citizens to continue to expand their possibilities, have a place where they belong, and play a role so as to live a healthy and meaningful life

(3) A town where humans, resources, and money are cycled in a sustainable manner -- becoming independent and autonomous by achieving the following: an enduring cycle and perpetuation of humans, natural resources (e.g., forests and water) and money; further growth of agriculture, forestry and other industries; and local production of food, wood, energy, etc. for local consumption

(4) A town where citizens can care for each other like a family -- enabling its citizens to continue to live safely with peace of mind by placing importance on developing human-to-human relationships, and caring for and supporting each other

(5) A town where culture and resources handed down from generation to generation are esteemed while new value is created -- preserving things that are old but valuable while creating new value -- a practice for which a new popular term was coined recently in Japan: Onkokishin

(6) A town regarded as a role model by other municipalities around the world -- contributing to the achievement of a decarbonized society (under Paris Agreement) and globally sustainable development (under the SDGs) by enhancing and deepening the town's past efforts

(7) A town bringing smiles to children and nurturing happiness for future generations -- caring about all future generations and nurturing them throughout the entire region, so that children can grow cheerfully and freely

In the materials presented for the award, logos indicating goals corresponding to each of the 17 SDGs were attached to each section of the town's goals. What is significant about the SDGs initiative, however, is not classifying players' efforts into one or another of the 17 goals as if they were 17 small boxes and attaching corresponding logos to them. I think what is really important is, first of all, for the local people to visualize a desirable town with a sense of reality and subjectivity, then to check for any missing aspects using the SDGs framework, and finally to perceive the 17 goals not as individualized goals but as goals mutually connected.

Since Shimokawa is an inland town, the local people there are usually not conscious of the ocean. For that reason, initially there were few opinions about Goal 14 (life below water) of the SDGs. Later, though, they began thinking about the links between the forest, their lives and the ocean, and expressing various opinions about them. In this way, providing awareness of ""links"" that people usually do not consider may be one way utilizing the SDGs framework can be effective.

As mentioned above, the town provides opportunities for considering how the SDGs relate to oneself not only to the task force members but also to people in a variety of positions, helping create broader perspectives. For instance, several members of the town council asked questions regarding the SDGs at a recent general inquiry session. Also, a routine test at the town's junior high school included questions on the SDGs. This is wonderful, isn't it!

The town identifies the following four aspects as advantages of incorporating the SDGs into its comprehensive town development plan, and intends to use them as a tool for its future development.

Discovering or being aware of new challenges by reconsidering the region in light the 17 goals Developing a high-quality approach for community building by looking at the current situation from the perspective of a desirable future, and considering and adopting measures to achieve such a desirable future Establishing a system to develop the town through collaboration with a wide variety of people Communicating the town's attractiveness and potentials within and outside Japan, using the SDGs framework, to boost public perception of the town and attract settlers, visitors, businesses, investment and other involvement in the town

In helping the town develop I came to realize the effectiveness of using the SDGs framework to help even small local towns consider their own community development from a global viewpoint and understand interrelatedness. In view of this, for future community building, backcasting, systems thinking, and the SDGs are certain to be the ""three sacred treasures""!

Even non-economists can gather from this statement that creating an efficient market-based mechanism to determine a price on carbon is no easy task. While many emissions trading schemes (ETS) that have been implemented around the world over the last decade are proof that market-based pricing mechanisms can work, they have also revealed that concerns about their effectiveness in providing a long-term incentive to invest in climate mitigation were well founded.

One such concern is that an ETS may result in a price that is too low or too volatile to act as a meaningful incentive. The EU ETS has often been cited as an example of this problem with critics noting that the average price that resulted in past years is not meaningful to nudge large emitters into accelerated mitigation action. This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

Is a Minimum Price on Carbon Desirable?

To address concerns around the effectiveness of the EU ETS, some EU Member States are considering introducing additional measures, such as an EU-wide or national carbon pricing floors (CPFs) that would guarantee a minimum price on carbon emissions for all market participants.

Germany and France for example agreed, in a Joint Declaration on further cooperation in Europe, to develop an ‘EU Strategy 2050’ for the long-term transformation towards carbon neutrality. The countries propose a high-level ministerial working group on climate change to build a common view on the energy transition as well as tools for triggering sustainable finance and economic incentives, including carbon pricing issues. [German Government Press Release: Meseberg Declaration – Renewing Europe’s promises of security and prosperity]

CPFs that apply to an entire ETS have been implemented using various mechanisms, including:

an auction reserve price that creates a minimum price below which a government withholds a number of allowances from sale;

a top-up payment or carbon price that is designed either as a tax that makes up the difference between the CPF level and the ETS allowance price or as a fixed price which is added to it;

or a system of permit buybacks, where the market operator commits to buying back permits at the floor price.

A key question for regional markets, such as the EU ETS, is whether national and regional prices can coexist. Under a national carbon floor pricing mechanism, a country would be allowed to set a minimum price for emissions that may or may not be higher than the supra-national ETS market price. Several institutions have recently published opposing views on this question.

Yes, if the Conditions are Right.

A study by the Cambridge Energy Research Group entitled “When is carbon pricing desirable?” supports the introduction of an EU-wide power sector CPF. The paper recommends that such a CPF be designed as a carbon levy to “top up” the European Emission Allowances (EUA) price to €25–30/tCO2, rising at 3–5% annually above the rate of inflation, at least until 2030.

The authors argue that this approach would not only address the risk of a “too low” carbon price, but also provide longer-term prices and bring forward low-carbon investment by guaranteeing a minimum return to emissions reductions. They further suggest the delivery of climate benefits through a CPF would be enhanced by the new market stability reserve (MSR) of the EU ETS. The MSR, which will begin to operate in January 2019, will withhold from the market 24% of the calculated EUA oversupply each year from 2019-2023, and 12% of the surplus each year thereafter. From 2023, if the MSR volume exceeds the EUA volume auctioned in the previous year, this excess will be ‘invalidated’ or removed from the MSR. This cancellation mechanism is expected to remove a substantial number of EUAs.

The research group also recognizes that national CPFs are easier to implement than an EU-wide CPF, but notes they pose the risk of intra-EU trade distortions. In addition, a national CPF may need to be accompanied by an emissions performance standard to enhance durability. [Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group Paper “When is carbon pricing desirable?”]

No, because it Increases Costs and Risks of Carbon Leakage

Taking a contrasting view, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) called on EU Member States to refrain from introducing national CPFs or taxes. Focusing on several industry sectors in addition to the power sector, IETA cautions such measures would lead to competitive distortions, negatively impact industrial low carbon investment strategies and reduce the EU ETS’s efficiency. The authors emphasize the risk of carbon leakage from the country imposing the national mechanism and the risk of creating a barrier to linking with ETS in other jurisdictions. They suggest instead of introducing additional taxes, Member States should assess the potential to extend coverage of the EU ETS to additional sectors and gases.

If Member States do decide to introduce additional carbon price measures, IETA recommends such measures be temporary, arguing that the system absorbs accumulated surplus through the MSR. They advise member states: ensure a high degree of coordination to minimize market distortions and fragmentation; transparently quantify their impact in terms of emission reductions within the scope of the EU ETS; and voluntarily cancel an adequate amount of allowances from their auction volumes in order to mitigate the impact of the measure on the functioning of the EU ETS. [IETA Position Paper]

Healthy Discourse Contributes to Improvements of Carbon Markets

These diverging positions on CPFs show that fixing the shortcomings of current carbon market mechanisms won’t be easy. On the other hand, the debate is also proof that both sides share an interest in improving the effectiveness of the EU ETS. In medicine, treatments are reviewed for improvements, and where such are not observed other treatments, including in combination, are tried aiming at increasing effectiveness and success. In a similar way, policy debates around measures to address climate change often reveal diverging views and heterogeneous preferences of experts and governments. While coming to an agreement may take some time, the commitment to a healthy, evidence-based debate is an encouraging sign that carbon mechanisms are maturing into an effective tool that will ultimately overcome the barriers predicted by economists.","This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

179,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation’,"Reviewing the original Hotel Transylvania back in 2012, I remarked that, by the time Adam Sandler’s Dracula started rapping at the denouement, “I was dying for a Van Helsing to come in and clean house.”

That didn’t happen, of course, so in due course we got Hotel Transylvania 2, in which Dracula’s pixieish undead daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) married her bohemian human boyfriend Johnny (Andy Samberg) and gave birth to a half-undead son named Dennis (the improbably named Asher Blinkoff).

But now, at last, there’s a Van Helsing in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. Two, in fact.

Jim Gaffigan voices the obsessive monster-hunter Abraham Van Helsing, who, in a prologue starting on a train in 1897 and proceeding to a montage of crashing and burning, pursues his chosen vocation of would-be vampire slayer with all the tenacity — and all the success, if not the slapstick logic — of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner.

Then there’s Abraham’s great-granddaughter, Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn), who has more or less inherited the family trade and is out to succeed where her great-grandfather failed.

At this point, though, it’s clear that the Van Helsings are fighting a lost cause.

The original Hotel Transylvania took place in the shadow of centuries of alienation between monsters and humans, at least insofar as the latter were even aware of the existence of the former. Historically, it seems humans had persecuted monsters rather than the reverse; Drac, who never drinks human blood, lost his wife in an attack by an angry human mob and was bitterly anti-human as a result.

But Mavis’ open-minded curiosity about humans was clearly a harbinger of a more tolerant future — and in time, Drac realized that human society was evolving beyond its past prejudices.

In the first sequel, the monster community came out of the shadows and found the human world generally ready to welcome them. There were holdouts, of course, like Drac’s traditionally human-hating father, Vlad, voiced by Mel Brooks. In general, though, both sides were ready to let go of the hate.

Van Helsing is an old-school hater on the human side who will, of course, learn by the end to let go of the hate, too. This is such a foregone conclusion that as early as that 1897 prologue Drac is already mocking Van Helsing for his hopeless crusade and urging him to “let go of the hate,” which seems more progressive and less bitter than the Drac we met in the original movie. (Drac’s monster resort was founded a year later, in 1898. No, I have not seen any of these films more than once and don’t know the franchise that well. I’m looking at transcripts on the internet.)

Like Mavis in the first film, Ericka has been brought up to hate the other side, and, while she has been effectively brainwashed in a way Mavis never was, Ericka may not quite be the true believer grandfather is.

Somehow the Van Helsings lay a trap for Drac, whom Mavis believes is overworked and needs a vacation. The truth is that Drac is lonely after centuries of widowerhood and doesn’t believe he can connect with someone new, since the “Zing” — magical monster love at first sight — comes only once in a lifetime, or so we’ve been told since the first film.

Then Mavis books a monster cruise for them and all their family and friends, including Kevin James’ Frankenstein, David Spade’s Invisible Man and Keegan-Michael Key’s Mummy. The moment Drac lays eyes on the cruise ship’s female captain, he knows it’s possible to “zing” again. (“Zing” started out as a noun but was quickly verbified, as “Mavis and Johnny zinged.”)

The catch is that the captain is Ericka Van Helsing, and the ship belongs to her and her great-grandfather (or what’s left of him, after all that opening crashing and burning). See, this is the trap, though why the Van Helsings happen to own an ocean liner and then their archenemy goes on a cruise … sorry, I overthought that one.

Overthinking the plot, I’ll apologize for. Themes are another matter.

I found the first film’s “humans are the real monsters” theme tiresome, although in fairness the movie was really about overcoming mutual prejudice, and the premise was that neither humans nor monsters were truly the monsters the other side thought.

The monsters could be understood allegorically as a misunderstood invisible minority, although in that case the movie would seem to be saying that the minority needed to let go of their suspicions and recognize that the majority was ready to accept them, which I’m not sure is a message the filmmakers would have intended.

The target audience, of course, won’t be paying much attention to these themes of prejudice and tolerance. They’ll be laughing at gags like Drac trying to talk to a smartphone that mishears everything he says or little Dennis and his young werewolf gal pal Winnie (Sadie Sandler) trying to disguise Dennis’ elephant-sized puppy Tinkles with a trenchcoat and a tiny hat.

Adults may chuckle at a few gags, including a chupacabra joke and the weariness of Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon’s werewolf couple who are overwhelmed with their large litter.

Still, just because it’s a dumb kiddie film doesn’t mean the ideas don’t matter. Hotel Transylvania told us that the “Zing” comes once in a lifetime, and when it hits it’s for life (whatever “life” means for vampires and mummies and walking skeletons). This is the kind of “Someday my prince will come” romanticism for which Disney has been doing penance in updated fairy tales like Frozen and Moana.

I’m not thrilled about the lack of worthy romantic leading men in recent Hollywood animation, but I prefer the theme in Frozen, about needing to get to know someone before deciding to get married, to this series’ magical, inexorable “Zing” moment.

In Hotel Transylvania, Mavis worried that maybe the “Zing” between her and Jonathan was only on her side, not his. (Internet transcript, I promise.)

This threequel makes it clear that “zinging” is destiny, and even if it strikes one person before the other, it’s still meant to be. So if Drac “zinged” when he saw Ericka, but Ericka didn’t “zing” back, Drac must still pursue her, even if she told him in so many words that she could never be with a monster. In the real world this translates to harassment and stalking. (Are male vampires who love human women ever not stalkerish?)

All three Hotel Transylvania movies were directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, most celebrated for small-screen fare like Samurai Jack and Dexter’s Laboratory. His often frenetic style and one-dimensional characters work well in short bursts on the small screen, but pall at feature length. Drac remains a dull protagonist, too lacking in self-awareness or substance for his father-daughter relationship with Mavis to have the appeal it should.

The animation is energetic and character design remains a strength. A race of fish-men, including a cruise host named Stan (Chris Parnell), are so visually striking they look like they belong in another movie, such as Rango.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for action to end poverty, protect the planet, improve health, education, and ensuring that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

""When we look across the SDGs right now, Asia-Pacific as a whole is on track to meet only one of the 17 SDGs. We are only going to meet the SDG on education.

""While that is a great achievement -- universal education in a region as vast as the Asia-Pacific -- it is not enough,"" UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) Deputy Executive Secretary Kaveh Zahedi told PTI here.

Zahedi was in New York to participate in the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development at UN headquarters last week that reviewed progress towards several of the SDGs.

As nations across the world implement national development programmes in line with development goals, the UN official emphasised that success in the SDGs will in large part depend on its success in India.

He noted that the success on the Millennium Development Goals, to some degree, could be attributed to China's poverty reduction and its efforts in lifting millions out of poverty.

""We are highly reliant on India's success to demonstrate the global success on achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is going to depend on ambition and vision at the highest level of government and also depends on money and investment,"" he said.

Zahedi raised concern over the region ""moving backwards"" on parameters of inequality besides the emerging ""digital divide"" within and between countries.

""The region is becoming more unequal. Not only are we not going to achieve the SDGs, we are moving in the wrong direction. I don't think any of the countries will say that they are hundred per cent on the track to meet SDGs just yet,"" he said.

He noted that inequality in the region is not just in income and wealth, but also in terms of access to vital services like education, health, social protection, environmental degradation and impact of disasters.

""We also see a digital divide emerging within countries and between countries, which, in a way, is setting the pattern for future inequality when people will rely on mobile, 3G services to access education, health services,"" he said.

Referring specifically to the SDG on access to affordable and clean energy, he said while in the past 20 years access to energy has increased, access to clean fuel, especially clean cooking fuel, has not. About 2.2 billion people in the Asia Pacific region still cook with traditional bio mass fuel and a majority of those people live in China and India, he noted.

Zahedi, however, lauded India's efforts towards increasing the renewable energy component in its overall energy mix. India is undertaking the transformation of its energy mix towards renewable energy, with particular emphasis on expanding the use of solar and wind power, including off-grid.

By 2022, India plans to produce 175 GW of renewable energy that will include 100 GW of solar power. The rate of expansion in this sector in India is highest in the world.

India has also partnered with France and other countries to launch the International Solar Alliance as a tangible contribution to the ongoing collective global efforts on climate action. More than 60 countries have already joined this alliance, which has now been registered at the UN as a multilateral treaty.

""Countries need to set a vision and ambition for themselves. India has done that (in the energy field). From the 100 GW of solar ambition by 2022 to putting in place the solar alliance, it is a statement of intent from India that is absolutely vital,"" he said.

Zahedi also said that countries need to increase their investments if they are to achieve the SDGs.

""Regionally, we need an investment of up to 1.7 billion dollars to achieve universal access to energy. It's an extraordinary investment that is needed but it is not happening right now. We see that the major investments are not aligned with the SDGs,"" he said.

Highlighting an urgent need for nations to speed up development efforts, he said economic growth alone will not bring the results that the countries are seeking.

""Just economic growth will not help with sustainable and inclusive development. If we have a challenge when it comes to inequality, we cannot just grow out of that problem. We need to invest in overcoming that problem, we need to invest in education, healthcare, reducing the vulnerability of various populations and those that constantly get dragged back into poverty after each financial crisis and extreme weather events,"" he said.

""The message is that economic growth alone really will not resolve our problems and has not resolved our problems. It is important but it is not enough. We have to see investments in the SDGs, in building the social safeguards, in building the resilience that will bring ultimately the SDGs success,"" he said.

183,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/why-nigeria-requires-5bn-water-sector-investments-to-meet-sdg-targets/,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vanguard,Why Nigeria requires $5bn water sector investments to meet SDG targets,"Kindly Share This Story:

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

Co-published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and its partners as part of the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, the report analyzes data on the levels of freshwater withdrawals as a proportion of available freshwater resources.



SDG target 6.4 aims to “substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.” The second of two indicator reports highlighting progress under this target, the publication describes the methodological approach used to test indicator 6.4.2 (water stress) in the five pilot countries of Jordan, the Netherlands, Peru, Senegal and Uganda, and presents the global baseline data for the indicator for the 2015-2018 period.

Noting that water stress affects every continent, the report finds that more than 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, with Western and Central Asia, and Northern Africa being the most affected regions. A high level of water stress is linked to negative effects of social and economic development, increasing competition and potential conflict among users. Based on an analysis of the period between 1996 and 2016, the report concludes that water stress has increased for most countries in the world and has more than doubled in 26 countries, 15 of which are in Africa. Among likely reasons for these trends, the report highlights increased economic activities, growing populations and improved ways to measure water usage, along with effects of climatic changes.

Even minimal savings could significantly alleviate water stress in arid countries where agriculture accounts for 90% of freshwater withdrawals.

While the majority of countries scored “well below the 25% threshold of initial water stress,” around 23 countries are reported as experiencing water stress above 70%, and 15 countries “withdraw more than 100% of their renewable freshwater resources.” These results are contrasted against declining water stress in 44 countries, half of which are in Europe, due to, inter alia, improved water-use efficiency and shifting economic activities to less water intensive sectors.

The report describes agriculture as the largest water user, accounting for nearly 70% of all water withdrawals globally, but notes that its share is decreasing in the overall sectoral distribution. For developing countries, however, the report suggests that agriculture offers the greatest opportunities for reducing withdrawals and saving water, noting that “even minimal savings” could significantly alleviate water stress in other sectors, particularly in arid countries “where agriculture accounts for 90% of freshwater withdrawals.”

Specific solutions to reduce the abstraction of water recommended in the report include the increased use of non-conventional water resources, such as reuse of wastewater, desalinated water and direct use of agricultural drainage water. Safe wastewater reuse and recycling are highlighted as being “a significantly untapped resource for industry and agriculture,” although the report notes the need to first overcome “political and cultural barriers.”

Discussing how to apply the findings at the national level, the report notes that high water stress indicates substantial use of water resources, with greater impacts on resource sustainability and the potential for conflict among users. Relying on pilot results from Peru, the report concludes that interpretation of indicator 6.4.2 could be further enhanced by conducting a deeper analysis at the basin and regional level as this would provide a better picture of water stress distribution within a country, and therefore help to assess where to target more efforts.

The SDG 6.4.2 tracking report was published as part of the Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI) initiative, which falls under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6. GEMI was established in 2014 to harmonize and expand existing monitoring efforts focused on water, wastewater and ecosystem resources (SDG targets 6.3 to 6.6).

Transboundary water cooperation is critical for ensuring sustainable management of water resources and achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. Across the world, 153 countries share rivers, lakes and aquifers. Transboundary basins cover more than half of the Earth’s land surface, account for an estimated 60 per cent of global freshwater flow and are home to more than 40 per cent of the world’s population.

Transboundary water cooperation is a precondition for sustainable development, peace and stability. Transboundary waters create social, economic, environmental and political inter-dependencies. They not only sustain populations across borders but also connect economic sectors and ecosystems in the basins. Conflicting demands over shared waters can engender political conflicts and regional instability.

As the only target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development explicitly referring to transboundary cooperation, target 6.5 can play a catalytic role across multiple SDGs and targets. It can generate multiple benefits relating to the protection of human health, renewable energy provision, sustainable agriculture, climate adaptation, ecosystem protection, and peace and security.

Cooperation is shaped by the particular historical, legal and political context, and existing arrangements vary considerably in terms of scope and intensity of cooperation. They all reflect a tangible commitment by the countries involved to manage water resources at the transboundary level and are founded upon customary international law principles. Basin-specific arrangements are greatly supported by regional and global frameworks such as the Water Convention, the Watercourses Convention, the European Commission (EU) Water Framework Directive and the Revised Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Protocol.

In some regions and basins, significant progress has been made to further transboundary water cooperation through operational arrangements. Progress is particularly advanced in Europe and Northern America, and in most major river and lake basins in sub-Saharan Africa. Regional legal frameworks, such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Revised SADC Protocol, have proven to be important drivers of transboundary water cooperation.

However, results from the 6.5.2 indicator monitoring exercises show that arrangements for transboundary water cooperation are often absent. The first SDG indicator 6.5.2 monitoring exercise has demonstrated that for the 62 countries considered, only 59 per cent of their transboundary basin area is covered by operational arrangements, while only 17 countries have all their transboundary basins covered by operational arrangements. These results are consistent with those for SDG indicator 6.5.1.

Cooperation on transboundary aquifers represents a particular challenge and is lagging further behind. Despite the numerous services that groundwater provides for both humans and ecosystems, operational arrangements for transboundary aquifers are still rare around the world. Transboundary aquifers entered late on the scientific and political agendas, probably to a large extent on account of the hidden nature and the political unattractiveness of groundwater. Delineating transboundary aquifers and realizing commitments to coordinated or joint management of this invisible resource therefore pose particular challenges.

If target 6.5 is to be achieved by 2030, progress must be accelerated and all transboundary basins must be covered by an operational arrangement. At the current rate of progress, with on average three agreements entered into per year, we are not on track to achieve target 6.5.

To this end, we need to capitalize on the experience and outputs of the first SDG indicator 6.5.2 reporting exercise. For the first time, a country-based process provides a robust methodology for monitoring cooperation on the world’s transboundary basins. This can play an important role in advancing transboundary cooperation. It is important that countries and regions where reporting levels are currently low also engage in reporting exercises, and that synergies between reporting on 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 are exploited. Moreover, SDG indicator 6.5.2 reports should be used to set national and basin-specific targets related to transboundary water cooperation.

Cooperation can be strengthened by capitalizing on the momentum in support of the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (Watercourses Convention), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) and the Draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers, sharing knowledge and experience of the benefits of transboundary water cooperation, improving financing for transboundary water cooperation and increasing capacity-building initiatives.","Key MessagesTransboundary water cooperation is critical for ensuring sustainable management of water resources and achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.

Started in 2015, the SDGs are a set of 17 goals which aim to address social and economic development issues around the world by 2030. With only twelve years remaining before full implementation of the SDGs, speculations are on the rise regarding the ability to fully realize all the aspired aims of the SDGs. Many argue that while the SDGs are much improved as compared to the World Health Organization’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), they are still not good enough. Special focus has been directed toward SDG 16, looking into how governments will be able to realize “peace, justice and strong institutions” and fulfill their commitments to building effective, accountable and inclusive organizations. SDG 16 was described as being the most ambitious and yet the most challenging goal of the 17 total SDGs.

The United Nations’ organizations are working hard to incentivize countries around the globe to keep the SDGs in mind and work toward their implementation. Within that context, the United Nations Public Service Forum and Awards Ceremony was held in Marrakech, Morocco from June 21 to June 23, 2018. The Forum was titled: “Transforming Governance for Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals” and was organized jointly by the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the Kingdom of Morocco. Over the duration of the conference, more than 750 international participants discussed good practices, strategies and challenges to achieve the SDGs.

What inspired me the most was that on the June 23, in celebration of the UN Public Service Day, awards were given out to eight programs and initiatives from eight different countries in recognition of their excellence and innovation in realizing the SDGs and fulfilling the principle of leaving no one behind. These awards are basically one significant way of highlighting successful initiatives and pilot projects that lead the way toward the partial realization of SDG 16. I thought it is useful here to share a glimpse of what those winning initiatives are and to try to figure out lessons Egypt can learn from the awardees. The awards were divided into three main categories.

Category One focused on “reaching the poorest and most vulnerable through inclusive services and partnerships” and in that category the two winners were from Indonesia and Austria. In Indonesia, the award was given to the “Initiative for Reducing Malaria” whereby—through collaboration between local government, nonprofits and the private sector—a program was implemented to raise awareness about malaria, educate villagers, and repack malaria medicine in a more-friendly format and thus significantly reduce malaria morbidity rates in twelve piloted villages.

In Austria, the award was bestowed on the “Initiative for Talents Development Among Migrants.” In this program, the city of Trofaicach, together with a private company, established a boarding school for under-age migrants to provide them with skills training, in addition to regular schooling and orientation about Austrian culture, so as to be able to find jobs easily upon graduation and fill a real need in the Austrian market for skilled labor.

Category Two called for “making institutions inclusive and ensuring participation in decision making” and in this category there were three winners from South Korea, Colombia and Spain. In South Korea, the award was given to the “Initiative for Transparent Tax Administration,” where in one South Korean province an online fiscal information system was established that disclosed all budgetary revenues and expenditures to the public in real time. This enabled citizens to check government-based financial operations via the website, resulting in improved efficiency and was the reason the Finance law was changed to require all local governments do the same and disclose their expenditures and revenues on a daily basis.

Meanwhile in Colombia, the award was given to the “Initiative for Building Peace Among Rivals” where, in the city of Manizales, a number of public and private entities cooperated and managed to improve the city’s security situation through implementing an initiative targeting youth in conflict prone districts. Once the youth had been targeted, the project worked to engaging them in dialogue with members of rival gangs and helped them with education and job opportunities.

Finally, in Spain, the award was given to the “Initiative for Citizen Participation” where in Madrid, an online platform was established to receive citizens’ views, proposals and suggestions for the improvement of public services. The aim has reportedly succeeded in making the city more transparent and inclusive for its citizenry.

Category Three of the awards recognized the promotion of, “gender responsive public services to achieve the SDGs” and in that category the winners came from Kenya, Thailand, and Switzerland. In Kenya, the “Initiative for Promoting Gender Responsive Public Service” was awarded because of the country’s success in integrating women and youth issues in the agricultural value chain of 47 counties across Kenya.

In Thailand, the winning initiative was for low cost “Visual Inspection and treatment of Cancer Patients in Remote Areas.” Through collaboration between the Thai Health Ministry and technical experts, a pilot project was implemented that succeeded in controlling and treating cervical cancer at low cost in rural and remote areas where originally services were lacking.

Finally, in Switzerland, there was recognition for the “Initiative for Advancing Gender Equal Pay (SAGE).” This is a nationwide initiative by the Swiss public sector to ensure conformance with gender equal pay that has changed public discourse nationwide about the issue. Despite the high level of development in Switzerland, there has continued to be cases of inequitable pay to women across sectors.

Learnables for Egypt

Rewarding excellence and innovation in public service is in itself an important message. The practice was implemented several years ago in Egypt by Former Minister of Administrative Reform Ahmed Darwish, following the Emirati model of having secret assessors visit public organizations and rate the public organizations’ services. The best organizations studied by Darwish’s assessors used to be feted at the Cairo Opera House in a jovial ceremony. Just this week, it was announced that the excellence awards in public service will be resumed, and a conference was jointly organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform and the Emirati government. Hopefully, we are witnessing a celebration of excellence in public service once more.

Using the term ‘public service’ is also an important message and reminder to all employees that they are there to serve the public and not to control the populace or antagonize them.

Employing innovative methods to solve problems and provide improved service to citizens were key features in all the winning initiatives at the 2018 United Nations Public Service Awards. Information technology was vital in Madrid and in South Korea through the online platforms used, whether to receive citizens’ feedback in the former or to relay information about expenditures and revenues in the latter. Both initiatives led to reduced corruption and enhanced efficiency. However, innovation is not limited to using new technology. In the case of Colombia, the innovative solution focused on engaging rivals in a dialogue through providing jobs and education as incentives, and thus managed to solve deeply entrenched problems.

Cooperation between government, civil society and the private sector was also a repeated feature in most of the initiatives. The private sector sometimes is more adept in using updated technology—or has different technical solutions—such as in Austria or in Indonesia. Meanwhile, nonprofits and civil society organizations have greater outreach powers and more enhanced communication skills with citizens especially in marginalized communities, such as was the case in the cancer treatment program in Thailand.

Coming up with win-win solutions was also a key feature at the 2018 United Nations Public Service Awards. In Austria, both migrants and the Austrian nation benefited from the initiative, whereby trained migrants managed to find decent jobs and at the same time filled a vacancy in the Austrian job market.

Adopting a true willingness to improve on the quality of life of citizens means to engage them in the decision-making process, provide them with better services, and ensure that equity, transparency and inclusiveness are what matters. These are the attributes which distinguish these eight success stories and provide us with multiple lessons for the Egyptian experience.

These include engaging businesses to align their operations and investments with the SDGs as well as using tools to ensure good governance and policy coherence, both in-country and through development cooperation.

A high-level meeting on the theme, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ is scheduled for 24 September 2018, where UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to unveil a new private investment strategy. As outlined by Global Policy Watch, the meeting format will include three “Davos-style” panels with CEOs from the private sector, heads of state and technological innovators. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted, during a 27 July briefing on the meeting, that the world is seeing a “waning commitment” to international trade, climate, economic and financial cooperation, and that we need to not only step up engagement with the private sector, but also take advantage of financial and technological innovations to bridge gaps.

On private sector action, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN Global Compact (UNGC) have released a publication titled, ‘A Practical Guide,’ which addresses integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting. The publication follows two previous guidance documents for enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs, and outlines a three-step process to define priority SDG targets, measure and analyze objectives, and “report, integrate and implement change,” while also considering data users’ needs. The publication, developed in collaboration with Shift and PwC, warns against selecting SDGs that are easiest to report on, and instead encourages companies to focus on what is most important—or material—to their business. A more detailed write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub is forthcoming.

Also on business-SDG engagement, an edie article summarizes a webinar featuring experts from BT, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and DNV GL. Held 26 July 2018, the discussion builds on recent reports that find that, although many businesses have made pledges on SDG uptake and implementation, few feature measurable targets related to—or that measure progress against—the Goals. Panelists recognized the need for transparency on businesses’ negative impacts and the importance of identifying them in order to tackle them first. They further noted that the SDGs present an opportunity to move beyond reactive or isolated sustainability actions, and that engaging external actors that are likely to apply pressure has become “business as usual” for them.

A blog on the UN Development Programme (UNDP) website describes how companies are beginning to move beyond a business-as-usual approach. The post describes a “fourth sector” of for-profit entities “whose main purpose is to solve social and environmental problems, but generate their income mainly through commercial activities.” The author, Heerad Sabeti, is CEO of the Fourth Sector Group, which was launched in collaboration with the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress and UNDP, among other partners. Sabeti also highlights progress in South America, offering Natura as an example of a business that is contributing to “virtually every SDG in Brazil.”

On governance, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released a report titled, ‘Governance for Integrated Solutions to Sustainable Development and Climate Change: From linking issues to aligning interests.’ The report’s chapters focus primarily on the Asia-Pacific region, looking at the co-benefits of an integrated approach derived from the alignment of disparate agencies and other stakeholders. The study develops a conceptual model to illustrate which actors should be involved, and looks at horizontal, vertical and multi-stakeholder coordination in the transportation and solid waste management sectors, as well as across the water-energy-food nexus. The authors conclude that in some cases, more engagement is not needed, as the necessary relationships may already exist. However, they note the increasingly important trend of “governance beyond governments,” signaling a need for flexibility in engagement strategies. IGES also recently launched a web tool that enables users to visualize SDG targets’ interactions with others, to help assess synergies and trade-offs and inform decision-making in both the public and private sectors.

Patrick Curran, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, underscores the importance of policy coherence, called for in SDG target 17.14. Curran notes that countries’ development pathways—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa—are highly dependent on the water-energy-food nexus, noting that policies in these sectors are not currently “joined-up.” He emphasizes that reliance on donor support can sometimes undermine coherent policy, as aid has the potential to look at sectors or issues in isolation. To mitigate a siloed approach, Curran calls for the review and update of national development plans, conducted with the support of inter-ministerial and multi-stakeholder committees.

Breaking out of a siloed approach means building multi-actor partnerships (MAPs), as outlined in a German Development Institute (DIE) discussion paper titled, ‘Incentivizing and Regulating Multi-actor Partnerships and Private Sector Engagement in Development Cooperation.’ Authored by Dorothea Wehrmann, the paper describes challenges to engaging private sector actors in development cooperation towards long-term agendas such as the SDGs. Wehrmann looks at the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) to examine how such networks and partnerships can enhance MAPs’ engagement and effectiveness. She finds that these arrangements must: 1) strengthen institutional oversight; 2) support case-specific incentivizing and regulating strategies; and 3) lend further credence to context-specificity, for example, in South-South cooperation. All types of engagement will be critical in the context of reduced UN funding, as highlighted by Devex.

A Brookings report on options for filling the financing void for the SDGs focuses on increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries by increasing engagement with development finance institutions and MDBs.

On development finance more broadly, the Brookings Institution’s George Ingram and Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr. examine ways to raise the US$2.4 trillion needed annually in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030. They outline four options for filling the void, focusing primarily on the fourth: 1) eliminating trade barriers; 2) increasing official development assistance (ODA); 3) mobilizing domestic resources by creating an enabling environment for private investment; and 4) increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by increasing engagement with development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). They compare DFIs in the US, Europe and Asia to offer recommendations that can mobilize additional private capital.

A significant portion of the finance needed is for infrastructure, as discussed in a DIE paper looking primarily at the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS Bank. The paper titled, ‘Mobilizing Capital for Sustainable Infrastructure: The cases of AIIB and NDB,’ reviews instruments to mobilize private capital, building in experiences of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and others to identify lessons for “low-cost” finance providers. Given the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure, the authors note the importance of these DFIs in the sector, especially in the context of long-term sustainable development, as the social and environmental impacts of infrastructure investments are “locked in” for the duration of the projects’ lifetimes. The paper notes a need to increase the attractiveness of more sustainable projects, including by boosting returns through blended finance, de-risking through co-finance or other guarantees, and through specialized instruments used by the EIB and International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Regardless of whether they focus on public or private sectors, the above papers cut across the 5 P’s of sustainable development: people, planet, prosperity, partnerships and peace. A blog post by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that, by articulating objectives in this manner, the SDGs “represent the basic requirements of human decency.” Recognizing the linkages between these principles and their work, the IMF piece identifies how their projects and initiatives map to each pillar.

The paper describes a process through which companies can prioritize SDG actions and impacts without “cherry-picking” Goals that they already positively contribute to, and highlights principles for effective, comprehensive reporting.

Titled, ‘Integrating the SDGs into Corporate Reporting: A Practical Guide,’ the document follows two papers launched in the past year by GRI and UN Global Compact, completing a three-part toolkit on enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs. The guide aims to help companies prioritize SDG targets for action and reporting, regardless of their size or scope, as well as assist businesses with measurement of progress. In doing so, the paper helps businesses move beyond “simply” mapping their activities to the SDGs.

Reporting is a strategic tool to engage stakeholders, support decision making, shape business strategy and attract investments.

The publication outlines a three-step process to: define priority SDG targets and impacts; set and measure objectives, and analyze performance; and “report, integrate and implement change.” Each step features three sub-components, each of which are supported by SDG examples and other entry points for action. The process explicitly avoids creating a new reporting framework. Instead, it builds on existing principles and guidelines, including GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Standards, UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as outputs from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Following these guidelines, the publication sets out a process of “principled prioritization” for the SDGs. The approach, the paper notes, includes consideration of two entry points: 1) risks to people and the environment; and 2) beneficial SDG-related products, services and investments. These entry points allow companies to address negative impacts from their operations or value chains and apply their knowledge, skills and capabilities in contribution to the SDGs. The guide highlights that the process further enables companies to align their strategies and resource allocations with their impacts and disclosures, as well as identify whether new actions or strategy alterations are needed.

The publication underscores that reporting is a strategic tool to engage stakeholders, support decision making, shape business strategy and attract investments, noting that it is “neither the start nor the end of a company’s sustainability strategy.” With the SDGs also catching the attention of investors, the paper emphasizes the strong business case for investing in opportunities that are aligned with the Goals. However, it warns that companies must avoid “SDG-washing” which the authors define as reporting positive contributions to the SDGs while ignoring important negative impacts. They highlight that a principled prioritization process is designed to help companies avoid “cherry-picking” Goals or targets and therefore avoid SDG-washing.

The paper was developed with expert input from Shift, technical support from PwC and financial support from the Government of Sweden, as part of a broader Action Platform on Reporting on the SDGs. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the other knowledge products available through the platform and its partners, and maps which tools can support each of the five steps of SDG engagement defined by the SDG Compass.

The report is based on data from 79 countries, and finds that only 59% of domestic wastewater flow is collected and safely treated, and insufficient information is available for estimates of industrial wastewater treatment.



SDG target 6.3 sets out several objectives for improving water quality, including halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. An indicator for this target (6.3.1) measures “Proportion of wastewater safely treated,” through two sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater (SDG indicators 6.3.1a and 6.3.1b, respectively).

The report explains the methodology used to develop the global baseline on wastewater, and provides definitions of the terms used in the sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater. The authors caution that their findings probably represent the “upper limit” of current achievements, as the data come mostly from high-income and middle-income countries, and likely do not reflect the situation in many Asian and African countries.

The report draws attention to the contributions of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda.

The agencies highlight that many millions of people are at risk from contaminated water, and urge policy makers to regulate and enforce pollution control measures. They emphasize the need to better harmonize reporting on this issue through the application of common metrics.

The report also draws attention to the contribution of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, for example, in relation to drinking water, sanitation, and water-use efficiency (SDG targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, respectively), reduction of waterborne diseases (SDG target 3.3), water availability to boost food production (SDG target 2.4), nutrition (SDG target 2.2), and sustainable urbanization (SDG target 11.2).

The report recommends using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) codes to identify heavy polluters, pollution sources, and types of pollution as a basis for applying the “polluter pays” principle, especially with regard to industrial pollution. It also proposes an additional SDG indicator to capture the extent of wastewater reuse.

The wastewater baseline report was one of seven such studies launched by UN-Water at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

194,https://www.devex.com/news/challenges-facing-sdg-2030-deadline-for-safe-water-and-sanitation-93249,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Challenges facing SDG 2030 deadline for safe water and sanitation,"CANBERRA — Under goal six of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments are committed to targets for clean water and sanitation by 2030 — including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the lead up to a High-level Political Forum held at the United Nations in July, which discussed progress and challenges on a range of SDGs, including goal six, WaterAid Australia drew attention to the challenges of achieving the objective.

By analyzing the most recent data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which shows the percentage of the population in each nation with access to basic water and sanitation, WaterAid showed that the goal is unlikely to be achieved by 2030. The current rate of progress will see centuries before universal access to basic water and sanitation is achieved.

Further analysis of the source data, which shows progress achieved on a range of water and sanitation indicators between 2000 and 2015, suggests that only 21 countries are on target to achieve basic water and sanitation services for their entire population. Meanwhile, 68 countries have seen progress on targets decline since 2000.

The 'S word:' Is it time for the sanitation sector to reconsider subsidies? As donors and implementers grapple with how to deal with the world’s looming sanitation crisis, old debates over the use of subsidies are flaring up again. But experts told Devex of an emerging consensus that there is space for subsidies — if deployed in new and smarter ways.

Responding to environmental and political obstacles, as well as the challenges created in getting the last percentage of the population across the line for basic water and sanitation services, are barriers governments are being asked to urgently deal with, to ensure SDG 6 can be achieved.

Which countries are achieving targets?

Of the 21 countries that have achieved, or are on track to achieve, basic water and sanitation access for the entire population, only three countries classified as developed countries are expected to achieve both basic water and sanitation targets — Australia, Estonia, and Portugal.

There are also developing countries that have made major gains between 2000 and 2015, including Laos, Sri Lanka, Tokelau, and Vietnam. Based on the current rate of progress, these countries are expected to provide basic water and sanitation services for the entire population by 2030.

According to the data, Laos has been one of the biggest achievers. In 2000, less than half of the population had access to basic water and just over a quarter of the population had basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 80 percent of the population had access to basic water while almost three-quarters of the population had basic sanitation.

Based on its current rate of progress, Laos is projected to achieve national access to basic water and sanitation by 2024.

Vietnam is another success story according to the data. In 2000, almost a quarter of the population — most of them living in rural areas — were missing out on basic water access, with nearly half without basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 91 percent of the population had access to basic water, putting the country on track to achieve universal basic water access by 2025.

Now, just under 80 percent of the population has access to basic sanitation — with huge gains made in rural Vietnam. By 2028, the country is projected to achieve universal access based on current progress.

Which countries are in decline?

A concerning trend in the data is countries moving backward on access to basic water or sanitation for populations between 2000 and 2015. These include a wide range of nations: Bermuda, Jordan, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Slovenia, and Zimbabwe.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates.” — Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had enabled 36.7 percent of its population to access basic water and 18.7 percent basic sanitation. By 2015, this number had declined to 36.6 percent and 18.6 percent respectively — small declines by percentage but major barriers to achieving universal basic and water access by 2030.

Other countries started 2000 with a major percentage of their population having accessible water and sanitation, only to drop.

In 2000, Nieu, for example, was providing more than 99.2 percent of its population with access to basic water and 100 percent of its population with access to basic sanitation. Fifteen years later they had both declined — basic water coverage declined to 98.2 percent and basic sanitation to 97.8 percent.

In 2004, Nieu was hit by the worst cyclone on its record, Cyclone Heta, which is likely to have played a role in the decline of water and sanitation. This demonstrates the challenges of natural disasters, conflict, and more, in the ability to achieve the 2030 targets.

Where is progress slow?

For other countries, barriers come from two key challenges: Starting from a low base or slow progress in achieving the final percentage points.

Equatorial Guinea’s population coverage of basic water rose from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2015 — an average improvement of 0.05 percent each year. Based on this rate of progress, Equatorial Guinea will achieve national coverage for basic water by 3119.

The challenge for Equatorial Guinea is in rural areas. While water coverage for urban regions is dramatically improving — with total coverage expected to be reached by 2037 in urban areas — coverage is worsening in rural areas, dropping from 39.9 percent coverage in 2000 to 30.5 percent in 2015. For basic sanitation, the entire nation is moving backward.

Why you should care about 'systems' in WASH The focus in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector needs to shift from the number of pumps or latrines built to a more sustainable, systems-wide approach, according to many insiders. Enter Agenda for Change, a coalition of organizations that seek to demonstrate how this can be done through collective action.

Similarly, Eritrea has a long road ahead. Beginning in 2000, data shows just 16.8 percent of the nation had access to basic water and 7.5 percent access to basic sanitation. By 2015, these numbers had improved, increasing to 19.3 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. But this slow rate of improvement projects that basic water will be provided to the entire population by 2507 and basic sanitation by 2374.

For Vanuatu, the rate of progress on water will see the country just miss the 2030 deadline. Vanuatu is projected to achieve national coverage by 2031. Just over half the population had access to appropriate facilities for basic sanitation in 2015, but with an annual progress of 0.2 percent, the country is projected to achieve basic sanitation targets by 3468.

These three nations also face other challenges.

Equatorial Guinea faces political challenges under the dictatorship of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who seized control of the country in a 1979 military coup. Eritrea has faced conflict with neighboring countries, U.N. sanctions, and droughts. And Vanuatu faces the impact of natural disasters, with Cyclone Pam causing widespread devastation in 2015, as well as the high cost of delivering services to the Pacific region.

At the time the data was collected, Puerto Rico was struggling to provide basic services to the last 3 percent of its population, in both water and sanitation. In 2015, basic water coverage had increased from 97.1 percent to 97.1. Yet, because the annual rate of growth averaged 0.003 percent, Puerto Rico was predicted basic national water access by 2773, with basic sanitation predicted by 2443. The data does not take into account the impact of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, on basic water and sanitation availability.

Despite national basic water coverage, 1 percent of Germany’s population has no access to basic sanitation. The country’s slow rate of progress means universal coverage is projected by 3753.

Belgium too struggles with slow progress. While nearly the entire population has access to water now, national basic sanitation is projected to be achieved by 4817.

Addressing the challenges

Achieving universal basic water and sanitation services by 2030 are hampered by a range of local factors. Although projections show the challenging road ahead for water and sanitation, they do not factor in additional challenges — such as future natural disasters, conflicts, and economic crises — have in achieving universal access targets.

WASH sector NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, and private consultants are all crucial players in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6.

With data at hand showing the gravity of the challenge, it is hoped that better practices might be developed, through planning and policy, to support universal access. By breaking the data down into in rural and urban coverage, it becomes evident where they exist: Commonly in rural areas.

At the conclusion of a High-level Political Forum, former President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council Marie Chatardová spoke on the challenges of water and sanitation coverage.

“We … held extensive discussions on the SDG 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on cities, 12 on sustainable consumption and production, 15 on life on land, and 17 on partnerships,” she said.

“We came up with many recommendations … Those include establishing a ‘blue fund’ to support design and implementation of transboundary water management for SDG 6.”

She highlighted the importance of partnering with the private sector and other new partners to achieve the goals. But whether the outcomes of the High-level Political Forum, including delivery of the proposed blue fund, will achieve significant changes in the projections is yet to be seen.

“For nations to be years off track in meeting the human right to water and sanitation is shocking,” said Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia, prior to the political forum.

“The meeting of ministers at HLPF must result in more than just words of encouragement because we have only 12 years left to keep the promise made to those living without clean water or a decent toilet. Governments must prioritise water, sanitation and hygiene — the basic building blocks of any stable and prosperous community — ensuring proper financing is put in place to build a more sustainable country today and for future generations,” he said.

WaterAid is calling on governments, donors, financial institutions, and the private sector to prioritize financing for water and sanitation and to integrate the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene into strategies for education, health, and nutrition programs globally.

Experts are calling for more investment into research and programs to tackle stigma and barriers surrounding issues of sanitation.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates,” Muller said.

With one child dying every two minutes from diarrhea caused by dirty water, poor sanitation, and bad hygiene, according to WaterAid, more than a quarter of million children will die each year basic water and sanitation targets are not met — a figure unacceptable to both Muller and the objectives of the SDGs.

195,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/political-challenges-in-monitoring-sdg-6/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Political Challenges in Monitoring SDG 6,"Last month, at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, US, a central part of the discussions on achieving and monitoring SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) was the importance of looking at water quality in a broader context. One example is looking at the quality of freshwater in the context of other sectors, in relationship to food security, or the impact on other resources such as soil. This topic will once again be high on the agenda at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden, later this month.

Seeing freshwater quality in a broader context is no doubt important, but what we often forget is that implementing this broader view comes along with significant measurement challenges. At the forefront of these challenges is the difficulty of identifying relevant data and information needs in view of multiple goals, meeting these data and information needs, and interpreting data and information. These challenges involve various interests and require negotiations. In other words, addressing them is a political matter. To meet such challenges, water quality measurement must move beyond being a technical issue addressed by natural scientists alone, and become a topic for inter- and transdisciplinary research teams.

Changing the Scope Means Redefining Measurements, Process, and Use

Let us first have a look at what has to be measured. If we consider multiple goals when measuring water quality, this complicates the process of identifying data and information needs. Before measurement programmes can be set up, the management goal needs to be clear, for example using water in agriculture for energy and/or food production. This is often not the case due to a lack of regulations specifying integrated measurement goals (such as for soil and water management). Developing such regulations requires negotiation processes laden with transaction costs for all relevant actors. Further, even if the goals are clarified, it often remains unclear what types of indicators, data and standards are best suited to efficiently monitor progress in achieving a goal (for instance standards for health-related water quality or lower standards). This leads to the question of whether existing indicators can be used or combined indicators are needed.

Let us assume now we know what has to be measured. The next question would be how we can obtain the relevant data and information. We see here a couple of challenges for meeting these needs. First, one needs many different types of data and information, such as data on the quality of waters, soils, agricultural yields, and human health. Second, such data needs are particularly challenging to meet from the technical point of view, given the high complexity of the social-ecological system. Take, for instance, the impact of fertilizers on the amount of nitrogen in groundwater. This impact depends on various factors such as weather conditions, the cultivated plants or soil characteristics. Such complexity can lead to unforeseen or delayed effects, which complicate measurement programmes even further. Third, even if data are available, information transfer has particularly high requirements, since data are typically dispersed across research groups (e.g. soil and water scientists) and public authorities (e.g. water and agricultural authorities). Sharing data between these entities can be challenging as there is often a lack of communication or trust, or asymmetric power and interests are involved. All this ultimately hinders the establishment of sufficient and inclusive databases.

Let us assume for a moment we can overcome these challenges and have our data at hand. A third challenge then regards their use for a truly integrated assessment of solutions. We assume here that it will be particularly challenging to interpret data and information given multiple baselines of partly conflicting goals. Take, for instance, measuring the amount of nitrogen in soils and water. High amounts of nitrogen can be interpreted in various ways. From a water quality perspective, high amounts are problematic since they lead to the eutrophication of waters; from an agricultural perspective, however, it may also indicate a high production level, leading to economic growth and food security. Understanding such relations requires thinking in new, broader systems that may go beyond traditional check lists of good practices.

Addressing New Challenges in Measurement

While seeing freshwater quality in a broader context seems to be good idea for achieving truly sustainable development, we have to be prepared for increased challenges in the measurement process. These challenges are not only technical, but also political, meaning that they involve political discourses among various stakeholders, reflecting various interests and power asymmetries. New tools based on rigorous research need to be developed to help practitioners overcome such political challenges.

At the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we believe that measurement-related activities should be conducted in a participatory manner from the very start. First, an interdisciplinary research agenda on water quality measurement is the way forward. Measuring water quality has mainly been understood as a natural science endeavor. However, addressing the politics in defining targets, gathering data, and interpreting data calls for the involvement of social scientists. Take, for instance, the question of data sharing. Extensive and successful research conducted by political scientists on the conditions of information sharing in conflict-laden environments can help design water measurement programmes in the face of complex societal goals.

The second step is to deepen existing stakeholder engagement by opening the natural science-dominated field of measurement to the broad range of stakeholders in resource management. Practitioners can be involved here in setting the frame for measurement. (Natural) scientists have to refer to these societal needs when setting up measurement programmes within their research programmes. This can be done, for instance, by discussing measurement challenges together with stakeholders of different ministries in joint workshops.

Since 2015, BIP, supported by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), the European Commission, and Switzerland’s Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), has been working to fill gaps in the available indicators for both the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity targets. Since the debut of the project, 30 more indicators have been added. Thirteen of these are official SDG indicators, including the Red List Index of trends in the conservation status of species, protected area coverage of important areas for biodiversity, and the Wetland Extent Trends Index. Many of the other indicators are also relevant to one or more of the SDGs and associated targets, including SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 10 (reduced inequalities), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The BIP website has a dedicated web page for each indicator.

BIP has also created a mapping table that helps users identify synergies between indicators for the SDGs and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The table aims to support users in identifying indicators that are suitable for national use, which can also help countries in reporting processes such as their sixth national reports under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Additionally, the BIP website has a dedicated web page for each indicator.

199,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-the-belt-and-road-initiative-and-chinas-investment-in-africa/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: The Belt and Road Initiative and China’s Investment in Africa,"With tensions high in the global community around trade policies and international relations, this week’s brief reviews some of the differences in countries’ approaches to investment abroad. Following recent headlines, it examines China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in tandem with cooperation in Africa, highlighting the implications for sustainable development on the continent.

Announced in 2013 with the promise of providing a “silk road for the 21st century,” the BRI consists primarily of state- and privately-financed infrastructure projects in developing countries. The Initiative has been met with both praise and skepticism.

In the Financial Times, Beijing Foreign Studies University’s Gu Bin says, the “spirit of the BRI reinforces the value of building a shared future,” highlighting key differences that distinguish it from the post-World War II Marshall Plan led by the US. However, Sean Kenji Starrs, City University of Hong Kong, responds by noting the BRI is “no selfless venture.” He cites debt, other aspects of neocolonialism and increasing homogeneity of Chinese academia as causes for concern (though these points are also contested).

The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development’s (ICTSD) July publication of Bridges Africa zooms in on China-Africa economic relations. The introductory article flags that some have questioned the “balance and quality” of the relationship from an African perspective, given China’s high and immediate demand for natural resources. It also notes recent data that show decreases since 2013-2014 in Chinese investment in Africa, China-Africa trade, and Chinese loans to Africa. However, Yunnan Chen identifies opportunities for promoting sustainable development, emphasizing not only renewable energy and transportation projects, but also the scope for technology transfer and diversification of sourcing.

The International Institute for Environment and Development’s (IIED) James Mayers examines the complex impact of Chinese investment in Africa, linking particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), in a “long read” titled, ‘Finding a Green Path for China and Africa?’. Some investments, Mayers says, “gobble up forest and woodland. Some bring huge benefits to African economies. Some do both.” The article offers an overview of the BRI and provides insight to a topic that often features perceptions that have been “assumed rather than really known.” Mayers identifies context-specific constraints to more sustainable timber production and processing, particularly in small-scale operations that “have traditionally worked under the radar of policy and legality.” A key gap, he notes, is connecting businesses to the remote areas and people where their investments often materialize, and breaking down stereotypes or prejudices across stakeholder groups.

IIED also produced a short film on the linkages between Chinese investment in Africa and the continent’s forests, which it emphasizes are increasingly being converted to agriculture or sent to China – the world’s “only reliable market” in the eyes of one interviewee. Darlindo Pechisso, National Directorate of Forests, Mozambique, notes that 90% of the country’s timber is exported to China. The article and film are part of a wider project supported by the UK on China-Africa Forest Governance.

Looking at trade more broadly through an agricultural lens, the fourth in a series of articles on Impakter asks whether achieving the SDGs is a “grassroots-up” or “global trade-down” endeavor. The article notes that at the local level, 45 million small farms in Africa produce the bulk of countries’ agricultural exports, and that trade links these smallholders to global food value chains. The authors, from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAO), also highlight large agribusinesses and multinationals, which they indicate as having a leading role, but will have to “substantially change” their business to contribute to the SDGs and minimize the negative impacts of their operations. A Devex Q&A on support to African entrepreneurs also notes the potential for agriculture and trade in Africa.

Following the recent BRICS Summit in South Africa, China’s President Xi Jinping signed a number of cooperation documents on the continent. An opinion piece on China Global Television Network (CGTN) by China’s ambassador to Somalia, Qin Jian, calls the BRI “win-win cooperation,” noting that the BRI “reaffirms China’s commitment to building an open economy, ensures free and inclusive trade, opposes all forms of protectionism.” Qin also says the BRI stands for enhancing international cooperation through strategies that feature the SDGs and African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The Brookings Institution’s Yun Sun compares China’s state-led approach in Africa to that of the US, which is “more willing to let companies and the market” lead commercial development. She notes that while US-China cooperation around Africa’s development has been “scarce,” there is increasing collaboration between Chinese and American companies, the latter of which appear to be beneficiaries of the BRI. General Electric (GE), she highlights, has worked in partnership with the state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) on an expanded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project model. Under such a model, partners work together on joint market development, fundraising and operation. However, the article closes by cautioning that BRI projects are “designed to absorb Chinese overcapacity,” noting that most foreign firms remain at a disadvantage in competing for them. Whether these projects are aligned with the ambitions of the SDGs is yet to be seen.

Implementing the SDGs requires financial flows to, at a minimum, remain consistent. The BRI represents a significant source of funding that can begin to bridge the well-documented finance gap. However, in the broader context of a trade war and retaliatory measures or increasing national self-interest, reductions in investment or the continuation of a business-as-usual approach risks leaving the environmental and social pillars of international development unaccounted for.

In doing so, Switzerland created MONET 2030, an indicator system designed to statistically monitor implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a Swiss context. The expanded portal tracks 85 indicators across all 17 SDGs.



Of the 85 indicators monitored, MONET 2030 finds that 39 show a positive trend, 12 show no significant evolution, and 14 identify a reverse trend. These results were highlighted in Switzerland’s Voluntary National Review, which was presented to the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLFP).

MONET 2030 measures progress towards the 85 indicators by comparing observed trends to targeted trends. Targeted trends represent the desired direction of change, while observed trends reflect actual experience. Progress is assessed as positive if observed and targeted trends correspond, as negative if the observed and target trend differ, or as unchanged if the difference is greater than or less than 3%. The MONET 2030 system denotes these trends for each indicator on the front page of the site with symbolic arrows.

Users can explore each indicator in English, French or German by viewing descriptions, methodologies, reports, and graphs, which provide recent and historic data in downloadable formats. Each indicator also compares the Switzerland-defined target to its related international target, highlighting the fact that to achieve the 2030 Agenda, global goals must be assessed within a local context and addressed at the local level.

MONET 2030 is unique among countries’ online SDG portals in that it adapts an existing platform to the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to the Federal Statistical Office.

In a prior effort in SDG tracking, following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, Switzerland’s Federal Council established a commission to conduct a baseline assessment and gap analysis for the implementation of all 169 global SDG targets.

It is a leading example of how local governance structures are helping to meet national and international development frameworks and priorities.

With the mission to revitalize, strengthen and position Navakavu to engage in opportunities for growth and prosperity for a transformed Fiji, the NRS is linked to the Fiji National Development Plan 2017-2021 (NDP) and the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 (SDGs). The NRS was officially launched by the Prime Minister of Fiji and President of UNFCCC COP 23 Honourable Josaia V Bainimarama on 6 June 2018, at the Novotel Conference Centre. In a statement supporting the NRS mission, he said:

“… [W]e recognize that there is immense opportunity in a growing Fijian economy, and we want to put the Yavusa o Navakavu in the best possible position to realize those opportunities… Today marks the beginning of your conference to launch the Navakavu Revitalization Plan from 2018-2022, a plan that builds upon the strategic blueprint laid out in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan….I applaud your community for coming together to determine how you can capitalize on all the great progress and all the new opportunity that has come to Fiji. Because a government alone can only do so much. It can create a favorable environment, but it is up to individuals to take advantage…]”

The five NRS Strategic Goals that link to the Fiji NDP and SDGs address, inter alia, employment, housing, education, health, land, and infrastructure. The NRS strategic goals show how national development plans (the NDP) as well as international development roadmaps (the SDGs) can be implemented at the local level in a way that reflects local needs and priorities.

The five NRS Strategic Goals address employment, housing, education, health, land and infrastructure.

The NRS launch coincided with the 21st Anniversary of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA), which is helping to meet the targets of the SDG on life below water (SDG 14), among others. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua o Navakavu with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In Navakavu, there is a local Committee comprised of family unit heads that has worked to increase awareness of the need for, and the implementation of, strategies for fisheries conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources in the area.

The paramount chief of Navakavu, the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni, and His Council have approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protection Area to platform its long-term plan of a Live Marine/Science Laboratory, which would serve as an initiative integrating conservation, education and tourism objectives. Community discussions are underway on this “Navakavu Reef to Ridge Initiative.” It covers an area of some 3.3 square km, which is equivalent to approximately 18% of the community fishing ground area of 18.5 square km.

Local efforts are also targeting youth to ensure longevity and the intergenerational reach of projects. On 29 June 2018, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the Chief Guest with the Navakavu Youth in commemorating the World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his Council joined the youth together with officials from the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry, FLMMA network and Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation (PIANGO).

The commemoration of the Navakavu Youth World Oceans Day is in line with the Goals under the Sustainable Development Goals, the Fiji National Development Plan, the Plan for the Yasana o Rewa, the Tikina o Suva and Goal 4 of the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022.

The children and youth replanted mangroves and native trees to celebrate the day and plans are in place to clean up rubbish from our land and our beaches and our ocean. The youth and children have taken leadership as custodians of our Ocean. They too feel this moral obligation, as we are all committed to this sacred responsibility.

The ABS Clearing-House is a global repository of information that helps provide legal certainty and transparency in the context of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The ABS Clearing-House, inter alia, enables countries to monitor how genetic resources are used along the value chain for commercial or non-commercial research, which is valuable especially when genetic resources have left the country.

The Nagoya Protocol monitoring system provides “an important tool for connecting users and providers of genetic resources.”

The checkpoint communiqués from Germany and Malta mark the first time the ABS interoperability functions were used to automatically publish information on the ABS Clearing-House: information published on EU’s DECLARE tool – an EU-wide tool that enables users of genetic resources to submit the required due diligence declarations – was automatically transferred and published on the ABS Clearing-House.

Using interoperability mechanisms like the application programming interface of the ABS Clearing-House supports Parties to the Nagoya Protocol in automating the publication of information on the Clearing-House.

Launched at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden, the report finds that IWRM provides a critical framework for achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), as well as all other SDGs.

The report, serving as a “global baseline” for the indicator, presents a snapshot of the current state of affairs on water management, and emphasizes the need to accelerate progress. The report is the result of a participatory approach in which representatives from different sectors and regions responded to a questionnaire. It describes the efforts of 172 countries to implement IWRM, including successes and challenges, as well as coordination and collaboration beyond monitoring. According to the report, IWRM provides multiple benefits, including sustainable and efficient agriculture, economic stability, ecosystem protection, and peace and security. However, the publication concludes, without accelerating progress, 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve SDG target 6.5 on implementing IWRM at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation, by 2030.

As 80% of countries have already laid the foundations for IWRM, the report calls for focusing on implementation, accelerating its implementation, and taking collective action that builds on multi-stakeholder monitoring and reporting processes to accelerate implementation.

The report cites the challenges of developing a network of policies and laws that create an enabling environment, coordinating diverse players with different and often competing interests, generating data to make effective decisions, and securing the financing to implement plans. It highlights that while subnational, basin, aquifer and local levels tend to lag behind national-level implementation, multi-level coordination is critical, and many countries have arrangements and organizational frameworks for cooperation in most of their transboundary basins and aquifers.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress and achieve SDG 6.

Regarding wider implementation across sectors, the report calls for: adopting integrated approaches to water supply and wastewater treatment measures; identifying opportunities to integrate water into sectoral programmes and planning processes; and finding and adopting innovative, blended and multi-sector financing approaches to achieve sustainable water resources management under the 2030 Agenda. The report underscores that IWRM is an ongoing process with incremental impacts, and each country can identify pathways to make progress, as no “one-size-fits-all” approach exists for IWRM implementation.

The publication provides an overview of areas requiring action to advance sustainable management of water resources as identified by countries, including improving basin and aquifer management, financial arrangements and capacity development. The report also mentions specific actions highlighted by countries, including increasing monitoring stations, improving enforcement mechanisms and increasing cost recovery for water-related services.

Reporting from countries on SDG 6 core indicators provides a platform for dialogue on strengthening water resources management across sectors and stakeholders, and on identifying specific needs for capacity development, technology transfer and investments.

The report is one in a seven-report series launched by UN-Water that tracks progress towards SDG 6 targets using the SDG global indicators under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together the: World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP); Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI); and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS). The collaboration supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. [Publication: Progress on Integrated Water Resources Management: Global Baseline for SDG 6 Indicator 6.5.1] [Report Landing Page] [SDG 6 Indicator Reports Webpage] [SDG 6 Monitoring Website] [All coverage of World Water Week 2018, including series of monitoring reports]","26 August 2018: UN-Water and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) have published a report detailing progress made on implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM), as measured by SDG indicator 6.5.1 (degree of IWRM implementation).
The report, serving as a “global baseline” for the indicator, presents a snapshot of the current state of affairs on water management, and emphasizes the need to accelerate progress.

206,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-christopher-robin,"Fri, 03 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Christopher Robin’,"“It must be hard to imagine your father as a child,” Christopher’s wife, Evelyn (Hayley Atwell), says to their daughter, Madeline (Bronte Carmichael), in the most self-aware, ironic line of Marc Forster’s Christopher Robin.

For a Hollywood family film, something that seems even harder is imagining a father as an actual adult.

As played by Ewan McGregor in the latest exercise in Disney brand management, Christopher Robin is all grown up, but he’s not really an adult. (The name “Milne” isn’t mentioned; in this universe, “Robin” is his surname, not his middle name.)

I want to say Christopher is a family-film stereotype of a man who has grown up the wrong way, having lost all touch with what’s important in life, except he isn’t thought out clearly enough to be much of a character at all.

You know the type I mean: the man caught up in work and grown-up things who has no clue how to be there for his loved ones, until at last he learns a valuable lesson about play, imagination and/or family time.

In honor of the dad in Mary Poppins, we could call stories like this “Let’s Go Fly a Kite” movies, though Pooh fans will not be surprised that, instead of a kite, Christopher Robin has a balloon. (I thought about calling them “Cat’s in the Cradle” movies, but on a hunch, I Googled it. Sure enough, TV Tropes already thought of that, though the site’s preferred label is “When You Coming Home, Dad?”)

When such movies are done well, you get, say, The Incredibles or John Favreau’s Chef. When they aren’t, you get Jim Carrey in Mr. Popper’s Penguins or Steven Spielberg’s Hook — possibly the closest analogy for Christopher Robin, though Hook, for all its flaws, was clearly a personal film for Spielberg, whereas Christopher Robin feels cobbled together from bits and pieces of other movies without a cogent vision of its own.

At any rate, until Winnie the Pooh and the rest of Christopher Robin’s childhood friends show up to help him recover his childlike spirit, we’re stuck with a story in which, when Madeline asks for a bedtime story, Christopher Robin idiotically begins reading a dry British history text instead of something like Treasure Island, which is what Madeline really wants to hear.

Christopher also wants to send Madeline to the very best boarding school, which is not what Evelyn and Madeline want.

All the same, Madeline has absorbed some of her father’s work ethic; when Evelyn suggests that Madeline go out and play, Madeline embraces it as an assignment, and an opportunity to achieve, and is nonplused by her mother’s suggestion that she instead simply have fun. (She winds up pretending to play tennis with the balloon — and imagining herself winning Wimbledon.)

Most centrally, to Evelyn and Madeline’s crushing disappointment, Christopher has bailed on a promised family outing to his old countryside cottage in Sussex in order to work over the weekend on a big presentation for his London office on Monday. Notably, Christopher works at Winslow Luggage as an efficiency expert, an occupation that can function as Hollywood shorthand for a soulless corporate cog.

“If I work really hard now,” Christopher tries to explain, “in the future our lives will be ...”

“Impressive? Worse?” Evelyn interrupts. “We don’t care. We want you.”

In the midst of this too-familiar exchange, Christopher seems so caught up in the presumed plot tropes that he’s forgotten to mention a crucial fact: The callous boss (Mark Gatiss) who dropped this assignment on him earlier that day plans to fire a bunch of good people unless Christopher can figure out how to save their jobs by Monday.

“Your father promised these people good jobs after the war!” Christopher pleads, sounding not at all like a corporate cog without a soul. “They’d do anything for this company! I’d do anything for this company.”

So on the one hand Christopher Robin wants to be a movie about a London executive caught up in his work when he should be playing with his daughter in the country, reliving the magic of his childhood days; but on the other hand, it’s saddled him with a genuinely noble mission.

I’m reminded of a thoughtful line in P.J. Hogan’s flawed but interesting 2003 take on Peter Pan, in which the much ridiculed figure of Mr. Darling gets a remarkably sympathetic tribute from his wife.

Mary Darling tells her daughter Wendy that her father is a brave man. Since this version of George Darling is a rather milquetoast figure much put upon by his co-workers, this requires some explanation, so Mary continues:

“There are many different kinds of bravery. There’s the bravery of thinking of others before oneself. Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens. But he’s made many sacrifices for his family and put away many dreams.”

Continuing in a poignant, poetic mode that almost sounds like A.A. Milne, but much more like J.M. Barrie, Mrs. Darling adds that he put his dreams away “in a drawer. And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them. But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer. He does. And that is why he is brave.”

That is an actual idea, one with real poignancy, about adulthood and fatherhood and loss — something lacking in Christopher Robin. Actual ideas, I mean.

Like Forster’s own Peter Pan-themed movie, the J.M. Barrie biopic Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is handsomely appointed and mounted, with a lovely sepia-toned limited-animation prologue and flipping storybook pages with chapter heads like “In Which Christopher Robin Gets Some Sad News” moving the story through an opening montage from Christopher Robin’s last party in the Hundred-Acre Wood to boarding school, the death of his father, marriage, the war, and so on.

Also like Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is full of melancholy and a wan approximation of the whimsical spirit of its literary inspiration. (As a point of comparison, the 2011 reboot The Muppets, with Jason Siegel and Amy Adams, had a similar melancholy tone, but nailed the whimsy.)

Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are sufficiently themselves to arouse our affections for these beloved characters, whether we know and love them principally from the A.A. Milne stories or from the best Disney cartoons, including the classic anthology The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and the latter-day 2011 Winnie the Pooh.

I love them both, and I’m glad that Christopher Robin doesn’t entirely take its bearings from the cartoons.

For one thing, while Jim Cummings continues his dead-on impressions of Sterling Holloway’s Pooh and Paul Winchell’s Tigger, no great effort has been made to reproduce the other familiar voices. I also appreciate that Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are rendered not as computer-animated animals, like Paddington, but as well-worn stuffed animals. (Rabbit and Owl, on the other hand, are real creatures of the Hundred-Acre Wood.)

On the other hand, the characters often sound like they’re just reprising their greatest hits. Many lines are familiar, although the film’s mantra, “Doing Nothing often leads to the very best Something,” is a suitably Milne-esque epigram that seems original to the film.

The 2011 Winnie the Pooh included a chapter about dealing with a nonexistent Heffalump, and in Christopher Robin, there’s a digression about battling a nonexistent Woozle — though the film winds up tagging Christopher’s boss at Winslow Luggage as a real-life Woozle.

Here’s the thing: Christopher already knew his boss was (semantics aside) a Woozle. He was resisting him from the outset. Why isn’t that worthy, too? Because he wasn’t confident and goofy while he did it? Give me the bravery of the 2003 Peter Pan’s Mr. Darling any day.

When a movie like Christopher Robin works, you want to surrender to its magic. I sat down to Christopher Robin hoping to surrender. Fifteen minutes in, I wanted to stage an intervention with the characters, which is not what happens when a movie like this works.

Reviewing Paddington 2, I observed that not only was Hollywood unable to make such movies, no one there really wanted to. For details, see Christopher Robin.

Article content The United Way has a new operations manager. Thursday was the first day for Meagan MacDonald Bingley and she admitted she has big shoes to fill. Bingley is Cornwall born and raised, and has spent most of her career in the insurance industry. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. United Way / Centraide of SDG welcomes new operations manager Back to video “I do have experience volunteering in the community,” she said. “I volunteered for different non-profit agencies. I was also heavily involved with the Chamber of Commerce as a past vice-president and I have been on the board for five years.” Bingley said it was through those networking opportunities she became much more involved in the community and she felt she was missing another challenge. “I wanted to create a bigger impact in our community and truly help individuals out,” she said. “So that’s why I put my name forward (for the position).” Bingley said it was a big decision to make, but she was really excited to be working with the United Way and had some ideas about fundraising and how things could change within the organization.

Article content “I’m figuring it out, I’m figuring out the role,” she said. “Knowing the board will be the first step. Lori (Greer) set a great path and she has big, big shoes to fill. I am very grateful to come after her.” Bingley said she was also really excited to be working with campaign chair Angie Baker. “Angie has been on the board for a number of years so that will be very helpful,” she said. Bingley said one of the biggest challenges she can see in her new position is to get the younger generation interested in the community. “The millennials, just trying to get them volunteering, participating,” she said. “That seems to be the challenge.” Bingley said she was also hoping to reach out to seniors who might donate to the United Way while in the workforce, but tend to forget about the agency once retired. “There are a lot of workplace campaigns and then the individuals retire and we want to keep them in the United Way,” she said. “Those are the two ends of the spectrum we want to reach.” Bingley said it was important to put out the educational component of the agency, to remind people what the United Way does and the member agencies it supports. “A lot of people in our community don’t know what these agencies do,” she said. “I think it is important for us to education and once people fully know what the United Way brings, it’s going to be easier to get that generation involved.” Bingley said while she wants to explore different fundraising initiatives, it is still in the planning stages.

209,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

But, there’s another, often overlooked elected office voters will have the opportunity to decide on. And, given the controversy surrounding school closures and sexual health education over the past year, the role of school board trustee may be getting more attention from voters come election day.

Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures Back to video Trustees represent the interests of their constituents on any of the four publicly funded school boards. They are not involved in the day-to-day aspect of running and managing a school, but do work heavily with the province, parents, educators, and students on many important matters that affect our communities. Voters in Cornwall won’t have much of a say in who their trustees are, for better or worse. All incumbents on the English public, English Catholic, French public, and French Catholic boards who represent Cornwall were acclaimed. In fact, all of the French-speaking trustees across Cornwall and SDG are acclaimed.

Article content However, in some rural communities, the race for trustee for the Upper Canada District School Board could be more high profile than most years. In Stormont and Glengarry, there will be an exciting three-way race. The incumbent will not be seeking re-election, leaving the job open. The Mayor of South Stormont, Jim Bancroft, who will be leaving the council table this fall, hopes to continuing serving with the school board. “I feel comfortable that it’s time to move on,” said Bancroft. “I hope the community will recognize that I care about the community, I believe our schools need to be represented as strong as we can.” He will be challenged by former student trustee Marshal Wilson. Wilson was involved with the board through the school closure process, which he credits as the main reason for why he became so intimately involved in the role. “The one thing that differentiates me, in my mind and with most people I talk to, is the type of experience I have,” said Wilson. “There’s no real learning curve for me. I’m already familiar with how the board works.” Also in the running in Stormont and Glengarry is John Danaher. Danaher is a retired principal, and has been familiar with the workings of the UCDSB for most of his life. He also has nine grandchildren currently in school. “Unfortunately education is very political,” said Danaher. “I think with the school closures, and I think with what’s coming forth with the change of [Provincial] government, if there are changes there, we have to be ready to work with them.”

Jeremy Armer, who could not be reached for comment at the time of publication, will be challenged by retired local principal Larry Berry. “I threw my name in because I’d like to be involved in education, I’m positive towards the board, I’m not axe-grinding. It’s a positive bid to become the trustee,” said Berry. Berry wanted to see someone become a staunch supporter of the smaller, rural schools in his district. He also wants to see boards support regular classroom teachers better, and encourage more physical activity among students, something he strongly supported during his time as an educator. Dundas voters (North and South) will also have the opportunity to elect a trustee to the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario, along with voters in Stormont who they share a district with. Incumbent Karen McAllister will be running against Donna Neilsen.

NEW YORK — Too much of the data available to track the world’s progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is outdated, said Claire Melamed, executive director of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.

“Some of this data we're using to monitor progress on SDGs were collected before the SDGs were even agreed on, and in a world of satellites and mobile phones it’s insane we’re in that position,” Melamed said in an interview ahead of her talk at an event called We the Future at Global Goals Week in New York.

While it may not be possible to know what is happening in real time, people should be able to get a sense of progress on the SDGs week after week, or at least month after month, she said.

“It’s about working with governments to see which of the indicators they’ve prioritized they would like more up-to-date data on and then starting to put together the partnerships that will help to deliver that,” she said.

Timeliness is just one half of the problem; the other is comprehensiveness, Melamed said.

Figures such as the estimated 263 million children out of school point to another major problem around data for the SDGs, which is that granular data about individuals is often nonexistent.

“We don’t get that number from actually counting children,” Melamed said. “We get that from counting a few children and estimating up from that to what we think the global figure is.”

One consequence of that system is that it fails to capture any additional information about the actual people the SDGs are meant to serve — in other words, the stories behind the data. People most in need are also the most likely to be absent from these headline figures.

“We know very little, not as much as we need to, about the actual children who are out of school. We don’t know how many of them are out of school because they’re looking after a sibling or they’ve been a victim of child marriage,” Melamed said.

Melamed was part of a major announcement this week on Data to End Hunger, the largest ever financial commitment on data for development, a partnership supported by donors from the United States, Germany, and Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and other partners, to produce data for agricultural development.

“Agriculture is key to achieving so many of the SDGs,” she said. “If we want to reduce poverty, if we want to reduce hunger, if we want to increase the number of jobs, all of those things depend on agriculture in the world’s poorest countries.”

The partnership comes in the wake of a report on food security and nutrition demonstrating how levels of hunger have risen for three consecutive years.

The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data consistently hears from governments that one of the things they need to solve this problem is better data, Melamed said. This new initiative seeks to use the power of data to boost the productivity of 500 million smallholder farmers across 50 countries by 2030, by working with existing government systems rather than launching a new database.

New technologies “make things faster and cheaper and give us the 3D picture of societies we’ve never been able to have before,” Melamed said.

Technologies work best when they are built on solid systems: A good census bureau, a civil registration system, a consistent household survey program, and the other basic building blocks of data all governments need.

Melamed pointed to this partnership as an example of growing awareness among donors that investment in basic data systems can reap rewards in many different ways.

“The challenge for all of us is, while we’re interested in having the right numbers now, we actually all know in the long run what we need is not the right numbers now, today … but the right systems to make sure we get the right numbers today and tomorrow and next week,” she said.

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

214,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-benchmarking-alliance-to-rank-companies-performance-on-sdgs/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Benchmarking Alliance to Rank Companies' Performance on SDGs,"24 September 2018: Aviva, the Index Initiative and the UN Foundation launched the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA), which will develop free, publicly available benchmarks that compare and rank companies’ performance on the SDGs. The Alliance aims to incentivize and accelerate private sector action on sustainable development.

Some companies have gone from partners to leaders in a race to the top.

During the launch event, which convened in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, Mark Wilson, Group CEO, Aviva, noted that the WBA’s objective is to make business the greatest force for good on our planet, but such an objective can only be met if CEOs, Boards and regulators think about the long term. Kathy Calvin, UN Foundation President and CEO, was among those underscoring the importance of private sector engagement, recognizing that some companies “have gone from partners to leaders” in a race to the top.

To trigger such a race, the WBA aims to increase transparency and accountability for businesses, and empower consumers, investors, governments and civil society to make decisions on where and how to spend money or allocate funds. Gerbrand Haverkamp, WBA Executive Director, notes that “the real value of benchmarks is that they will empower society to make decisions that are in line with societal values.” The WBA expects to have assessed 2,000 companies by 2023.

Five new benchmarks are being developed in collaboration with over 70 WBA Allies, to be published in 2020, for:

Climate and energy Seafood Food and agriculture Gender equality and empowerment Digital inclusion

A post on the WBA website by Aviva’s Pauliina Murphy highlights that the benchmarks are “neither opt-in, nor opt-out.” Companies that have the largest impacts on sustainability, she notes, will be within the scope of the measurements, with the results being used to facilitate dialogues between investors and companies that spur behavior changes, eventually spotlighting the best and worst performers. As noted in the launch event’s press release, the WBA is working to “create a market that rewards corporate leadership while challenging those that lag behind.”

Martin Bille Hermann, Denmark’s State Secretary for Development Policy, emphasized that the rules by which companies play need to change such that they follow a “17-discipline game” which incorporates the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable development. Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands’ Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, similarly noted that companies need to deliver on a wide range of corporate responsibility issues including due diligence, access to justice, human rights and protection of the environment.

The launch follows a year of international consultations and roundtable discussions, which contributed to a ‘Final Consultation Publication.’ The publication describes: the WBA’s establishment and initial dialogues on SDG-focused benchmarks; the importance of young people to the sustainability agenda; SDG corporate benchmarks on “leaving no company behind”; developing the methodology to build a set of benchmarks; and intersections between industries and the SDGs.

Among other activities, participants celebrated the winners of the Stockholm Water Prize and the Stockholm Junior Water Prize.

World Water Week attracted a record number of 3,700 participants. It opened with calls for nature-based solutions, such as “green infrastructure” in cities, to protect and restore water resources. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, in her opening address, highlighted ways to spread the risk from water-related disasters in a more equitable manner, and urged all concerned to be involved in actions for addressing the world’s water crisis.

Torgny Homgren, SIWI Executive Director, declared that water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world. Other speakers referred to examples where water scarcity has contributed to poverty, conflict, and the spread of waterborne diseases, as well as hindering access to education for women and girls.

The UNFCCC, in a press release, noted the pressures exerted by climate change on food security and health around the world, adding that water scarcity also calls into question the future of water-intensive energy production.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 launched a set of global baseline reports during World Water Week, bringing together work undertaken through the World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

On the proportion of wastewater that is safely treated (SDG indicator 6.3.1), the WHO and UN Habitat report that, based on data from 79 countries, only 59% of domestic wastewater is collected and safely treated, while insufficient information is available to estimate the level of industrial wastewater treatment.

Water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world, said SIWI Executive Director, Torgny Homgren.

On ambient water quality (SDG indicator 6.3.2), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) finds that, based on 52 submissions, more than half the water bodies assessed are of good quality. However, the authors propose mapping of trends in water quality to indicate whether water bodies are improving, stable or degrading, noting that it is not practical to set universal parameters of water quality.

Regarding progress on water-use efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) notes that average water-use efficiency currently stands at around US$15/m3 worldwide, though there are significant differences among countries and regions.

On the level of water stress (SDG indicator 6.4.2), FAO reports that water stress increased between 1996 and 2016 for most countries in the world, and has more than doubled in 26 countries, 15 of which are in Africa.

On the degree of integrated water resource management (IWRM) implementation (SDG indicator 6.5.1), UN Environment reports that 80% of countries have laid the foundations to establish IWRM, but that 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve the target of implementing IWRM at all levels by 2030 (SDG target 6.5). Hence, the report notes, multi-level coordination and collective, multi-stakeholder measures will be critical.

On the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement for water cooperation (SDG indicator 6.5.2), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) find insufficient progress, and propose undertaking joint projects that alleviate poverty and conflict, in tandem with water-related objectives.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG indicator 6.6.1), a report published by UN Environment on behalf of UN-Water notes that, while severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 is slow. The report calls for “significantly upscaling” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

World Water Week celebrated innovations in the field of water treatment. Stockholm Water Prize laureates Bruce Rittmann and Mark van Loosdrecht were recognized for their work in biotechnology-based processes to treat drinking water and waste water, while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment. A ceremony highlighted the contribution of the two scientists to better understanding how microorganisms can transform organic pollutants in water. Kartik Chandran, World Water Prize Committee, noted in a blog post the potential of environmental biotechnology not only for improving drinking water and recycling or purifying wastewater, but also in interacting with complex biological systems to enable the achievement of goals in energy, food, and human health.

Also honored during World Water Week were the winners of the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, Caleb Liow Jia Le and Johnny Xiao Hong Yu from Singapore. The two teenagers have developed a way to produce reduced grapheme oxide, which can purify water, using locally available durian rind and sugarcane fiber.

216,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-2030-strategy-and-global-partnership-initiative-for-youth/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches 2030 Strategy and Global Partnership Initiative for Youth,"24 September: A day before the opening of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level General Debate, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres unveiled Youth 2030, a strategy reflecting the UN’s new commitment to working with and for young people. Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

217,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/kofi-annan-and-the-transition-to-sustainable-development-goals/,"Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Kofi Annan and the Transition to Sustainable Development Goals,"As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006. His achievements helped set the stage for the set of 17 universal sustainable development goals and 169 targets we have today. This brief looks at the SDG era that Annan helped usher in vis-à-vis his efforts to set and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as his vision for exceeding their ambition.

A proponent of people pushing their governments to act, Annan established the UN Millennium Campaign with an aim “to mobilize the world around the MDGs” and “rally all people” to make poverty history. Having founded the precursor to the SDG Action Campaign and collective efforts such as the upcoming Global Goals Week, Annan’s memory and work continue to live on.

A “committed internationalist,” Annan’s self-described greatest achievement was the MDGs, the first set of global targets to improve human development and ensure social well-being. Although the Millennium Declaration was signed by all 189 UN Member States in 2000, Annan convened a group of experts to ensure the Declaration led to action, tasking them with crafting what became the eight MDGs. The effort received criticism for being non-inclusive and yet another attempt by developed countries to decide “what was best for the rest of the world.” It reflects the opinion that Annan’s leadership style was “all general and no secretary.” But the MDGs offered a focus for development efforts and provided proof of concept that, when financial institutions, government aid agencies and other donors use a single framework to channel their efforts and guide action on shared objectives, targeted progress can be achieved.

Skeptics and globalists alike have questioned whether accelerating global progress on goal areas such as poverty reduction, health and education can be attributed to the MDGs. For example, China’s rapid economic growth is often credited with helping the world achieve the first MDG target on halving extreme poverty, but China is said to have paid “no attention” to the framework. Conversely, Africa’s increased growth rates, although uneven within and between countries, is often attributed to donor efforts and other MDG-aligned investments. Regardless of shortcomings on the goal-setting process, the Secretary-General’s personal style, or difficulties attributing improved well-being to the MDGs, Annan’s work helped set a guiding vision that articulated a world for which society should strive.

Always Forward-thinking

Drafted in 2000, the MDGs as we know them today effectively came into prominence during the 2002 UN International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD), called for by Kofi Annan and held in Monterrey, Mexico. In part due to Annan’s collaborating with an “unusually wide” set of actors, the summit resulted in the setting of a target whereby developed countries would contribute 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries. At the summit, Annan highlighted an increasing interdependence between rich and poor, stating, “we live in one world, not two… no one in this world can be comfortable or safe while so many are suffering and deprived.”

But Annan was not merely satisfied with commitments to increase aid. Prior to the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland he emphasized that “responsibility flows both ways” and “rich and poor alike must do their part.” This thinking has helped to shift discussions towards overcoming the North-South divide, and towards bringing high-income countries into the development agenda as more than just providers of finance. This convergence of countries working together towards a “shared destiny” is a key pillar of the 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015.

Ever forward-looking, a 2002 address by Annan framed sustainable development not as a burden or lifestyle reduction for developed nations, but as an opportunity that could “build markets and create jobs” – an opportunity that was quantified nearly 15 years later at more than US$12 trillion. Annan’s understanding of this opportunity, and that it would require collaborative efforts by diverse actors, is reflected in his 1999 proposal for and the subsequent launch of the UN Global Compact.

Looking Back to Look Ahead

Comprehending the scope and complexity of the SDGs can be aided by taking a look into the past. Returning to China’s experiences, development experts know which sectors in China grew fastest, who in the country benefitted, and what the consequences for the planet have been. We understand the gaps left by the MDGs and remaining challenges, such as on integrating environmental targets, ensuring action by all, and including good governance. We recognize that these issues, similar to economic growth and other standalone SDGs, can serve as launchpads for the others, and that progress in some areas may be pursued in ways that negate gains elsewhere.

Like the MDGs, the SDGs do not have an implementation guide, a project budget or an organizational chart that maps out responsibilities. The framework does, however, provide a common language for actors from every sector of society and region of the world to come together on shared challenges. In 2013, Brookings’ John McArthur penned an article on what the MDGs had accomplished, noting that previously, “there was no common framework for promoting global development.” The need to fill such a gap also speaks to the impetus behind the SDGs. At the turn of the millennium, rich countries were looking inward amidst a civil society backlash against globalization, with major multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund facing protests in the streets.

Society’s Next Steps and Annan’s Mark on the Transition to SDGs

A Financial Times article acknowledges that Annan’s “trademark optimism does sometimes seem misplaced in our turbulent times.” However, such optimism, as on display in his 2010 Der Spiegel Q&A, is a prerequisite to tackling the ambitious sustainable development agenda toward which global society has agreed to strive. Even if laggards remain, Annan noted in March 2017 that “the rest of the world will continue.” As demonstrated by the global response to the US announcing its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, Kofi was right.

Annan also noted in Der Spiegel that building on lessons from the MDG era requires addressing root causes of key problems such as poverty, energy supply and climate change. With the SDGs’ ambition to “get to zero” on poverty and hunger, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the AAAA, the 2015 agreements represent a “triumph for multilateralism” that still guides Member State actions, even if some are retreating. Complemented by initiatives such as Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), which launched in 2011 and fed into the 2015 agreements, processes that Annan helped convene will continue to support the tackling of root causes. It is these root causes—ranging from gender and socioeconomic inequality to economic instability or marginalization to policy incoherence and siloed decision-making—that threaten the achievement of shared societal objectives.

Annan highlights a key lesson of the MDG era in the foreword of a 2015 paper: that the world’s challenges “cannot be achieved in isolation.” At a side event during the 2015 UN Summit to adopt the SDGs, Carlos Lopes described the need to move away from a “cappuccino approach” to development in which economic growth serves as the espresso base. Indeed, moving from MDGs to universal SDGs requires an integrated approach by all countries that cuts across economic, social and environmental pillars.

It is well-known that the SDGs demand action across the whole-of-society, supported by a wide range of means of implementation, including trade, technology transfer, data, capacity building and finance. Highlighting the importance of data to ending malnutrition in Africa, Annan continued to foster and promote the development of new tools that facilitate integrated SDG implementation and shift development paradigms. Similarly, on finance, mobilizing the private sector and “shifting the trillions” requires actors to be aligned with the spirit and principles of the 2030 Agenda. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI), launched in 2006 with Annan’s backing, offer a ready-made system to align institutional investors with the SDGs.

As one article reflected after Annan’s passing in August, if you care about the SDGs, then Kofi Annan “has played an important role in your work.” As members of the global community convene in New York for the 73rd UN General Assembly and largest-ever Global Goals Week, Annan’s legacy will be present in the ideals, spirit and foundational tools that are driving us towards the world we need.","As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006.
His achievements helped set the stage for the set of 17 universal sustainable development goals and 169 targets we have today.
This brief looks at the SDG era that Annan helped usher in vis-à-vis his efforts to set and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as his vision for exceeding their ambition.
A “committed internationalist,” Annan’s self-described greatest achievement was the MDGs, the first set of global targets to improve human development and ensure social well-being.
Highlighting the importance of data to ending malnutrition in Africa, Annan continued to foster and promote the development of new tools that facilitate integrated SDG implementation and shift development paradigms."

The publication titled, ‘Progress on Water-related Ecosystems: Piloting the Monitoring Methodology and Initial Findings for SDG Indicator 6.6.1,’ finds that, over the past 100 years, the world is estimated to have lost half its natural wetlands and with this a significant number of freshwater species.

The report emphasizes the value of monitoring and reporting progress on SDG target 6.6, which aims to, “by 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes” through indicator 6.6.1 (tracking changes in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time), while considering the current state and trends of the world’s water-related ecosystems. The publication presents the first collection of country results that were gathered during the pilot testing of the indicator 6.6.1 methodology, including the use of globally available data from Earth observations. It also outlines how the methodology has evolved through its piloting phase, documenting the lessons learned from country outreach activities into an Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs (IAEG-SDG) Tier II indicator methodology.

The publication finds that severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people. The loss in natural wetlands is estimated at 42% in Africa, 32% in Asia, 35% in Europe, 59% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 17% in North America, and 12% in Oceania.

Countries should “significantly upscale” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

According to the report, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 data is slow. It explains that the piloting phase for indicator 6.6.1 revealed significant capacity challenges in monitoring and reporting the changes within water-related ecosystems. It highlights that satellite-based data have an important role to play in filling data gaps, and thus can support decision making in advancing national progress towards achieving target 6.6. The publication underscores that countries should “significantly upscale” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

The report is one of a series of seven reports launched during World Water Week that track progress towards the various targets of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

The project reports on individual and aggregate governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law; and control of corruption. The indicator data set is updated yearly.



In an FAQ on the WGI website, the project notes that in order to infer trends and identify changes over time, users must explore the underlying data, which is publicly available and can be downloaded from the website.

The WGI defines governance as the “traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised,” including the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced, government capacity to formulate and implement sound policies and respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions. The WGI provides measures for each of these dimensions of governance.

On voice and accountability, for instance, the WGI measure reflects the perceptions of the extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting their government as well as measures on freedom of association, freedom of expression and a free media. Rule of law measures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, particularly as they relate to contract enforcement, property rights, the police and courts and the likelihood of crime and violence.

Users can access the WGI’s updated interactive data access tool to select graphs, data, time series and country views. The time series view, for instance, allows users to view each indicator score between 1996 to 2017 to see changes over time. Users can also display any of the six aggregate WGI measures as a world map and move over the map to identify countries’ aggregate WGI indicator. Similarly, users can view any two of the six aggregate WGO measures on two world maps.

The WGI are based on over 30 individuals data sources provided by a survey of international organizations, non-government organizations, think tanks, private sector firms and other institutes in industrial and developing countries. The indicators cover the period 1996-2016. [WGI website]","21 September 2018: The World Bank Group released the 2018 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI).

The authors note that ensuring that no one will be left behind entails “taking explicit action to end extreme poverty, curb inequalities, confront discrimination,” as well as fast-tracking progress for those who are most marginalized.

The UNDP paper titled, ‘What Does It Mean to Leave No One Behind?,’ aims to stimulate dialogue and help generate consensus on delivering the leave no one behind agenda. The authors distinguish absolute deprivation from relative disadvantage, but note that both hinder peoples’ choices and capabilities to participate in or benefit from human development. The paper asserts that the disadvantages people face can be understood through a framework of five factors:

the discrimination they face;

where they live (geography);

socio-economic status;

how they are governed; and

vulnerability to shocks.

The paper also highlights the importance of intersectionality, as multiple factors often lead to a combination of disadvantages. Given the complex, multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the paper makes the case for a “holistic response” that “considers the severity and overlaps between different types of deprivation.” The authors also assert that all countries – even while data sets may be incomplete – have “some degree of evidence” of each of the five types of disadvantages.

By looking at these factors and three “mutually reinforcing levers,” the paper outlines how UNDP can support countries to: examine why people are left behind; empower those people; and enact change through policies, reforms and other interventions. Given the urgency of SDG achievement and leaving no one behind, the authors call for acting simultaneously on all three levers of change.

Within these workstreams, UNDP is undertaking assessments to gather evidence and strengthen national capacities, expanding opportunities for civil society, and building local governance systems that reduce inequality and exclusion. The framework is intended to inform both UN Country Teams’ public-facing work and that of national partners, as well as “the manner in which UNDP designs, implements, monitors and evaluates” projects.

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner previewed some of the framework’s learnings during a side event at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including the notion that “averages hide a lot of very brutal truth.” Convened by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the event reviewed 86 countries’ readiness to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda. Steiner also underscored that “we are not starting from zero,” as the development community has years of understanding on the issue, which has informed related UNDP initiatives such as the agency’s Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) work, which supports partner countries in their efforts to implement the SDGs.

The HLPF also featured a set of eight Voluntary National Review (VNR) Labs convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), with Lab 2 focusing on leaving no one behind. Feeding into the Labs, the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) released publications related to the concept of leave no one behind.

222,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iucn-launches-alliance-for-freshwater/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IUCN Launches Alliance for Freshwater,"6 September 2018: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has launched a global network aimed at halting and reversing the ongoing freshwater biodiversity loss crisis. Its core focus is to develop a global community of practice for freshwater biodiversity conservation in order to foster collaborations for the design and implementation of large‐scale conservation actions.

The ‘Alliance for Freshwater Life’ was launched by the IUCN Freshwater Biodiversity Unit during the World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden. The initiative is an interdisciplinary network of scientists, conservation professionals, educators, policy experts, creative practitioners, and citizens working to improve the conservation and sustainable use of freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity.

The Alliance published a paper titled, ‘A Global Call to Unite Efforts for Freshwater Biodiversity Science and Conservation,’ as a manifesto for positive action for freshwater biodiversity conservation and policy. The paper outlines the Alliance’s vision of a global collaboration between national and international organizations as well as individuals.

The publication notes that freshwater vertebrate populations have declined by more than 80% over the past 50 years, a rate of decline twice that recorded for either marine or terrestrial systems. According to the article, approximately one third of the 28,000 freshwater species assessed for the IUCN Red List are threatened with extinction, while an estimated three quarters of the world’s inland natural wetlands were lost during the 20th century.

The sacrifice of freshwater life as “collateral damage” in global development can result in the destruction of the very ecosystems required to support the development objectives.

The paper highlights that the SDGs include targets: to protect and restore water‐related ecosystems (Target 6.1); to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, and their services (Target 15.1); and to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species (Target 15.5). The targets are for delivery in 2030 (6.1) and, “alarmingly,” as early as 2020 (15.1 and 15.5).

The authors identify two key drivers of the ongoing crisis of freshwater biodiversity loss: the significant growth in global demand for water resources over the last century, which led to widespread freshwater habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and over-abstractions; and the fact that existing environmental policies do not adequately protect freshwater biodiversity and ecosystems.

Noting that global demands for drinking water, hydropower, and agriculture will increase significantly in coming decades, the publication cautions that the “human valuation and usefulness” of freshwaters are often foregrounded in environmental policy, at the detriment of non-human life. The authors explain that this often leads to the sacrifice of freshwater life as “collateral damage” in global development, which can result in the destruction of the very ecosystems required to support the development objectives.

The paper outlines five key areas of work to be undertaken by the Alliance to raise the public and political profile of freshwater issues: research, data, conservation, education and outreach, and policy. Where policies are already in place, the authors note, such as the SDGs or the water‐related Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Alliance will help to make available the relevant scientific knowledge and highlight the importance of functioning freshwater ecosystems for fulfilling other related SDGs, such as poverty alleviation (SDG 1).

223,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/convention-on-biological-diversity-overcoming-research-impediments/,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Convention on Biological Diversity: Overcoming Research Impediments,"Success of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) depends on our understanding of biodiversity. Hence, CBD and the subsequent Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (NP) urge signatory nations to promote and encourage research on biodiversity. However, imposition of sovereign rights of nations on their biological resources and the emphasis on the CBD third objective of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources (GR) through access and benefit-sharing (ABS) are coming in the way of achieving the primary objectives of the CBD relating to conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use.

In the meantime, examples of financially significant ABS agreements are scarce even after a quarter century of existence of the CBD. A survey of megadiverse countries having functional ABS legislation showed that very few commercial ABS agreements (2.05 per year per country) have been concluded, suggesting a lack of demand for GR by potential users. Instead, the regulations to harness perceived benefits by individual countries have made much needed biodiversity exploration and research difficult and in some cases even impossible. The global research community has been complaining about the challenges they face in accessing and exchanging biological material for research as well as international collaborations that are crucial for the global food security and conservation of biodiversity.

No Substitute for Sharing of Biological Resources

Biological resources being truly renewable, their use promotes further improvement and ex situ conservation as in the case of crop plants. Use of any biological resource in a given area does not limit its use elsewhere. However, throughout the negotiations in the run up to the CBD and NP, biological resources were treated akin to non-renewable resources such as oil and coal.

The principles underlying the CBD and NP are laudable, and both underscore that access to GR should also address the issues of equity. However, with the third CBD objective of ABS making a slip, it is becoming evident that the CBD and NP may not be able to address the issues of equity raised by developing countries at the Earth Summit in 1992, which ultimately culminated in nationalization of genetic resources. As governments began to enact national legislation to regulate access to biological resources within their borders for benefit-sharing from the derived products, consequences of such actions on biodiversity research and food security are being overlooked. The principal victim of these legislative actions is biodiversity research that includes inventories and international collaborations as its core. Such restrictions, apart from curtailing research and development, run counter to the objectives of the CBD. Enormous amounts of biological data, including Digital Sequence Information (DSI), are increasingly being published via the database portals of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). The unlimited and open access DSI encourages collaboration among researchers besides enabling conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. As access to DSI is coming to the center stage of negotiations in the forthcoming 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, the global research community is increasingly concerned about the free flow of information, which is essential for the advancement of science.

New Treaty for Non-profit Research and Development

Not-for-profit research, such as inventories and taxonomic studies, intended for the public domain, should be differentiated from commercial research leading to proprietary rights. On the one hand, access has to be open when the benefits are in the public domain, and the providers of the biological resource are free to make use of the benefits just as anybody else. On the other hand, if the benefits are confined to the private realm through intellectual property rights, the provider may secure a share bilaterally.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), popularly known as the “Seed Treaty,” provides a promising model for international collaboration on biodiversity research. The treaty ensures worldwide public accessibility to GR of essential food and fodder crops. While the CBD and NP necessitate access to GR on a bilateral basis through case-by-case negotiations, the Seed Treaty adopts a multilateral system for ABS (MLS) through a Standard Material Transfer Agreement, averting the need for bilateral negotiations. The MLS established under the Seed Treaty has been viewed as a very successful model in terms of volume of material exchanged (8,500 transfers every week) in contrast to the very limited performance of the bilateral system of the CBD and NP. Exchange of genetic material under the Seed Treaty is exempted from the NP requirements, and the benefit sharing requirement arises only when access for further research and breeding is restricted through intellectual property rights. One possible course of action for the CBD COP might be to add a legally binding treaty to promote and facilitate biodiversity research, conservation and international collaboration. Such a treaty could address legal uncertainties in the governance of global research commons such as microbial culture collections held by the World Federation of Culture Collections as well as DSI published through the portals of INSDC or taxonomic type materials held in various museums all over the world.

Intrinsically, GR is a public resource – truly renewable, non-rivalrous and non-exclusive – much similar to the knowledge resources. Its dissemination across national boundaries further enriches their diversity, value and conservation. For example, cultivation of a crop variety in a region does not limit its use elsewhere. Thus, it is imperative that GR are retained as common heritage. Man, as a biological species, depends more or less on the same GR for survival, irrespective of the national boundaries. Open access to GR addresses the issues of equity by ensuring access to biological resources for all. This advocates the universal freedom to study, distribute, modify and utilize GR by any one and for any purpose. As in the case of open source software licenses, many forms of free and open access licenses can be conceived for GR too. The open access model offers people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of GR with stipulation that the same rights should be preserved in derivative works in the future.

Biodiversity forms the basis of global food and livelihood security, and the nations of the world are linked in a complex web of genetic interdependence that ensures global food security. Countries have gained much more than their individual contributions through the exchange and sharing of a myriad kinds of crops and domestic animals from all over the world. Similarly, international collaboration is inevitable for understanding life on earth, its conservation and sustainable use. The objectives of the CBD are interlinked with the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and three SDGs in particular: SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). It is time that the forthcoming CBD COP take stock of the impacts of parochial restrictions on open access and free exchange of biological resources due to the NP and national ABS regimes, and adopt the necessary course correction to help achieve sustainable development for all.

This article is brought to you thanks to the strategic cooperation of The European Sting with the World Economic Forum. Author: Carolien de Bruin, CEO and founder, C-Change & Josephine Damstra, Partnership lead, C-Change & Dave Prescott, Senior Associate, The Partnering Initiative (TPI) We invite you to visit the streets of New York during the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the annual meeting where leaders from across the world, from all sectors and all impact domains, come together to expedite their progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These leaders and their entourages converge on the same stretches of congested, restricted-access roads. Traffic barely moves and a lack of signposting means they often struggle to determine the conversations in which to take part and whom to join in action.

The physical traffic situation during the UNGA is a fitting metaphor for the state of the online infrastructure that underpins the sustainable development agenda today. Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing. A CEO survey by PwC suggests in 2015 only 13% corporate CEOs had the tools in place to measure their impact against the SDGs. While we believe that this number has since shifted, delivery barriers still exist and will be apparent in public sector and civil society organizations alike.

Meanwhile, C-Change research has found 200 online platforms dedicated to facilitating learning, collaboration or the channelling of financial and non-financial support towards sustainability. Few have reached the critical mass needed to do so effectively and at scale, while many exist in isolation or even operate in competition with one another. The result is a fragmented, sub-scale system. TPI has found a similar pattern in its work supporting the development of in-country platforms dedicated to encouraging multi-stakeholder partnerships for the SDGs.

This infrastructure gap results in a reality where not enough is known about actual, on-the-ground needs and solutions, or where much needed, collaborative action agendas fall flat. It also means that essential capital doesn’t reach the businesses or organizations that deliver these solutions or that they fail to go the last mile in achieving measurable results. Resources go to waste and we are back in a congested traffic situation, with hundreds of actors getting lost, stuck without fuel or arriving late at their destination.

We believe the current situation is untenable and unnecessary. Untenable as we are getting dangerously close to doing irreparable damage to our world and urgently need new tools of the trade that effectively shift behaviours and enable sustainable decision-making; unnecessary, as we collectively have the resources, skills, and technologies to do so. It is high time we collectively bring our SDG infrastructure and online systems into the 21st century.

Our five-point transformation plan is simple in intention but ambitious in scope:

1. Universal standards, tools and definitions

In a recent blog post, the Omidyar Network calls for shared definitions, tools, standards and data to help investors navigate an increasingly diverse impact market. We agree and would add that the same is true across the development field, where efforts to build platforms for multistakeholder collaboration too often lack alignment. Such alignment between platforms is critical to ensure capital flows to the most effective investment opportunities. It is also needed to create the maps that allow individual actors and consortia to carve out their paths and destinations. Efforts such as those by the Impact Management Project (IMP) and the World Benchmarking Alliance, who collectively consulted more than 1,000 organizations from all sectors on effective ways to evaluate impact, are critical to achieving such alignment. The UN has an important role to play in translating such standards to the SDG framework.

2. A shared, interoperable SDG backbone and open architecture

An easy mistake to make in the world of collaboration and platform development is launching a new solution with the intention of immediately becoming a ‘platform of platforms’. Addressing fragmentation by adding a new solution can hardly be the answer. Treating today’s vast universe of online SDG hubs and platforms as unique and independent, while bringing in place the backbone infrastructure and protocols that enable aggregation and content exchange can be a solution.

Efforts, such as the UN’s API Highways initiative, are great first steps, yet more needs to happen to make it easy and worthwhile for online platforms all over the world to feed into and contribute to a shared backbone. A joining of forces between smaller specialist sustainable solution providers and tech giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, or Google – given their existing reach, platform strength, and ability to set standards – will be important.

3. (Wise) use of frontier technologies

Exacerbated by a scarcity of tech expertise and financial resources, we would argue that the role of technology as a lever of change is underutilized and often an inhibitor to impact when solutions are ineffectively implemented or managed. This is equally true for the use of established technologies and those that have emerged as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or blockchain.

Large companies are showing the way forward here. We seeing blockchain used to promote sustainability goals, with examples such as Coca-Cola’s work with the US State Department on forced labour or Unilever and Sainsbury’s work with tea smallholders. Much can be done to take advantage of these frontier technologies as well as “bread and butter” technologies to establish a decentralized, disintermediating and more intelligent SDG environment that includes greater transparency, efficiency and decentralized data ownership.

Multiple “tech for good” coalitions (e.g. Consensys’ Blockchain for Social Impact and UNDP’s Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development) have begun to explore ways to do so. Such coalitions have an important role to play in building the right bridges between tech and sustainability, surfacing tech solutions that actually work and – especially in a world of blockchain mania – maintain a sense of realism while ‘SDG coins’ pop up left and right.

4. Human-centred design

Deep engagement, collaboration or investment is rarely the result of technology alone. Effective solutions require the integration of both human and tech factors. Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab put his finger on this when he stated that: “In the end, it all comes down to people and values. We need to shape a future that works for all of us by putting people first and empowering them.”

Putting this design principle at the heart of all development efforts and ensuring that a cadre of leaders and individuals stands that is fluent in both tech and sustainability are involved is important.

5. A pooling of resources

An important inhibitor of the use of technology in support of the SDGs has been a lack of resources or, as some argue, insufficient investment in an infrastructure to enable its use. While the tide has begun to turn, the capital that is available (grant or investment) to bring in the right solutions has not been at the level required to truly unblock the system.

This is not surprising: a number of failed platforms and the need for a long investment horizon to achieve the financial returns on such solutions make many hesitant to commit. Our solution? Pool efforts to bring the capital and non-financial resources together that are needed to support those solutions that collectively lead to the standards and decentralized, interoperable systems so critical for SDG success.

To deliver on this plan, the UN has a unique role to play in “corralling the troops” in support of a shared SDG tech agenda or blueprint, but also in getting providers and partners to adhere to open architecture protocols and standards. Governments and philanthropic institutions with an interest in stimulating collaboration and private sector investment in the SDGs must do the same and support solutions that contribute to a more navigable system.

To individual platforms we say: don’t build a new platform when the need to do so is not clear. And, when you do, use the systems that already exist – which is the case nine times out of 10 – and align to the protocols that enable an exchange of content.","Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing.

This edition of “the magazine of the United Nations” focuses on the SDGs, and examines actions the UN has taken in its “lead role in advancing the 2030 Agenda.”

The articles cover topics that do not always feature prominently when discussing SDG implementation, such as disarmament and sexual violence. Pramila Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, highlights gender-based violence, which she describes as the “missing dimension” of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Patten links sexual violence to a human rights-based approach and the “leave no one behind” principle. She notes that “when war erupts, and the threat of rape at gunpoint becomes a pervasive terror,” women are unable to access fields, marketplaces and water points, and that girls are unable to attend school. Patten further highlights the disproportionate economic and health impacts of war on women, connecting to the majority of the SDGs. She also flags the importance of time: whereas men can invest hours in work, education or civic engagement, women—especially in developing countries—are often burdened with unpaid labor such as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Patten closes by calling on countries to legislate gender equality not only as a moral and social justice imperative, but also a smart economic choice.

Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, discusses the nexus between disarmament, arms control and development, outlining the linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and noting that the issue and its connection to development are not new. She references Article 26 of the UN Charter and points readers to the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament launched on 24 May 2018, which aims to take the issue out of its “narrow, isolated security lens.” Nakamitsu stresses the importance of disarmament to achieving SDG targets 16.1 (reduce all forms of violence and related death rates) and 16.a (develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions), and flags that disarmament is explicitly recognized in SDG target 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows). She also draws linkages to Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), (5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed follows by arguing that success on the SDGs will be “measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind.” Doing so, she notes, entails providing a voice and platform for meaningful participation and engagement, particularly by the most marginalized and vulnerable. To make this a reality, Mohammed calls for six elements to be put in place, including: making the SDGs better known in society; investing in more transparent and accountable institutions; creating appropriate spaces for young people and fostering their ideas and leadership potential; and connecting overlapping agendas.

It is the tenth country and first small island development State (SIDS) to submit a long-term strategy (LTS) to decarbonize to the UNFCCC Secretariat in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The document titled, ‘Tile Til Eo 2050 Climate Strategy: Lighting the Way,’ provides the basis for increasing the ambition level of country’s existing Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which it plans to do before 2020. The Marshall Islands is the first country to confirm it will “unequivocally” raise ambition.

The strategy, which is the result of a two-year domestic and donor consultation process, emphasizes adaptation, including through recommending the development of a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) by 2019. It also includes economy-wide recommendations for reducing emissions across the electricity, waste and transportation sectors, highlights gender and social considerations, and suggests embedding the strategy in national legislation and a regular five-year review.

The strategy was launched in New York, US, at the opening ceremony of Climate Week NYC, which is meeting from 24-30 September, and ahead of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) Leaders’ week. Speaking at the launch, Hilda Heine, President of the Marshall Islands, said that, to keep the global temperature rise to below 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, every country must increase the ambition of existing targets by 2020 and lay out a long-term pathway to net zero emissions by 2050.

The Marshall Islands is the first country to confirm it will “unequivocally” raise ambition.

To achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and 100% renewable energy, as well as to adapt to the impacts of climate change and increase resilience, the Marshall Islands’ LTS recommends submitting, by 2020, a new NDC, which, inter alia:

revises the country’s quantified economy-wide target to reduce emissions to at least 32% below 2010 levels by 2025;

commits to a quantified economy-wide target to reduce emissions to at least 45% below 2010 levels by 2030;

communicates an indicative target to reduce emissions by at least 58% below 2010 levels by 2035;

commits to producing a NAP by the end of 2019 that sets out short-, medium- and long-term milestones to adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to climate resilience, and includes a plan to generate the necessary financing; and

commits to a gender-responsive and human rights-based approach in all NDC-related planning, programming and implementation.

The LTS also recommends, among other things:

focusing on the country’s electricity sector to implement emission reductions consistent with achieving its NDC targets;

reducing the growing waste problem by minimizing organic material in collected waste and generating energy from waste;

developing polices to encourage more use of public transport, cycling, walking and electric vehicles;

exploring options to reduce emissions from domestic ocean-based transport;

continuing phasing out the use of kerosene for lighting;

developing a long-term finance strategy to implement the LTS; and

including health education, training and public awareness considerations in the country’s NAP.

LTSs are critical for achieving climate goals as they help countries align national development goals with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and serve as a roadmap for future NDCs, which must become increasingly more ambitious. They also: provide credibility and certainty that the goals of the Paris Agreement can be achieved; increase transparency and trust among Parties; inform national level short- and medium-term political and economic cycles; and provide political certainty to stimulate private sector action. Benin, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Mexico, the US, the UK and Ukraine have already submitted LTSs.

The step-by-step guide titled, ‘Strengthening the Business Case for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: How to Measure Value for Your Business,’ enables companies to calculate the business value of WASH interventions and estimate their financial return on investment (ROI).

Launching the guide, WaterAid cited estimates that every US$1 invested in sanitation returns US$5.5 in increased productivity, and every US$1 invested in drinking water supply returns US$2.

The non-governmental organization (NGO) stated that progressive companies now view WASH as a “core business” priority, rather than considering it a part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or philanthropic action. For example, ensuring better WASH services results in fewer worker sick days and greater efficiency of operations. The guide seeks to meet the need of companies to provide robust evidence of the financial value of investing in WASH.

WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, and greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains.

Previous research conducted by WaterAid showed that, while many multi-national companies did have WASH policies in the workplace, there was typically less attention given to WASH in the supply chain and in workers’ homes.

The guide proposes six steps for measuring the business value of WASH interventions: 1) understanding the “impact pathway” in terms of the anticipated outcomes and impacts for people, communities and businesses; 2) identifying what to measure and how; 3) establishing a baseline; 4) implementing and monitoring WASH interventions; 5) analyzing data and measuring benefits; and 6) communicating the results.

The agency notes that WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains, and better stakeholder relationships for companies.

The guide was created and published in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Many other companies and international organizations contributed to developing the guide, including Diageo, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Sainsbury’s, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and CARE International, among others.

WaterAid and partners launched the guide on 30 August at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden.

The awards event took place at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, with the ceremony hosted by Loyiso Madinga, a South African comedian from The Daily Show. Madinga and other speakers emphasized the uniquely important role of young people in solving problems and bringing people together, and of reaching across generations.

Johar’s poem was featured in a film, ‘We the Goalkeepers,’ screened at the start of the awards night. The poem concludes, “Because when you’re too tired of waiting on others/ to save the day/ You stand tall, and show that saving the world/ is child’s play.”

Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Progress Award to Dysmus Kusilu, founder of Solar Freeze. Kusilu said that growing up in Kenya, he was taught that to work in agriculture is to be a failure. Gaining inspiration from his “sweet grandmother and her sacrifices,” he decided to turn failure into success by inventing a pay-as-you-go service using mobile phones to help smallholder farmers store their produce more efficiently and increase their yields.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the audience of the UN’s launch of two youth initiatives earlier in the day: the Youth 2030 strategy and Generation Unlimited. She said the initiatives will put youth at the forefront of the UN’s work “in a more earnest way” than ever before. Among the areas of leadership shown by young people recently, she said the march towards gender equality and ending sexual harassment is “one of the loudest cries I’ve heard.”

Mohammed presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Changemaker Award to Nadia Murad, an advocate for the Yazidi community and genocide survivors. Murad said that following the 2014 attacks by ISIS to “ethnically cleanse” Iraq of Yazidis – during which Murad was abducted and enslaved – the majority of Yazidi people remain in IDP camps “in the same tents given to them in 2014.” Having lost her six brothers in the genocide and seen countless fellow Yazidi girls and women kidnapped, bought and sold, and disappeared, Murad said her survival “came with purpose, responsibility and hope.” However, hope “has an expiration date; it requires action to survive.” She said working together is the only way to heal after a genocidal campaign.

Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said the Generation Unlimited initiative aims to ensure that by 2030 every young person is in school or age-appropriate training. She presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Campaign Award to Amika George, a student who founded the #FreePeriods campaign and has built support for the idea of period poverty.

When George accepted the award, she told the audience that girls around the world her age and younger miss up to 20% of their school curriculum each year because they cannot afford menstrual products, and she campaigns to provide the products for free. She urged, “enough with the shame” and euphemisms that belittle menstruation, and cause social isolation and educational lags for girls in poverty.

Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, noted that the average age of the leaders, innovators and activists featured during the ceremony was 24 years old. He welcomed Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, praising her dedication to action for SDG 4 (quality education). Solberg spoke in her capacity as the co-chair of the UN Advocates for the SDGs to stress that “we need business with us” to reach the Goals.

The evening event also featured performances by Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter from the UK who performed against a backdrop of footage of himself and other Goalkeepers as babies and children, and Fatoumata Diawara, a singer-songwriter from Mali who was joined by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.

It also stresses that the window for action to address climate change – an underlying cause of migration – is closing.

Originally published on Project Syndicate, the article notes that the current “take-make-dispose” paradigm has drastically increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rates and must be changed. GHG emissions, they stress, need to be cut drastically if the world is to stay below 2°C of warming above preindustrial levels.

Solheim and Lacy Swing summarize key causes of migration, highlighting that lack of economic opportunities, environmental degradation, and increased mobility triggered by new forms of travel have contributed to “human displacement and unsafe migration on an unprecedented scale.” Climate change, they note, exacerbates already record high migration levels.

Without addressing root causes, the migration problem, which is “already upon us,” will continue to spiral.

Although it recognizes increasing resilience to natural disasters, the article provides examples of where and how climate change is “redrawing the map” of human activity. It highlights water stress and scarcity in North Africa and the Middle East, increasing droughts and heatwaves as driving zero-sum competition for resources that results in increasingly common mass displacements.

The authors flag the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, on which UN Member States reached agreement in July 2018 and which is due to be adopted in December 2018, noting that it offers a framework for action on climate-driven migration. Underscoring the importance of implementing the Compact, Solheim and Lacy Swing note the opportunity presented by an internationally-agreed system for safe and orderly migration, and that achieving migration that upholds peoples’ dignity is inextricably linked to climate action.

Launching the report titled, ‘GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018,’ at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden, the organization highlighted the need for better stewardship of water resources, and its mission to help companies understand their impacts on the environment and local communities.

The GRI 303 standard on water and effluents was first issued in 2016. The 2018 revision helps companies to collect information on water use from withdrawal to consumption and discharge, and to report on associated impacts on people and ecosystems, including at a local level. The revised standard enables investors to assess a company’s overall exposure to water risk, as it addresses the whole supply chain.

GRI will organize two interactive webinars on 19 September to present the revised standard.

GRI is an independent, international organization established in 1997 to help businesses and governments understand and communicate their impact on sustainability issues, including climate change, human rights, governance and social wellbeing. The standards are developed based on contributions from stakeholders, which in this case included the World Resources Institute (WRI), WWF and the Pacific Institute.

The signing follows agreement between the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development and the Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) on the partnership programme. The two agreed to develop the programme at the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, which took place in Malta.

The five-year PEUMP has a holistic, multi-sector approach to marine resources and aims to contribute to the region’s environmental, economic and social development. The programme will focus on four key areas. First, the PEUMP will support sound coastal and ocean governance with a focus on biodiversity protection and sustainable fisheries and marine resource use. Second, the programme will use a rights-based approach to encourage participation of men, women and youth in decision making, and mainstream gender equality and human rights. Third, PEUMP will mainstream climate change and environmental issues. Finally, the programme will strengthen regional, national, sub-national and local capacity to deliver sustainable fisheries management and sound ocean governance through education, training and research.

Health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.

SPC Director General, Colin Tukuitonga stressed that the “health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.” He said the programme aligns with Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ vision of a ‘Blue Pacific’ and will help to ensure that Pacific communities can sustainably manage and conserve their ocean resources. Jean-Louis Ville, Head of Unit for East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific at the European Commission Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development, recognized the essential role of oceans in “ensuring food, livelihoods, biodiversity and climate resilience” but noted that the world’s oceans face increasing threats from unsustainable management practices and the negative effects of climate change.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

Since world leaders signed onto the 17 Global Goals in September 2015, the UN system has been trying to align itself with the new Agenda. This policy brief provides a snapshot of recent developments in the parallel but inter-related reform processes underway within the UN system.



Development System Repositioning

Following on a mandate developed through a series of consultations for what is known as the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR), and resulting proposals from the UN Secretary-General, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution (72/279) aimed at aligning UN development system with the 2030 Agenda through a “repositioning” process.

By the resolution adopted on 31 May 2018, the UNGA sets out decisions, requests and calls related to:

a “new generation” of UN country teams;

“reinvigorating” the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC) system;

revamping the regional approach;

strategic direction, oversight and accountability for system-wide results;

funding the UN development system; and

following up on the repositioning efforts at the global, regional and country levels.

In addition, the UNGA “looks forward to the update by the Secretary-General” on efforts to align the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) with the 2030 Agenda.

On 14 June, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres informed Member States that he was setting up a “lean” transition team that would work for 18 to 24 months, relying heavily on inputs from UN development system entities, including through dedicated working groups and overall steering by the UN Sustainable Development Group. Elaborating on these plans, Guterres announced on 26 June that the transition team will: operate under a “broader reform coordination structure” to ensure coherence with ongoing reforms in the area of UN management and peace and security; work under the oversight of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed; and be headed by Robert Piper, who was leading the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Bureau of External Relations (BERA). On 31 July, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Adviser on Reforms to lead the broader coordination structure, Jens Wandel, currently UNDP Assistant Administrator.

On reinvigorating the RC system, Mohammed presented the preliminary outline of a 24-month implementation plan and launched a series of informal discussions with Member States in July 2018.

According to an update from the UN Secretariat in late August, Guterres’ plan will be issued in mid-September 2018. It is expected to:

specify the transition of staff and operational support;

clarify UNDP’s new role in the UN Country Teams (UNCTs) on a fee-for-service basis;

elaborate on the regional architecture and multi-country offices (MCOs), as well as on new models of physical presence; and

identify risks and contingency measures.

On funding the UN development system, Guterres is expected to soon launch a Funding Dialogue to operationalize the Funding Compact, as mandated in resolution 72/279.

On DESA reform, DESA was expected to report to the UN Secretary-General in the first quarter of 2018 on the outcome of its internal review, after which he intended to update Member States. Information on this process is still to be made public.

However, on 21 June, DESA announced the appointment of members of the UN High-Level Advisory Board (HLAB) on Economic and Social Affairs, which was established following a request from the UN Secretary-General as part of reforms to the UN development system. DESA explained that the HLAB’s establishment is part of efforts to enhance the UN’s support to Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. The Board will aim to help DESA in its work to strengthen the UN’s “thought leadership on sustainable development” as outlined in the December 2017 report containing the Secretary-General’s proposals for UN development system reform.

The 16 members of the HLAB include former heads of state (Mexico, Chile), former ministers (Cabo Verde, Brazil), an expert in public health, and experts in economics. The members are appointed for a two-year term. The Board held its first meeting from 9-10 July 2018.

Peacebuilding Reforms

A second major track of reforms addresses the UN’s peace and security architecture. The Secretary-General proposed creating a Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a Department of Peace Operations in his 2017 report on ‘Restructuring of the United Nations peace and security pillar’ (A/72/525), and this was then taken up by the UNGA’s Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).

On 5 July 2018, at the conclusion of the Committee’s resumed session, governments endorsed the establishment of these two bodies (UNGA resolution https://undocs.org/A/RES/72/262c).

Management Reform

Also via Fifth Committee negotiations concluding in July, the UNGA approved the reorganization of the current Department of Management and Department of Field Support into a new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and Department of Operational Support, as envisioned by Guterres in his management reform proposals. Management reforms comprise the third major reform track launched by the Secretary-General.

According to the Secretariat in presenting its report on this topic, the new management paradigm will increase the delegation of authority, accompanied by a simplification and streamlining of the rules, policies and procedures, and by the development and dissemination of administrative guidance along with training, support, monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

Aligning UN Bodies with 2030 Agenda

On the intergovernmental side, discussions are underway on aligning UN intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda. This process began in 2015 and proceeded gradually, with efforts including a “mapping assessment” for reducing overlap between the UNGA agenda, the agenda of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the 2030 Agenda, and enhancing their synergy and coherence (UNGA 70), and a report containing recommendations for doing so (UNGA 71).

Most recently, intergovernmental consultations took place in the context of UNGA resolution 71/323 on ‘Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly’ of September 2017, in which the Assembly requests the President of UNGA 72 to identify proposals aimed at addressing gaps and duplication in the agenda of the UNGA as they relate to the 2030 Agenda. On 6 June 2018, the co-facilitators appointed by UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Belgium) proposed continuing the consultation process in the UNGA’s 73rd session. They underscored that the process should ensure that intergovernmental bodies adequately cover the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Goals and targets.

ECOSOC Strengthening

ECOSOC, for its part, has undergone multiple waves of reform in the past several years. A “strengthening” process in 2006 resulted in UNGA resolution 61/16, and in 2013, Member States agreed to an additional round of reforms (resolution 68/1). These were up for review, in turn, during the UNGA’s 72nd session (2017-2018).

On 23 July 2018, through a consultation process led by Iceland and Qatar, the UNGA adopted a resolution setting out a restructuring of ECOSOC’s segments and forums. On themes, the resolution mandates the UNGA to adopt one main theme for each year’s session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. For the segments and subsidiary bodies, the themes should focus on a particular aspect of the main theme.

Further on the HLPF, the resolution calls for improvements to the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) on SDG implementation. The ECOSOC Bureau will consider ways of optimizing the time for countries to present their VNRs, in order to improve the exchange of experiences.

Following the HLPF’s ministerial segment, the final day of the ECOSOC High-level Segment will focus on future trends and scenarios related to the ECOSOC main theme, and the long-term impact of current trends on the realization of the SDGs. The outcome of the HLPF and the high-level segment will continue to be a negotiated ministerial declaration.

This text provides the basis for the coming year. After that, ECOSOC arrangements will be reviewed in tandem with periodic reviews of the HLPF.

Coming up Next

Numerous reforms are underway at once, which can overwhelm calendars and attract criticism of “process proliferation.” A few concrete next steps to look out for include:

The Secretary-General to issue a plan for realizing the reinvigorated RC system by mid-September 2018;

The Secretary-General to launch the Funding Dialogue on a Funding Compact for the “repositioned” UN development system;

The Secretary-General to inform the UNGA, in the context of changes to the peace and security pillar, regarding the creation of the Standing Principals’ Group and four stand-alone divisions for Africa, during the main part of the 73rd session; and

The ECOSOC calendar to reflect changes during its 2018-2019 session, including that the July 2019 session of the HLPF is expected to: Feature improved VNR sessions; and Be preceded immediately by the Integration Segment in order to consolidate a range of inputs on promoting “the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development” and bring together key messages on the main theme, along with action-oriented recommendations to feed into the HLPF.

236,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-surveys-e-government-practices-worldwide-for-sdg-achievement/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Surveys E-Government Practices Worldwide for SDG Achievement,"19 July 2018: The tenth edition of the UN E-Government Survey, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), concludes that while e-government began with bringing services online, the future will be about the power of digital government to leverage societal innovation and resilience, and to transform governance to better achieve the SDGs.



The survey is the “only global report” that assesses e-government development status of all UN Member States, according to the authors. It measures e-government effectiveness in the delivery of public services, and aims to enable countries to learn from each other, identify areas of strength and challenges in e-government and shape their policies and strategies in this area.

The 2018 edition of the survey titled, ‘Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies,’ seeks to provide analysis and evidence to “further utilize the potential of e-government” to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The survey examines: the preconditions and the enabling environment for mobilizing e-government to build resilient societies; e-resilience and building the resilience of e-government; global trends in e-government; regional development and country groupings performance; improving cities resilience and sustainability through e-government assessment; and fast-evolving technologies in e-government.

Among its conclusions, the survey notes that since 2014, all 193 UN Member States have been delivering some form of online presence. According to the 2018 E-Government Development Index (EGDI) − a composite index which assesses e-government development at the national level, including the provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human capacity − Denmark, Australia and the Republic of Korea lead the world in providing government services and information through the internet, followed by the UK, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France and Japan. The survey also presents the findings of a pilot study on applying e-governance to local governments in 40 municipalities around the world. It lists as the top cities: Moscow, Russian Federation; Cape Town, South Africa; Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rome, Italy; and Warsaw, Poland. The EGDI is presented bi-annually by DESA.

Per the survey, since 2012, there is a “steady increase” in the number of country websites with information about specific programmes benefiting women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous people, and people living in poverty. The report indicates that a growing number of countries provides targeted online services to vulnerable groups: 86% in the Americas; 79% in Asia; 57% in Africa; and 15% in Oceania. However, despite some development gains and major investments in several countries, e-government and digital divides persist, it says. For instance, 14 countries in the Low EGDI group are African and belong to the least developed countries (LDCs). The survey also finds that insufficient training and accessibility and “e-illiteracy” are the most common barriers to e-government resilience.

The publication stresses that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as an enabler of all phases of disaster risk management, from prevention, reduction, and preparedness to respond and recover, and emphasizes the need to protect critical ICT infrastructure from disaster impacts. In addition, it states that inter-regional and global data sharing and coordination among concerned countries and regions are crucial, considering that some disasters such as floods, cyclones and typhoons, and droughts are transboundary in nature.

The survey was produced by the DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) in collaboration with UN regional commissions, UN agencies, and several international experts, researchers and related organizations. The E-Government Survey was first issued in 2001, and further editions were released in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

The Recovery Units of Degraded Areas and Reduction of Climate Vulnerability (URAD) initiative was established in 2016 with the objective of financing actions to address the main drivers of land degradation in the Caatinga biome. With a minimum mandate of ten years, backed by a commitment of US$100 million dollars mobilized from domestic environmental fines, the project was tasked with reversing negative trends associated with land degradation. To kick-start the first two years of implementation, an additional USD$1 million was provided by Brazil’s Climate Fund, and US$9 million came from the international community.

While it is too early to measure the targeted long-term transformational change, the article points out that what has been achieved so far at the municipal level is contributing to “noticeable attitude and behavior changes in the population.” For example, community-level interventions were initially expected to take nine months but, according to the project, “all initiatives in progress have taken just four months to complete.” This is attributed to the project’s innovative approach, which simultaneously targets environmental, social and economic challenges associated with land degradation.

Communities that were initially suspicious of government projects “are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

Examples of social initiatives that promote all three sustainable development pillars include the use of fuel-efficient stoves to reduce wood consumption and improving sanitation to reduce water and soil pollution. Economic activities promoted by the project include beekeeping and integrated crop-livestock-forest systems. However, the blog notes that this last category is the most challenging because to succeed such interventions “must match the economic potentials of the community, the land and the capacity of the rural producers.”

Citing Valdemar Rodrigues, Director of Sustainable Rural Development of Brazil’s Ministry of Environment, the article adds that while local populations were suspicious of government projects in the past, the results obtained from the implementation of URAD have not only changed this view, but “communities are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

The URAD project is an example of transformative projects promoted by the UNCCD with the aim of contributing to the LDN target. So far, 118 out of the 196 signatories to the Convention have embarked on voluntary national LDN target-setting processes, with some countries proceeding to develop and implement a first set of LDN projects.

Ministers addressed, inter alia, transitions to a low-emissions economy, ocean plastics and developing sustainable energy sources.

The ministerial meeting took place from 19-21 September 2018 in Halifax, Canada.

On 19 September, G7 environment ministers addressed, inter alia: long-term economic transitions to a low-carbon economy; circular economy and resource efficiency; urgent action on climate change, including opportunities to reduce emissions and climate finance; and adaptation and the conservation of nature. The meeting also discussed implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement on climate change, which are expected to be adopted at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. [Chair’s Summary: G7 Environment Ministers’ Meeting]

On 20 September, the G7 Joint Ministerial Session on ‘Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities’ brought together environment and oceans ministers to discuss, inter alia, ways to advance the priorities identified in the ‘Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Coastal Communities.’ More specifically, the meeting discussed: addressing marine plastic pollution through social and technological innovation; supporting sustainable oceans and fisheries by combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; increasing ocean knowledge by expanding global observation efforts as well as sharing scientific data; and supporting innovative solutions and financing to develop clean and resilient energy systems in vulnerable coastal communities.

The meeting also addressed the Ocean Plastics Charter, launched at the G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, in June 2018, where five of the G7 leaders and the EU agreed to the charter. The agreement requires broader international commitment to stop using oceans as open dumps, with more than half of the waste coming from non-G7 Asian countries. Further collaboration on these issues is expected to continue at the global level during the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference that Canada is co-hosting in Nairobi, Kenya, from 26-28 November 2018. [Chairs’ Summary: G7 Joint Ministerial Session on Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities] [G7 Innovation Challenge to Address Marine Plastic Litter] [Ocean Hub Press Release]

During the ministerial, Canada committed to divert at least 75% of plastic waste from government operations by 2030.

The G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council also made a presentation, noting the crosscutting nature of gender equality, the importance of accounting for the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls, and the need to support women’s leadership on climate and oceans issues. [GEAC Recommendations]

In addition, the winners of the Oceans Youth Innovation Challenge and representatives of the Oceans Partnership Summit made presentations. The G7 Ocean Partnership Summit, which convened on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting from 19-20 September, addressed coastal resilience, marine litter and sustainable fisheries, and showcased concrete actions in these areas.

On 21 September, discussions during the G7 energy ministers’ meeting addressed ‘Building the Energy Systems of Tomorrow (BEST),’ focusing on: developing sustainable energy resources; preparing the workforce; promoting interconnected, open, transparent and stable energy markets; and modernizing power systems. In addition, the meeting discussed the transition away from fossil fuels and offshore energy development, gender equality in the energy sector, and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. The meeting agreed on two joint initiatives on advancing collaboration on cybersecurity and modernization of power systems. [Chair’s Summary: G7 Energy Ministers’ Meeting]

During its Presidency, Canada has been promoting strong engagement with domestic and international partners, the private sector, and indigenous peoples and local communities to advance climate action, accelerate clean energy innovation and commercialization, and mobilize action on oceans health and resilience. During the environment, oceans and energy ministerial, Canada committed to, inter alia: investing up to C$11.6 million to combat IUU fishing; diverting at least 75% of plastic waste from government operations by 2030; and providing C$60 million to help small island developing States (SIDS) “build back better” after extreme weather events by, for example, accelerating their transition to cleaner energy systems.

The aquadrone aims to stop plastic pollution at the source, eliminating floating debris before it drifts into the world’s oceans.

Preventing and reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, is the aim of SDG target 14.1. SDG 14 (life below water) focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

The aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

RanMarine Technology modeled the WasteShark after the whale shark, a filter feeder that consumes plankton and small crustaceans by sucking them through its long, flat mouth. The WasteShark has “an enormous mouth” that is designed to skim the water and track down trash, operating based on the same principles as the whale shark. The aquadron is best suited to collect trash in areas known as “waste chokeholds” such as canals, harbors, ponds and rivers.

The WasteShark can swim for up to 16 hours and collect up to 200 liters of trash in one trip. It is capable of sending information back to a central command, including data on pH levels, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and other water quality parameters. The aquadron is steered through a plotted iPad map or manually, using a remote control. According to RanMarine Technology, the aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

240,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-apparition-a-curious-exploration-of-doubt-and-faith,"Fri, 07 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Apparition’: A Curious Exploration of Doubt and Faith,"Has the Virgin Mary really spoken to a young girl in rural France? A French-language film offers an earnest look at how the hierarchy and the faithful respond to a purported visionary.

Xavier Giannoli’s The Apparition joins Jessica Hausner’s 2009 Lourdes and Dietrich Brüggemann’s Stations of the Cross on a short list of 21st-century European films turning a curious eye on devout Catholic piety in an increasingly secular world.

Like Stations of the Cross, The Apparition focuses on a deeply devout young girl, a mystic who may be a victim soul, chosen by God to suffer for the benefit of others. Like Lourdes, the protagonist is a skeptic caught up in a popular Marian phenomenon, wondering if miracles really happen.

Vincent Lindon plays Jacques Mayano, a renowned investigative journalist who receives an unexpected call from the Vatican.

An official at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wants Jacques to take part in a canonical investigation into a purported Marian apparition and the devotion that has grown around the visionary, a young novice named Anna (Galatéa Bellugi).

As practically every important word in that last sentence must be explained to him, Jacques may seem an unusual choice. But he is a man in need of direction — he’s reeling from the loss of his best friend and photographer in a violent incident on assignment in the Middle East — and takes the job.

Lourdes touched on the question of authenticating miracles, but The Apparition focuses on the Church’s investigative process to a greater degree than any film I’ve seen. (The film to which it most begs comparison or contrast might be Agnieszka Holland’s 1999 film The Third Miracle, starring Ed Harris, unseen by me.)

Jacques’ fellow investigators include a genial theologian, Stéphane Mornay (Gérard Dessalles), who makes no secret of his skepticism of the Medjugorje visionaries as well as Anna’s purported visions, and a psychiatrist, Dr. de Villeneuve (Elina Löwensohn), whose function is to assess Anna’s psychological well-being but who clearly wants to believe in Anna’s miracle.

De Villeneuve isn’t the only one. Anna’s spiritual guide and mentor, a Franciscan priest named Father Borrodine (Patrick d’Assumçao), is so devoted to his young charge and her calling that he has gone off the reservation against the local bishop, despite the suspension of his faculties to say Mass.

There’s also an ingratiatingly earnest Catholic media figure named Anton Meyer (Anatole Taubman) whose celebration of Anna is at once exploitative and utterly sincere. And, of course, there are the throngs of pilgrims flocking to glimpse the visionary and the sight of the apparition, and also, of course, to buy religious trinkets: rosaries, crucifixes, statues of Mary, even votive candles with stickers of Anna’s face.

Anna herself appears to have no wish for celebrity. She has a transparent, self-possessed quality that suggests genuineness and candor. Her message from the Blessed Virgin is simple: Mary hears the cries of the world and wants people to learn to give to one another, to help the poor and suffering. She also wants Anna to have a house of prayer built for her Son, presumably at the site of the apparition.

As a novice, Anna works with the sisters making feather bedding to support the convent, and when necessary, she offers simple, sincere words to the crowds who come to see her. After her interview with the investigative team, in a moment witnessed neither by Jacques nor any other human being, she kneels in composed prayer on a restroom floor: a token of the authenticity of her faith.

Later, after a televised interview with Meyer, we see Anna kneeling again in solitary prayer, this time on a chapel floor — but her very different posture suggests a sense of desperate pleading. One of Meyer’s questions for Anna was how she felt about Christians from all over the world coming to see her. At times Anna’s celebrity may feel like a life sentence with no hope of parole.

There are suggestions of something possibly hinky about Anna’s story. One of the most notable is a purported relic of Jesus — a bloodstained shroud that Anna is said to have received directly from the Blessed Virgin.

Stéphane, the theologian, calls this “a total contradiction with the tradition of apparitions,” since, he says, Mary “has always been an image of love, kindness and understanding. She can’t be associated with violence.”

Stéphane’s reasoning is simultaneously understated and wrong. On the one hand, Mary is certainly associated with her Son’s passion and death. (Beyond that, sacred art is full of images of the Blessed Virgin crushing the serpent’s head and even beating up the devil.)

On the other hand, what Stéphane should have said is that Marian apparitions do not traditionally dispense physical relics. St. Juan Diego’s tilma was miraculously marked with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, but the tilma itself was made of Mexican hemp like any number of tilmas worn by Juan Diego’s contemporaries.

Resisting Stéphane’s skepticism, de Villeneuve suggests that the cloth may be “a new symbol.” The theological implications of this suggestion aren’t explored; more glaringly, no one asks just how many bloodstained shrouds of Jesus there can be.

Scientific tests suggest a connection, of a sort, to the Shroud of Turin and the Shroud of Oviedo (or Sudarium), as well as the Holy Tunic of Argenteuil. Those three relics aren’t in competition — the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium are considered complementary relics that covered the same person — but it’s hard to see how Anna’s shroud could be added to the mix.

All of this is greatly complicated by Jacques’ investigation into Anna’s complex back story: the foster families she lived with, a friend named Meriem (Alicia Hava), whom Anna knew from her foster care days, a grisly murder, a man in prison, and more.

These subplots take up too much time for too little payoff. By the time Jacques comes face-to-face with a person who has, in a way, the most crucial story to tell, neither the film nor its protagonist have the time or interest to really explore that story or that character.

The resolution is clever, giving both secular and religious viewers something to hold onto, but unsatisfying in giving short shrift to the final piece of its complicated puzzle.

The story is also, to an extent, about Jacques’s working through his grief and depression from the killing of his friend. The opening shots of a close hotel room with heavy room-darkening curtains drawn against the Middle-Eastern sun suggest the isolation and oppressive narrowness of depression. The final image, a wide outdoor shot with the protagonist standing in an immense Middle-Eastern landscape, conveys liberation and open possibilities.

Along the way, there’s a suggestion that perhaps Mary takes an interest in Jacques’s healing and sends him an enigmatic message of hope. Does the Blessed Mother see, or is she blind? The Apparition answers many questions, but remains agnostic on that one.

Deacon Steven D. Greydanus is the Register’s film critic and creator of Decent Films.

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

“This has been a challenge for us to look at,” said Simpson.

An ad-hoc committee had been formed to see if it would make sense for the counties to become involved with the airport along with the Township of South Glengarry and the City of Cornwall.

The group came together after the city and township received a report in 2017 recommending SDG become an owner of the airport. The report based its recommendation on the benefits the airport could bring to the entire region if it were owned by the city and SDG. The airport is based just north of Summerstown in South Glengarry.

“Essentially we just came to the conclusion that based on the current configuration of the airport and for reasons we talk about in the report, it would be difficult to become involved at this point,” he said.","Article contentThe United Counties of SDG will not be involved in owning the Cornwall Regional Airport.

Article content ALEXANDRIA – A new initiative was launched on Wednesday by Community Living SDG that will match people with intellectual disabilities with willing employers in the community. “The Ministry of Community and Social Services approved an Employment Modernization grant for us here at Community Living,” said Danielle Duranceau, executive director of Community Living Glengarry. “There are three strings to the grant. The first had to do with the transition of people leaving the shelter for a meaningful day in the community. The second string was the one we have focused on for a long-term basis.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Community Living SDG launches new employment initiative Back to video Duranceau said the idea was to form long-term relationships and partnerships with the local community. “We were able to do this with the cooperation of two other organizations, Community Living Stormont and Community Living Dundas,” she said. “We thank you. We have also partnered with GIAG from an employment point of view.”

Article content The last string of the grant was whatever Community Living could come up with and the resources and tools they develop should be shared from a provincial level point of view with other remote rural communities in Ontario. “Throughout the last several months all the agencies have been working closely together developing and promoting the new Employment Connector services of SDG,” said Michelle Alguire, executive director of Community Living Stormont. “Although we are different agencies, we stand united with our belief in employment support. We believe that people with intellectual disabilities have the right to work in their communities and to earn a fair wage for the work they do.” Alguire said they also believed the Employment Connectors support services will engage and recruit new employers. “We are hoping this is what is going to happen,” she said. “They are going to engage and recruit new employers and build on the ones we already have. The service will also focus on explaining the reason why employers will benefit by hiring people with intellectual disabilities.” The Employment Connector services will also focus on on-site job coaching and provide the resources and tools people will need to educate and train the employees to do their job. “We are so excited by what is happening here and (we hope) you will be enthused by what is coming as well,” said Debbie Boardman, executive director of Community Living Dundas. “We are so pleased to be involved in this initiative for people who have intellectual disabilities.”

Boardman thanked a number of people who helped with the Employment Connectors initiative and made sure to thank a special young man. “I would be remiss if I didn’t thank Jeffrey (Faye),” she said. “Jeffrey is a young man who is involved in the video and he works at Foodland in Winchester. Thank you to Jeffrey for giving us the opportunity to share your story.” The video Boardman referred to was a promotional video to explain how employers can benefit by hiring a person with intellectual disabilities. The idea is to share this video across the province to assist agencies in rural areas. “I would like to thank the three executive directors for being very supportive in this endeavour,” said Maurice Dupelle, manager of Community Living Glengarry. It’s huge to brand a new program and promote it and try to implement it in our community.” “I’m anxious to see how it is going to be implemented and rolled out in our communities,” said Alguire.

244,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/major-sdg2-data-initiative-launched/,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Major #SDG2 Data Initiative Launched,"24 September 2018: The largest-ever financial commitment on agricultural data for development was announced at a high-level side event on SDG 2 on zero hunger. Officials from governments, international organizations, and philanthropic organizations discussed aligning country visions and donor commitments to deliver SDG 2 and grow enough food to feed the world. The event served as the launch of the ’50 X 2030′ initiative to make data from farming households widely available and address the needs of the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers.

The event titled, ‘Data to End Hunger,’ took place on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the 73rd UN General Assembly (UNGA) high-level week in New York, US, organized by the governments of Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A performance from The Moth’s Global Community Program showcased the importance of data through storytelling, as three storytellers from Africa shared stories from their childhoods.

The project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia and ten in Latin America, by 2030.

Opening the meeting, Claire Melamed, CEO of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, stressed that the SDG targets and indicators are only as good as the data available to monitor them. Rodger Voorhies of the Gates Foundation announced a US$12 million contribution to the 50 X 2030 Initiative. Still under development, the project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 50 low and lower-middle income countries by 2030, and then make the data, combined with other information sources, widely available. The 50 countries will likely include 30 in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia, and ten in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Key partners on the initiative include the Gates Foundation, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Government of Germany’s Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the World Bank, FAO, the Global Donor Platform for Rural Development, and the governments of Ghana, Sierra Leone and Kenya.

Laura Tuck, World Bank, said the initiative will put the countries in the drivers’ seat, being country-demand driven. She added that where there is demand, the World Bank will help countries bridge funding needs to close the data gap through the International Development Association (IDA).

Jose Graziano da Silva, FAO Director-General, highlighted that there are currently 821 million people hungry in the world, and most countries lack the capacity to monitor the SDGs. Gilbert Houngbo, President of IFAD, underscored the need for disaggregated data to ensure no one is left behind in the efforts to end hunger. He called for making technology accessible and available to small holders to enable credible data. He emphasized that we cannot end hunger, ensure improved food security and nutrition, or demonstrate that agriculture is sustainable unless we can measure accurately what we have achieved.

A video presentation highlighted that there are currently 500 million farmers struggling in the world. The next decade will be essential, it said, as with better data they can find ways to double their yields and defeat hunger.

Following the video, delivering remarks on behalf of the President of Kenya, Peter Munya, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives, Kenya, noted that his country represents an exciting market for data, with mobile penetration having reached 90%, and 70% of the population having access to financial services. Observing that 25% of African start-ups are in Kenya, he emphasized the country’s need for a skilled population, a vibrant technological ecosystem, and a private sector that continues to lead. He further highlighted the need for: new data sources, including Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT); multi-stakeholder collaborations, especially with academia and the private sector; and using data for better decision making and building resilience.

Gyan Baffour, Minister for Planning, Ghana, on behalf of Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said the SDGs have put pressure on countries to immediately pay attention to data. He noted that data is an expensive endeavor, and governments are in the position of choosing between investing in data or in the issues that the people they govern see as priorities. Observing that SDG implementation has come at a time of data revolution, he emphasized that countries need significant support and input to learn how to interpret, manage, and use the data obtained from new sources. He said the 50 X 2030 initiative is a critical opportunity to that end.

Agroforestry is considered a sustainable and efficient land management system combining crops, trees, and sometimes livestock. Titled, ‘Achieving the Global Goals through Agroforestry,’ the report presents evidence of how agroforestry can contribute to implementation of nine out of the 17 SDGs. Agroforestry has the strongest impact potential on poverty reduction (SDG 1) and hunger alleviation (SDG 2), as well as on climate action (SDG 13), and biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management (SDG 15). In addition, the report shows that agroforestry can contribute to other goals by improving gender equality (SDG 5) and health (SDG 3), as well as by increasing access to clean water (SDG 6), sustainable energy solutions (SDG 7), and responsible agricultural production (SDG 12).

The report builds on an extensive literature review of 1,000 scientific publications and other reports about practical agroforestry projects. The authors present environmental, social and economic benefits of agroforestry at the farmer, community and landscape levels. Special attention is paid to the benefits agroforestry brings to food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and biodiversity.

The publication describes the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs, and showcases examples of WIPO’s contributions to the SDGs.



SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) explicitly recognizes the link between economic and social progress and innovation. In the publication’s introduction, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry elaborates on the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs. He states that intellectual property as a policy “exists to create an enabling environment for – and to stimulate investment in – innovation,” and to create a framework for sharing and trading new technologies around the world. He further explains that the “economic imperative at the heart of innovation is fundamental to the process of societal transformation that the SDGs aim to achieve.

A WIPO-led partnership seeks to ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations are not neglected.

The publication titled, ‘WIPO and the Sustainable Development Goals: Innovation Driving Human Progress,’ highlights the role of innovation in achieving the SDGs, including SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action). On SDG 3, the report explains how intellectual property systems support health care innovation by encouraging investment in new drugs and technologies while reassuring companies of a secure return on their investment. To ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations or that affect comparatively few people are not neglected, WIPO leads a public-private partnership (PPP) to tackle neglected tropical diseases, malaria and tuberculosis.

On SDG 4 (quality education), WIPO works with its member States to support equal access to education, such as by implementing treaty-based adjustments to the intellectual property systems, so that books for visually-impaired people can be more easily shared across national borders. The WIPO-led ‘Accessible Books Consortium’ works to harness technologies to produce books for visually impaired people globally. This PPP established international standards for inclusive publishing. and facilitates inter-library loans across borders.

On SDG 13, WIPO highlights its efforts to promote an efficient global market for environmentally friendly technologies, building the international intellectual property system. WIPO GREEN aims to stimulate the uptake of green tech by bringing innovators, investors and potential users together. The network facilitates connections between companies looking to access, commercialize or license a green technology with the innovators who create such a technology.

The publication showcases a new water technology called CloudFisher that provides clean water to communities in arid but foggy coastal or mountainous regions that face water shortages. WIPO GREEN facilitated a connection between the technology’s developer and the company that commercialized it.

In addition to WIPO’s direct impacts on several SDGs, the report argues that the role of innovation in policy setting can assist in achieving SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 8, SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land), among others.

Gates agrees with Pinker’s view that “there is no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.” In other words, if we want to make further headway, we need to analyze how true progress can be made.

This is important, because big problems remain: Climate change looms, 700 million people continue to live in extreme poverty, nearly half of all deaths in children under age five are attributable to undernutrition. Pinker calls for the continuation, or even acceleration, of an enlightened approach to overcome these challenges.

Many of them, of course, are now embedded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, and many investors have started to reference the SDGs in their investment products. Yet as academic and investment professionals who are passionate about using finance to help solve these problems, and as fervent rationalists, we would like to call for more enlightenment in SDG investing.

SDG investing and what most people get wrong about it

SDG investing is a branch on the tree of impact investment, which aims to generate both financial and social or environmental returns. When the SDGs launched in 2015, many impact investors saw them as a handy framework for determining whether or not an investment creates a positive social or environmental impact: Invest in a pharma company? SDG No. 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages—yes, impact investment. Invest in a cereal company? SDG No. 2: End hunger—impact again. Invest in a bank? SDG No. 1: End poverty—check.

With expectations of what impact investment can do to solve global problems already sky-high, with large investors scrambling to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability, and given the appeal and accessibility of the colorful SDG pictograms, one can see how this way of thinking would spread like wildfire. Investors around the world are sticking SDG icons on their marketing materials after conducting only the most cursory analysis of how their investments are contributing to solving problems.

This SDG mapping is, at best, a good starting point, in that it’s making more people “SDG aware.” At its worst, however, it’s giving people the sense that there’s not much to it and that if we keep this up, we will soon achieve the SDGs. To the SDG investment community, we say: Wake up and smell the coffee.

Much of what passes for SDG investing now is investing in companies and organizations that institutional investors were already investing in and that only have a tangential link to solving the problems as defined by the United Nations. Another big slice of the SDG investing pie is made up of investments in companies and activities that are, in fact, addressing one or more of the SDG challenges, but were already doing that before the investment was made. Are these investments facilitating or accelerating the activity? Usually not.

It’s also important to note that often with these activities, financing isn’t the real bottleneck. For example, there’s plenty of money available for clean energy, but the world has not yet made the transition to windfarms and solar panels for other reasons—including the massive scale needed to fully replace coal, oil, and gas as sources of energy.

We don’t begrudge investors their “SDG alignment” and its associated PR exposure, but this kind of SDG investing is not exactly the analytical and rational approach to making progress that Pinker advocates for. The best we can say about all this SDG hyperbole is that hopefully it has made financial markets ready for the heavy lifting that now needs to take place, and that will require the time and energy of the smartest people working in finance. Here’s what we believe they will need to do to shift more capital toward socially beneficial activities.

Enlightened SDG investment

1. Read A/RES/70/1.

This seems like an obvious one, but most people who are passionate about SDG investment have not actually read this UN resolution, which conveys the magnitude of the global challenges ahead of us.

2. Analyze what is already happening.

With some logical thinking, googling, and reading of books like Enlightenment Now, you can learn—SDG by SDG—who has been making progress on these goals over the last two hundred years or so. Across all SDGs and sub-SDGs, there are already hundreds of thousands of people, organizations, and initiatives trying to solve these problems. Entrepreneurs and investors alike need to ask: What problem are we trying to solve? What needs to happen to solve the problem? Who is working to do this?

3. Think financials.

Once you have a good understanding of which initiatives are really addressing the SDGs, you can think money. How are they financed? It’s important to get a sense for how much and—more importantly—what kind of money they require to make progress. The “investment” in impact investment suggests activities that require upfront funding and then generate cash flows over time. Some SDG-related activities will have this, but many more will not. (The financial sector has been in such a rush to embrace the SDGs that many people failed to notice they were not written with investors in mind.) We don’t, for instance, see entrepreneurs and venture capital firms rushing into activities that support SDG No. 5.2—to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.

4. Think investment.

Given the above, it is crucial to determine how investable SDG-related activities are, and this may be the hardest part. Once you’ve found a program that is actually trying to address SDGs, once you know how much money it needs, and once you have determined that the activity will generate cash flow, you can think about what type of investors may be interested. Some wealthy individuals, endowments, and foundations care so much about impact that they don’t mind lower, or even no, return on their investments. But the deepest pockets are with the pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. And though many of them have an interest in SDGs, they are less willing to give up returns and generally avoid riskier investments. This is logical; they are investing other people’s money with a specific purpose: to pay out pensions, to pay out insurance claims, to return savings to savers.

So impact entrepreneurs who want to go after the deep pockets need to ensure that their strategies demonstrably address specific SDGs, and are structured so that they can attract institutional money. Although investors talk much about their commitments to impact, we think it’s safe to say that the latter criterion is by far the most important to them. Also, most SDGs describe problems in emerging economies, are addressed by small-scale programs, and don’t yield much cash flow. Most institutional investors don’t invest in emerging economies (too risky), in small scale projects (too much work to monitor), or in activities that have little or no cash flow (no return).

5. Think enlightened SDG investment.

This is where the “enlightened” part comes in—entrepreneurs and investors need a thoughtful and rational approach to getting institutional investors to put their money in SDG programs that actually solve problems. The field needs more investment vehicles that allow a coalition of parties to contribute. Some investors (such as governments) will give money away, others (such as insurance companies) will be happy with a low return, and still others (such as banks, pension funds) will accept more risk but demand a higher return. Some parties can underwrite the project to minimize or eliminate risks—for example, certain government agencies can provide guarantees or insurance cover, or can take the “first loss” of investments. Investments need to be structured to accommodate these different profiles.

There are good examples of this “blended finance” approach, and opportunity for many more if insurers, asset managers, pension funds, and banks put their best and brightest financial talent on these challenges. Efforts will require a proactive stance that seeks out partnerships with entrepreneurs, policymakers, and development banks. Investors also need be clear about what they want—for example, what kind of regulatory environment, infrastructure, and legal context will allow them to put their money in these investment vehicles.

Unfortunately, many of the people who have the investment expertise to work on these challenges are tied up behind their double screens and Bloomberg terminals, managing multi-billion-dollar mandates, or structuring private equity deals. They don’t have anything related to SDGs in their job descriptions and are unknown, or not accessible to, the people who need their expertise. If the executives and trustees of the world’s large asset owners and asset managers are serious about their commitment to the SDGs, they must tell their ESG and marketing people to hold off on the SDG stickers and the impact measurement programs, and tell their CIOs, portfolio managers, investment analysts, risk managers, and credit officers to spend time working on ways to fund the SDGs—including the 90 percent of them that have no financing today.

6. Measure impact.

Only then should the enlightened SDG investor think about how to measure the SDG impact of their invested dollars. That said, in many cases, true progress may not be attributable to individual companies or projects. So you may not be able to capture exactly what “your” SDG impact is—at least not today. Often we can measure the progress we make as a planet in solving these complex, systemic challenges—as Pinker has done—only many years after the fact, with painstaking scientific research.","SDG investing and what most people get wrong about itSDG investing is a branch on the tree of impact investment, which aims to generate both financial and social or environmental returns.

Accompanying reports on the Task Force’s activities highlight interlinkages among actions directed at addressing climate change-related displacement and achieving the SDGs.

The Task Force was established following a request by the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the UNFCCC to the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM). The Task Force presented its report to the eighth ExCom meeting, which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 18-21 September 2018.

The Task Force report, inter alia: provides the contextual background in which the recommendations were developed; summarizes the technical outputs of the Task Force’s activities; and links to more detailed reports of those activities, which were undertaken in collaboration with other UN agencies and international organizations.

The WIM ExCom set up the Task Force in March 2017 to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change, in accordance with the mandate to the WIM from COP 21. To provide input to the recommendations, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) organized a stakeholder meeting from 14-15 May 2018 in Bogis-Bossey, Switzerland, which brought together Task Force members and those working on the human mobility and climate change nexus. The recommendations will be presented at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, and are directed to the ExCom, UNFCCC and Paris Agreement constituted bodies, Parties, UN agencies, relevant organizations and other stakeholders. They are elaborated in a PDD-produced report, which looks at the evolution of the UN’s response to climate change and disaster displacement, current UN institutional frameworks and mandates for displacement related to climate change, and coordinating integrated approaches to disaster displacement associated with climate change.

While the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs provide several entry points.

The Task Force report also includes summaries of its activities, which are elaborated in longer accompanying reports, produced by the lead agencies/organizations for that specific activity.

For example, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) produced a detailed report on the mapping of existing international and regional guidance and tools, including those related to averting displacement related to climate change, which highlights, inter alia:

The Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI), which delivers capacity development services in risk reduction to support national efforts to achieve the SDGs;

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) SDGs Assessment Tool, which helps assess the contributions of climate action to the SDGs, and compiles information about the impacts of climate action, including displacement and resettlement, to feed into progress reports on nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and SDG implementation; and

The ‘Global Migration Group Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ which includes guidance to producers and users of international migration data and is expected to contribute directly to monitoring SDG implementation.

[Publication: Mapping of Existing International and Regional Guidance and Tools on Averting, Minimizing, Addressing and Facilitating Durable Solutions to Displacement Related to the Adverse Impacts of Climate Change]

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) produced a report titled, ‘Mapping Human Mobility and Climate Change in International Processes, Policies and Legal Frameworks,’ which focuses on, inter alia, migration, displacement and planned relocation, as well as human rights and international labor standards. The report highlights, among other instruments, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which makes the link between climate change, disasters, environmental degradation, migration and achieving the SDGs.

It also suggests that, while the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs provide several entry points related to targets under SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action).

SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses to contribute to the SDGs, including by providing country-level data and SDG investment roadmaps.

The initiative invites investors and companies of all sizes to: 1) adapt and transform their core business strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and 2) to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.

The event titled, ‘How the Private Sector Can Align to the SDGs,’ took place on 25 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, served as the “soft launch” of SDG Impact, and was organized by UNDP and the governments of Turkey and Norway. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses with the clarity, insights, and tools required to support and authenticate their contributions to achieving the SDGs. It will have three offerings, beginning with “impact management,” which encompasses the principles, frameworks, and standards to help investors channel capital toward SDG achievement. UNDP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Impact Management Project (IMP), which is a collaborative effort of over 1000 organizations, housed by Bridges Fund Management, that works with investors on delivering impact through financial investment.

Steiner said UNDP expects to establish SDG impact management standards, working in partnership with IMP and a network including the International Finance Corporation, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative, and the UN Global Compact. The newly developed standards will be the basis for an SDG Impact Seal and Certification programme, he noted.

The second offering of SDG Impact, Steiner said, is “impact intelligence,” to provide investors with insight into local industries, entrepreneurs and projects that advance the SDGs. Finally, “impact facilitation” involves leveraging UNDP’s in-country presence for network development, and matchmaking between investors and enterprises working to achieve the SDGs. This component entails a forum called ‘SDG Impact Investor Convenings’ to build cross-sector connections and identify investment opportunities. An SDG Accelerator initiative of UNDP, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Republic of Turkey is currently in a testing phase, and will launch in Turkey to help enterprises and start-ups align their businesses with the SDGs.

Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, explained that by utilizing the convening power of UNDP, the Accelerator Program aims to catalyze market-based solutions for challenges of displaced people and residents of the least developed countries (LDCs). Upon the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, UNDP is running a feasibility study for the SDG Impact Accelerator. The initial project partners estimate that the design of the Accelerator and its feasibility plan will be completed by the beginning of 2019.

Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary, Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed that “it is a big problem if we educate our youth into unemployment,” thus vocational education is needed to respond to the demands of the labor market. He said Norway has launched a knowledge bank that serves as one-stop shop for expertise, ranging from fisheries and renewable energy to petroleum and taxation, and Norway will focus on investments in vocational training. He added that the lack of relevant skills also presents a major problem for the private sector.

Tilak Marapana, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said his government has started several social impact funds, from private equity to debt, including a US$5 million fund to provide support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). He mentioned that the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Sri Lanka is vibrant with many ideas, but needs access to financing and private sector support. To that end, the government has supported the creation of a binary impact investment network.

Stefano Manservisi, Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), said the Commission currently focuses on EU countries’ meeting their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as “we need to move from billions to trillions, but we need first the billions.” Two other EC priorities that he identified included fostering investing and working with countries to leverage domestic resource mobilization (DRM), especially through taxation. As sectors of particular importance for the Commission, he mentioned agribusiness, energy, creation of MSMEs, cities and digitalization. He called for a mix of ODA, public policies and private investment, he announced that the EC will invest €24 million over the next four years in the Horn of Africa.

The Strategy underscores the UN’s critical role in supporting and accelerating the mobilization of finance and focuses on three objectives to accelerate progress from global to local levels, linked to areas where the Secretary-General’s leadership can galvanize action.Titled, ‘The Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2018-2021),’ the Strategy was released on the occasion of a UN High-level Meeting on the same topic on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. A synopsis was released on 17 September 2018 as part of the webpage for the meeting.

The Strategy’s first objective is to align global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy argues that, when public policies are “firmly and consistently formulated to achieve sustainable development,” such policies can realign incentives and alter market perceptions of risk. At the same time, despite growing private interest in impact and sustainable investing, there are not yet globally agreed definitions of concepts and existing sustainability principles have not led to standards to guide sustainable finance, including sustainability bonds, SDG bonds or green bonds.

To deepen markets for sustainable finance, the UN is framing discussions on definitions, principles, guidelines and standards.

To address these challenges, the UN is working with global policymakers and regulators to increase understanding on the role of public policy in developing a sustainable financial system, including through framing discussions on definitions, principles and guidelines and developing standards to facilitate the deepening of markets for sustainable finance. In addition, private financial institutions are working with the UN to understand the relevance of environmental, social and governance challenges to finance, such as considering how to address sustainably in private enterprise and finance business models.

The Strategy’s second objective aims to enhance sustainable financing strategies and investments at country and regional levels. To achieve this objective, the UN will support the development of sustainable financing strategies at the country and regional levels, including by providing advice and support for creating investible projects, building enabling environments and developing financing strategies. UN country offices and regional teams will also provide capacity building support for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to support countries to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of their tax systems to provide government funding for the SDGs, including by addressing illicit financial flows, base erosion, tax evasion and tax transparency.

The third objective focuses on seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance. The Strategy identifies access to finance as a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable development, noting that the digitalization of finance has facilitated “major progress in financial inclusion” in recent years. Despite this progress, large gaps remain, particularly for women, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and people in the poorest countries. To close these gaps, the UN will bring together policymakers, financial regulators and innovators in the space of digital finance and fintech to exchange experiences and best practices on innovative financial instruments, including on the implication of new financial technologies for regulatory frameworks and the development of global norms.

To execute the Strategy, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives. The roadmap will build on key stakeholders’ current and future activities to mobilize investments and support for financing the 2030 Agenda.

The Deputy Secretary-General will lead the Strategy’s implementation on behalf of the Secretary-General, in coordination with heads of entities within the UN system.

Other active projects in the Blue Economy portfolio include activities to tackle marine pollution and implement large regional fisheries programs in Africa and the Pacific.

The World Bank’s Blue Economy program works to ensure the protection and sustainable use of marine resources.

PROBLUE will focus on four key themes: fisheries and aquaculture management; marine pollution, including plastics and marine litter; sustainable development of ocean sectors, including tourism, offshore renewable energy and maritime transport; and government capacity to manage marine and coastal resources in an integrated way.

To date, donors have contributed approximately US$75 million to PROBLUE. Norway provided the initial pledge to the Fund, with US$15 million as part of a planned multi-year contribution. Canada announced it will contribute US$50 million to PROBLUE. Germany, Sweden, Iceland and the European Commission (EC) have also provided financial contributions. Denmark and France are anticipated to make contributions to the Fund.

253,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/addressing-sdg-5-5-steps-to-promote-gender-equality-in-the-supply-chain,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 5: 5 Steps to Promote Gender Equality in the Supply Chain,"In 2015, the world got one step closer to a better future when 193 countries committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a framework for addressing the global community’s most critical economic, social and environmental challenges. These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Specifically, SDG 5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and should be a critical consideration for global supply chains, as there’s tremendous opportunity to make an impact. Women hold 60 to 90 percent of global supply chain jobs, particularly in the apparel and agricultural sectors, and represent the majority of workers in low-wage jobs in the lower tiers of the value chain. Despite their prevalent role, women lack access to social protection measures, especially maternity protection, and face limited career opportunities.

There are five steps companies in all industries and sizes can take to reap the benefits of gender equality in the supply chain.

1. Increase transparency with better metrics and reporting.

Setting up meaningful and accurate metrics and goals, appropriate to the size and sector of the organization, is key for quality reporting, which in the end means more transparency into sustainable progress. When teams have the right metrics for evaluating where the company and its suppliers stand on gender equality, it’s easier to set targets, measure success and benchmark performance against competition.

Start with the most basic key performance indicators (KPIs), such as gender ratio across various roles and the corresponding level of remuneration. GRI G4 standards provide robust reporting frameworks for gender equality and diversity.

2. Prioritize robust policies and programs.

If policies and programs to tackle gender inequality don’t exist in your supply chain, it is high time to design and implement them. When gender equality is weaved into the management system and this foundation for progress is in place, the next step is to prioritize gender-related programs. For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth. The cosmetics giant has put forward a sustainable sourcing program that specifically addresses the vulnerability of women when it comes to climate change. The cumulative effects of poverty, cultural and social barriers, exacerbated by climate change, put the health, wellbeing and livelihood of women at great risk. L’Oréal is addressing this critical issue through research and regional programs that empower women and help them diversify their income, and by supporting external initiatives such as Women4Climate, designed to create sustainable and inclusive communities.

A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality. One key step is to support female entrepreneurs or companies with a mission to fight gender inequality. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that in 2018 there are 30 percent more male entrepreneurs in the world and that women make up only 40 percent of the new entrepreneurs in the U.S. This makes it even more imperative to support the existing 200 million female business owners worldwide and encourage growth of female entrepreneurship across the globe. A company can send a strong message by selecting suppliers with effective gender-specific policies and programs in place. This is especially relevant for the retail and agricultural sectors, where low-tier workers are predominantly women.

4. Benefit from global expertise.

Demonstrate commitment to global goals and gender parity by partnering with leading organizations and joining key initiatives. As robust as gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs may be, there’s a lot to be gained by formally endorsing worldwide initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and HeForShe’s IMPACT 10x10x10 framework, or joining other national or local initiatives. Participating in well-established initiatives offers the chance to dip into a network of global experts on critical subjects and access best practices and tools that that can break through barriers to gender equality in your own operations and throughout your global supply chain.

5. Educate and train suppliers.

Forced and child labor is firmly on the agenda of most large corporations. However, few acknowledge the vulnerability of girls and women to modern slavery: Females constitute 99 percent of victims in the commercial industry and 58 percent in other sectors. By eliminating forced and child labor in your supply chain, you strongly contribute to achieving SDG 5. Engaging suppliers is key here — selecting only pre-qualified suppliers, continuous monitoring and training of existing suppliers, and engaging them in the conversation about gender parity and your vision of a fair and equal workplace are the most fundamental steps to have in place.

The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues. However, gender is an inalienable component of every other global goal. Educating girls and preventing child marriage helps eliminate global poverty, and full and equal participation of girls and women in global politics will definitely bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which the SDGs support.","These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth.
A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality.
The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues."

The Declaration, which cuts across industries, is dedicated to “harnessing the power of emerging technologies” to reduce carbon emissions.

Companies behind the declaration commit to activate their supply chains, advocate for strengthened political and regulatory mechanisms, and push each other forward as “peers, partners and competitors” with the overarching goal of catalyzing progress on the rapid reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across every sector of society.

The ICT sector can catalyze carbon reduction throughout all sectors of the economy.

The Declaration includes individual commitments made by the 21 signatory companies: Akamai Technologies, Arm, Autodesk, Bloomberg, BT, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lyft, Nokia, Salesforce, Supermicro, Symantec, Tech Mahindra, Uber, Vigilent, VMware, WeWork, Workday and Zoox. Examples include:

Arm adopting science-based targets and aiming to reduce emissions by 50% by 2025;

BT committing to buy 100% renewable electricity by 2020, and cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 87% by 2030;

Salesforce aiming to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2022; and

Vigilant aspiring to cut annual carbon emissions by 50 million metric tons by 2025.

As a means of delivering on these goals, the Declaration’s homepage notes that the Fourth Industrial Revolution provides a unique opportunity to decarbonize, leveraging the power of mobile internet, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Andy Wales, Chief Digital Impact and Sustainability Officer, BT, emphasized that the company and the broader information and communications technology (ICT) sector can “catalyze carbon reduction throughout all sectors of the economy.” Wales noted that BT’s products alone helped their customers reduce carbon emissions by 11.3 million tons.

The Declaration responds to a challenge issued in May 2018 by Christiana Figueres that urges the technology sector to “step up” its actions on climate change. Both the Declaration and its supporting commitments form part of the GCAS official outcomes. The GCAS convened from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, California, US.

This clear correlation between sustainable development and societal stability has long been recognized by scholars and sustainability professionals, yet overlooked by most of the global indicators for sustainable development, such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the United Nations Global Compact.

However, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) attempt to address this issue through SDG 16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” SDG 16 is also considered to be a crucial means to other sustainable development achievements.

There are three dimensions to SDG 16: Strong Institutions, Justice and Peace. Each of these dimensions reinforces one another:

The Strong Institution dimension sets out to establish effective, accountable and transparent institutions, which secure fundamental legal human rights.

The Justice dimension tackles issues of corruption and bribery that would threaten such institutions, and ensures equal access to justice.

The Peace dimension then aims to eliminate all forms of violence against vulnerable groups and promote resolution of any arising conflicts through dialogue, negotiation and diplomacy.

At first glance, the role of the private sector in delivering SDG 16 might seem imperceptible. In practice, however, companies can create profound contributions to SDG 16 through their sustainable procurement programs. One of the industries we see most likely to positively contribute to the achievement of SDG 16 is the Financial Services sector. Here’s why.

Unveiling supply chain risks

The Financial Services sector is not one many would immediately imagine having significant environmental or social risks within its supply chain. Yet, with its global presence now firmly established, its supply chain impact is quite considerable. According to the BSR report, ***Supply Chain Sustainability in the Financial Sector***, IT, employment and professional services are the top spend categories for the Financial Services sector. These spend categories can be translated into two main supply chain risks related to SDG 16: conflict and human rights issues, and institution issues.

Institution Issues

According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion cost developing countries US$1.26 trillion annually. In addition to the economic deficit, corruption is also detrimental to institutional robustness, which is necessary to maintain societal stability. When institutional support is eroded, organized crime, market inefficiency and human rights violations spread. Corruption can take the form of bribery, fraud, insider trading or even value manipulation in transactions and loan collateral. Financial Services companies need to build transparency along the supply chain by conducting risk and impact assessments to identify the weak links that may contribute to corruption and impair the rule of law.

Taking action

All in all, delivering SDG 16 through sustainable procurement in the Financial Services sector is not only relevant, it turns out to be crucial as well. So, where can we start?

Prioritizing spend categories and suppliers

To utilize resources in the most efficient way and aim for optimal improvement on their own impacts, companies should recognize which spend categories and/or suppliers pose the greatest and/or most urgent risks in their supply chain towards the achievement of SDG 16, and focus on those first. Financial Services companies can take advantage of preliminary risk assessments of their supply chain and assign risk ratings to each of the spend categories to prioritize necessary efforts.

Integrating into procurement and supplier selection processes

Implementing sustainability criteria into procurement and supplier selection processes is a grounding and essential step towards supply chain transformation. Financial Services companies that aspire to have their supply chain free of conflict, corruption and human rights violations should embed these principles into service contract clauses and requests for proposals (RFPs). For instance, BNP Paribas has demanded its suppliers to commit to a CSR charter since 2012; and in 2014, integrated criteria regarding child labor into its call for tenders for promotional items. Moreover, the results of CSR assessment of suppliers have been given considerable weight in supplier selection. An additional step forward could take the form of integrating suppliers’ social responsibility performance into the company buyers’ appraisal. This would create more incentives for buyers to look beyond the traditional time and money factors when considering a supplier and help suppliers advance on their corporate social responsibility performances (learn more in this briefing on the intertwining of corruption and human rights, and its rising importance on the corporate risk agenda).

Looking beyond tier-one suppliers

To establish supply chain transparency, Financial Services companies have to be willing to go to great lengths to map their supply chains beyond first-tier suppliers. Putting sustainable procurement programs into practice throughout the supply chain with second and third-tier suppliers can foster accountability in key players involved in the process and create truly impactful momentum to eliminate human rights violations, conflicts and corruption.

Total System Services, with its commitment to ethical sourcing of components and materials that might contain conflict minerals originated in the DRC, has conducted reasonable country-of-origin inquiry (RCOI) supply chain due diligence since 2016. The RCOI process aims to determine critical information such as presence and origin of conflict minerals contained in the products from its suppliers, and in turn achieve transparency in the product supply chain and engage further with suppliers on conflict mineral issues.

Know your customer: Responsible finance expands to business lending and beyond

Besides investing effort in sustainable procurement, positive impact can be made through what Financial Services companies deal with on a daily basis: provision of financial services/products. It is crucial that Financial Services companies understand the potential negative impact their services/products can have, and that a great part of the responsibility to minimize that impact rests on their shoulders.

Financial Services companies can conduct due diligence on potential customers to guarantee that the money flow is not used to undermine fundamental human rights or institutional robustness, and on investment projects to determine the scale of human rights impacts. A report released by Singapore-based Asian Venture Philanthropy Network found that less than 1 percent of funds in Asia leverage ESG investing. According to research from MSCI, companies in the bottom ESG quintile have been twice as likely to suffer a catastrophic loss (over 95 percent cumulative loss) within three years.

The ING Sustainability Improvement Loan, launched in May, aims to reward sustainability performance through the use of sustainability ratings. This exciting new use of sustainability ratings helps business customers who engage in measuring and improving their sustainability to also benefit from better loan rates.

Achieving SDG 16 through a ripple effect

The private sector, particularly Financial Services, has a critical role to play in the achievement of SDG 16. Sustainable procurement is definitely one, if not the most powerful catalyst to push forward the necessary progress. A well-rounded and effective sustainable procurement program is an indispensable tool that will steer the companies in the right direction. By deliberately integrating the achievement of SDG 16 as a priority of their sustainable procurement program, Financial Services companies can set the example and influence other sectors to follow suit, thereby creating a ripple effect to both sectors towards the realization of this challenging Sustainable Development Goal.

The guide highlights that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires using the best data and information available from multiple sources to design, implement and monitor evidence-based policies, and interpreting and sharing data and information “in a way that is logical and makes sense.”

Authored by Luis Gerardo González Morales, UN Statistics Division (UNSD), and Tom Orrell, Founder, DataReady Limited, on behalf of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), the guide defines interoperability as the ability to join up data without losing meaning. It clarifies that data are interoperable when they can be easily re-used and processed in different applications, allowing different information systems to work together.

The guide titled, ‘Data Interoperability: A Practitioner’s Guide to Joining up Data in the Development Sector,’ proposes a roadmap that can be used as an assessment framework by data managers in development organizations and governments to assess the degree to which their systems are interoperable. It brings together examples of good practices from across the development sector, and notes that new sections, examples and guidance will be used to update the guide.

Chapter 1 on data management, governance and interoperability discusses institutional frameworks and interoperability, oversight and accountability models, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks. It stresses the importance of “effectively governed” data, as data need to be controlled with oversight and accountability as they move within and between organizations during its lifecycle. It also notes that data issues need to be considered cross-cutting, in the same way that gender, human rights and partnership issues are considered in the development field, and calls for more cogent management, funding, oversight and coordination.

Chapter 2 on data and metadata models makes specific recommendations to overcome structural obstacles to data interoperability. It also provides guidance and examples for modelling multi-dimensional data in the development sector.

Chapter 3 explores the role of standard classifications and vocabularies in data interoperability, and highlights examples of commonly used classifications and vocabularies in the development sector. It stresses the need to adopt standard vocabularies and classifications early in order to expose data without ambiguities.

Chapter 4 on open data formats and standard interfaces provides an overview of various approaches that exist to make data “discoverable,” and discusses data formats, application programming interfaces and user interfaces to support interoperability. Chapter 5 on linked open data outlines guidance on the dissemination of data and statistics on the web.

The production of the guide was supported by an Advisory Group drawn from the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability membership. The Collaborative is convened by UNSD and GPSDD, and comprises over 90 individuals, ranging from official statistics representatives to local civil society groups.

Excellencies, Distinguished panelists and participants, Ladies and Gentlemen;



With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world’s nations agreed to an ambitious set of commitments and pathways which – if successfully implemented - will lead to fundamental transformations of our economies and societies.



Addressing the SDG investment gap



Estimates on achieving the SDGs vary broadly, but some indicate that will take between US$5 to $7 trillion, with an investment gap in developing countries of about $2.5 trillion. In contrast, global flows of development aid (ODA) reached USD 146.6 billion in 2017.



While traditional types of development financing – including ODA and domestic public resources – will remain critical to achieving the SDGs, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, private and blended capital will also be central.



The good news is there is no shortage of private capital across the world. There is currently about US$256 trillion in private wealth in the global capital markets. Attracting just 1% of this amount would meet the financing gap for the SDGs in developing countries.



Blended finance instruments, where official resources are ‘blended’ with commercial private capital, also show promise. Between 2012-2015, official development finance interventions mobilized USD 81.1 billion from the private sector. At this rate, blended finance is expected to increase to $252 billion by 2030, but this would still fall short of filling the SDG funding gap.



Private sector investment continues to be highly concentrated, mostly in resource-rich countries and extractive industries. At the same time, investments in many developing countries have been curtailed by: 1) the high perception of risk; 2) a lack of investment-ready opportunities; and 3) unpredictable and limiting regulatory frameworks to de-risk and incentivize sustainable investments.



In the words of our UN Secretary-General, “the world has the resources to deliver, but they are not allocated where they are needed most” .



The SDGs have put a spotlight on a market failure or lack of alignment between, on the one hand, those policy objectives we set for ourselves in developmental terms and, on the other hand, the issues the financial system and financial markets are focused on. Our challenge is to recognize that we have to bring two global conversations together.



One conversation is about the international, economic and financial policies and the national space for policy-making that is focused on economic development and growth. And the second is a conversation about securing private and public finance for SDG achievement, including ODA, but also many domestic financial resources that are currently not being deployed in that context.



It is now an imperative to work towards a global strategy that can look at an alignment between the incentives that a financial system has to invest in the SDGs and long-term economic development prospects, including a fair globalization agenda.



Last month, the UNSG launched his strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, laying out actions the UN will take support countries to accelerate financing the SDGs, including: (1) we must align global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda; (2) we need to create and/or strengthen sustainable financing and investment strategies at the regional and country levels; and (3) finally, we must seize the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide inclusive and more equitable access to finance.



The SDGs as an investment opportunity



The SDGs are not only highly relevant for promoting broad-based trust and prosperity but offer an excellent economic investment opportunity for financial markets and economic growth.



Drawing on consultations with governments and companies, UNDP and the Global Reporting Initiative published a report on how business accelerate the achievement of the SDGs . Two complementary trends are clear: (1) businesses are increasingly engaged in impact measurement and sustainability reporting to capture their sustainability impact and (2) there is growing public sector interest in capturing the business contribution to the SDGs.



Indeed, according to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, up to $12 trillion in new economic opportunities could be generated through investments in agriculture, cities, energy and health alone – all critical areas for SDG achievement. This could lead to the creation of 380 million jobs by 2030.



It is here that the critical importance of partnerships, and the role of multilateral institutions – like UNDP – in forging such partnerships, come into play.



The importance of innovative partnerships



We are witnessing a growing change in business models, where innovation and broad-based partnerships often play a key role.



Sustainable and responsible investing, blended finance instruments, green bonds, and corporate venturing – represent a range of investment approaches which are more readily aligned to the SDGs because they already incorporate social and environmental considerations.



Governments can create partnerships with institutions working on climate change, such as the Climate Bonds Initiative, to develop financial products such as green bonds and securities and to develop new market platforms such as crowdfunding and fintech.



The fintech revolution, for instance, is disrupting practices in banking, investment and insurance and offering new ways to democratize and make affordable the participation into the financial system, including to the poor and excluded in remote and rural areas. Frontier technologies open possibilities for financial innovation to mobilize capital towards the SDGs, including risk-assessment and investment returns, such as in the case of Artificial intelligence, blockchain, the internet of things, and cloud computing .



Last year, HSBC launched the first SDG Bond for $1billion, which matures in 2023 and was three times oversubscribed. It will be used to support projects that offer broad social, economic and environmental benefits as aligned to seven selected SDG targets.



Indonesia and Malaysia have been leading with the ‘green sukuk’ – an innovative financing mechanism aimed to protect the environment and tackle climate change. Earlier this year, Indonesia traded $1.25billion in five-year green sukuk that will invest in renewable energy and green infrastructure. Globally, $155.5 billion of green bonds were sold in 2017.



Moving from Billions to Trillions



Impact investment is gradually growing from niche-to-scale in a few years’ time globally: 26% or almost US$23 trillion of investments worldwide were managed under Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards in 2015; and green bonds emissions grew from zero to close to a trillion in a decade.



So, it is truly viable to move from billions to the trillions required to fill the SDG investment gap. Right now, our biggest challenge for scaling up private investments on the SDGs continues to be the lack of harmonization and standardisation.



To move from billions to trillions, greater cooperation is therefore needed to build and sustain the progress attained by putting in place regulations and incentives, to ensure that financing flows towards investments that advance the SDGs prove the “additionality” offered by responsible investment and innovative finance models.



UNDP, in partnership with governments, philanthropy, businesses, investors, communities, civil society and academia, seeks to amplify and accelerate this momentum for market change into transformation.



Few weeks ago, during the UN General Assembly, UNDP launched the SDG Impact Facility which aims to support business to adapt and transform their core strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.



Conclusion



To meet the challenge of addressing the SDG investment gap, our efforts must be accelerated ahead of the 2030 deadline. In so doing, partnerships are of the essence – and not only traditional ones, but also the ones that draw on non-traditional forms of cooperation and co-creation for transformative impact.



We in the UN development System, the IFIs, and other multilateral institutions must use our convening capacities to prepare the ground for the confluence of these conversations between the interests of international financial markets and the need to finance the SDGs.



Our success will represent our collective legacy to the generations of the future.","One conversation is about the international, economic and financial policies and the national space for policy-making that is focused on economic development and growth.

The project seeks to serve as communication and educational tool to engage the global public in the SDGs.



The Good Life Goals is a joint initiative, and the 10-YFP Sustainable Lifestyles and Education programme, co-led by the governments of Sweden and Japan, is represented in the project by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES). Launching the goals at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, Solitaire Townsend, Co-founder of Futerra, remarked that sharing a set of clear Good Life Goals and meaningful actions for each SDG can help build confidence that everyone is important, needed, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

For each SDG, the Good Life Goals propose five actions that people can take to have tangible impact on the SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the project outlines the five following actions to “help end poverty”: i) learn the causes of poverty at home and abroad; ii) share and donate what you can; iii) buy from companies that pay people fairly; iv) save, borrow and invest responsibly; and v) demand decent wages and opportunities for all.

On SDG 13 (climate action), the project suggests to “act on climate” by: i) learning about climate solutions; ii) calling “for more renewable energy in your country;” iii) eating more plants and cutting down on meat; iv) walking and cycling rather than driving; and v) demanding leaders to take bold action “today.” A video on the Good Life Goals provides an overview of the actions that can be taken for each of the SDGs.

A WBCSD press release notes that, from a business perspective, the Good Life Goals can provide companies with valuable insight into the ways the SDGs link to the actions, activities and lifestyles of their customers, and this understanding can help brands more effectively engage with people around the behaviors that are connected to their products and services. WBCSD also remarks that exploring the linkages between people’s day-to-day lives and the SDGs can help businesses identify innovation opportunities capable of offering better and more sustainable lifestyles. Finally, the Good Life Goals can be used by brands, NGOs and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing sustainable development, and can provide companies with a simple tool that they can use to enhance awareness of the SDGs among their own staff and promote a corporate culture that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, WBCSD says.

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

261,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/irena-launches-sids-lighthouses-initiative-2-0/,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IRENA Launches SIDS Lighthouses Initiative 2.0,"28 September 2018: Leaders of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and development partners gathered at UN Headquarters for a High-Level Roundtable to discuss how to increase ambition to accelerate energy transformation in SIDS and to launch the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative 2.0. The initiative intends to strengthen cooperation on renewable energy, accelerate energy transformation in SIDS, strengthen climate resilience, and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.

Initially launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative was created to support SIDS in their process of scaling up renewable energy through partnerships across public institutions, the private sector, and inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations. Through coordination with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Lighthouses Initiative has led to a rapid growth in renewable energy for its members. For example, from 2014 to 2017 more than 250 MW of solar photovoltaic and over 50 MW of wind energy came online as an outcome of the Initiative resulting also in significant cost reductions.

The SIDS Lighthouses Initiative met its 2020 targets for installed capacity in renewable energy and funding three years ahead of schedule.

IRENA Director-General Adnan Amin commended SIDS governments for demonstrating, “tremendous leadership in harnessing their renewable energy potential and their strong political will to act.” In addition, the initial Lighthouses Initiative met its targets for 2020 three years ahead of schedule in terms of installed capacity and mobilizing funding. These are great successes for SIDS as they are more vulnerable to climate change effects when compared to other countries, he underlined.

Participants at the event discussed priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0 with many underlining that investments and access to finance remain a major challenge. Renewables only account for 10% of total installed capacity in SIDS. Participants suggested that taking the energy transformation to the next level with renewable energy at the center would lead to sustainable job creation, fostering economic growth, and ensuring food and water security.

IRENA identified four priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0: supporting SIDS in implementation and review of their nationally determined contributions; expanding the focus to include geothermal energy and energy from the ocean, as well as accelerating renewables in the transport sector; enhancing support for development of bankable projects; and reinforcing work on the nexus between energy, agriculture, food, health, and water.

Hilda Heine, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, discussed the urgent need for action and their accomplishments made possible through the Lighthouses Initiative. Recently, the Marshall Islands has begun a new solar project in their second largest community and are hoping to bring similar projects to life. Currently their other island communities are 100% renewable energy and are seeking support from UAE to help bring three of their major sub-centers to at least 95% renewable energy by 2020. Heine urged that the energy transition process be inclusive taking into account gender and human rights.

Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, spoke on limitations and progress. While three hydroelectricity plants in his country are being improved for efficiency and solar renewables are expanding, the major initiative focuses on geothermal energy. He noted that there is a two-year delay for the goal of 80% geothermal energy, but that his country is actively working with other organizations to meet this goal.

Aruba, the UAE, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) also participated in the Roundtable, speaking on issues ranging from project design, renewable targets, collapsible turbines, financial limitations, grant funding, and batteries.

262,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/closing-the-biodiversity-action-gap/,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Closing the Biodiversity Action Gap,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. The graph below, which contrasts media coverage of Climate Change (CC) with that of Biodiversity (BD) over the past 30 years, lays out at a glance one of the central paradoxes of sustainable development. Climate change has captured the public imagination. There can be few people who are not exposed to the daily stream of messages of fear and of hope; most have a settled opinion about the threat that it represents or tactics for addressing it. Yet biodiversity conservation, representing an equal (and, indeed, closely linked) threat to life on the planet, flies mostly well below the radar. Despite the rapidly developing base of knowledge on the threat that loss of biodiversity represents, despite the stream of reports that track the bleak trends, public debate has flat-lined over the past three decades as the situation continues to accelerate towards the abyss.

Graph Source: Legagneux , P., N. Casajus, K. Cazelles, C. Chevallier, M. Chevrinais, L. Guéry, C. Jacquet, M. Jaffré, M. Naud, F. Noisette, P. Ropars, S. Vissault, P. Archambault, J. Bêty, D. Berteaux, and D. Gravel. 2018. Our House Is Burning: Discrepancy in Climate Change vs. Biodiversity Coverage in the Media as Compared to Scientific Literature . Front. Ecol. Evol. https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175

Some factors help to explain this situation. The impacts of climate change are palpable and widespread – the occurrence of ever more frequent extreme climate events, the shrinking of glaciers, the recurring droughts and heat-waves – all provide evidence that climate patterns are changing. Whether or not a single event can be traced to the changing climate, most people are increasingly inclined to believe that the climate is changing and that the impact of this change is beginning to bite. By contrast, most biodiversity loss is invisible, or detectable only to those specifically looking for it. It is well known in ornithological circles that the first appearance of a new species is big news, whereas the disappearance of the last specimen of a species, even if it was once common, will escape notice for a long time. We know that tropical forests are disappearing, that coral reefs are dying, but what we tend to see out our windows is still much like it was when we were children.

Also, if a significant part of the climate challenge can be addressed through technology – cleaner production, energy efficiency, renewables, electric cars, etc. – there is no such obvious fix to ensure maintenance of ecosystem resilience or the continued availability of ecological services. Though the most technologically optimistic will claim that we can create – or recreate – the species we need through genetic engineering, natural systems are so complex and interconnected that it would be foolish to place one’s faith in technology alone.

Sadly, intergovernmental effort to stem biodiversity loss mirrors the above graph when compared with what has been achieved in the climate negotiations. Since the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted in 1992, endless strategies, action plans, roadmaps, goals and targets have been adopted, but action to deliver on what has been promised has consistently fallen short. We are again approaching a watershed – the end of the period in which the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were to be implemented, and a global summit to map out a strategy for the coming ten years and beyond. While many earnestly hope that this will be a new “Paris moment” when the stakeholder communities came together and a global climate agreement was adopted, it increasingly looks as if this could be wishful thinking. None of the signs of what created the magic formula in Paris in December 2015 appear to be present.

On 20 September 2018, in Paris, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI from its title in French) held a public meeting to consider this dilemma, seeking to identify some of the features that could lead to a serious shift in the political attention towards genuine action for biodiversity conservation. I was invited to present ideas on what it would take to break out of the depressing cycle of hope and disappointment and genuinely begin turning the ship around. My advice was as follows:

Only a genuine and large-scale mobilization of stakeholders will create the conditions under which the more courageous politicians will feel they can take the risk of genuine leadership. The somewhat specialized community backing biodiversity conservation cannot, on its own, generate this mobilization. It is simply too small. The trick is to mobilize a wide range of key stakeholders concerned with the future of nature and natural resources, but not currently connected to conservation action. They are in the technology community, in the finance community, in the social movements, in the universities and in religious groups. They care but so far don’t see how they can connect.

This mobilization must necessarily build around a new narrative for conservation – a narrative that, against the sober background of our present predicament, is up-beat, inspiring, and shows how to connect concern with action. It must build on stories that inspire. The dominant narrative is too dismal – focused on the Sixth Great Extinction, on what we are losing, on how close we are to the precipice. It transmits an aura of hopelessness and drives potential conservation practitioners to denial as much as it does to action. Fear is an engine for mobilization up to a point, but not when every way forward appears to be a dead end.

The overall focus of conservation cannot be nature as an end in itself. It must focus on how a perspective from nature and natural resources can best be contributed to the wider process of rethinking human development and how it might best be advanced. While the setting aside of key landscapes and the protection of attractive species will always be a part of conservation, we will not reverse the rip-tide of biodiversity loss if it is the principal or single argument from the conservation movement.

And, finally, we must systematically scan positive developments in other fields – technology, social mobilization, financial instrument design, behavioural science, etc. – to identify and harness to conservation the best innovations, so that conservation genuinely remains on the cutting edge of innovation and is not left fighting a rear-guard battle against an advancing tide.

None of this is to suggest that we abandon our efforts through mechanisms like the CBD or Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). On the contrary, they are necessary and merit strong support. Instead, it seeks ways to generate the political will that is too often missing in those processes and to give nature a chance of winning for a change.

The report titled, ‘Progress on Transboundary Water Cooperation under the Water Convention,’ is based on self-assessments submitted by 38 of the 40 countries that were Parties at the time of the reporting exercise in 2017.

In her introduction to the report, Olga Algayerova, UNECE Executive Secretary, hailed the report as a major “milestone,” highlighting that it also contributes to understanding the status of action on SDG target 6.5 on integrated water resources management (IWRM) and transboundary cooperation.

Countries that are not Parties to the Convention could use the reporting template to gain insight into what they would need to do to implement the treaty.

The self-reporting exercise was the first of its kind to be undertaken through the UNECE Water Convention, known in full as the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. Using a common template, countries reported on the existence of agreements, joint bodies, strategies and activities for cooperation. The exercise showed that most transboundary waters shared by signatories to the Convention already have agreements and arrangements in place; however, at least 15 transboundary river and lake basins do not have an agreement or arrangement in place for the whole basin, and at least 29 do not have agreements or arrangements covering transboundary aquifers. The report highlights several challenges for Parties to the Convention, including the need to harmonize governance systems, better engage with stakeholders, address climate variability, meet financing needs, and build technical capacity in the countries.

UNECE and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are co-custodians of SDG target 6.5. UNECE suggests that even countries that are not Parties to the Convention could benefit from using the reporting template, as it will give insight into what they would need to do to implement the Convention, and can also help them report progress against SDG indicator 6.5.2 on the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation.

The report was released in the lead-up the eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Water Convention (MOP-8), which takes place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 10-12 October 2018. Parties to the Convention meet every three years.

Originally a European agreement, the Convention opened for global signature in 2016 and now has 41 Parties, with Chad acceding to the Convention in February 2018, and Senegal in September 2018.

Goalkeepers 2018 took place as part of the annual Global Goals Week on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s high-level debate.

Goalkeepers participants gathered on 26 September 2018 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, following an evening ceremony on 25 September to present awards to three young advocates.

The Heads of State of France and Sierra Leone participated in interactive sessions with participants, as did experts in technology, data journalism and humanitarian relief. Performances by artists from around the world highlighted urgent issues, and activists, advocates and community leaders emphasized that “change starts young” and discussed ways to make more progress towards the Global Goals.

France will increase its development aid from US$10 to US$50 billion by 2022, announced President Emmanuel Macron, beginning the day’s programme. He said France’s G7 presidency will focus on inequalities, and that the three root challenges of climate, education and health must be at the core of the Group’s agenda. He called for shifting one-third of global financial assets from “day-to-day business to climate business,” and said France’s development aid will be Paris-compliant. Highlighting the importance of education for young girls in Africa, he emphasized the need for “chosen fertility.” On health, Macron noted that France will organize the 2019 global replenishment for the Global Fund. Finally, he said youth should be able to dream of being an African of the 21st century, rather than a European of the 1980s.

David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s first-ever Chief Innovation Officer, spoke with Julius Maada Bio, President of Sierra Leone, and Bill Gates to address whether poverty is inevitable. Gates shared the findings of the 2018 Goalkeepers Data Report highlighting that while the global population has peaked, its geographical concentration is changing, with more babies being born in the poorest, most difficult circumstances. This means that, at least at the beginning of their lives, they and their families will spend their time seeking out food for survival, therefore unable to invest in education, health or building assets. Gates said the next wave of poverty reduction can come through investments in young innovators and other human capital.

Sengeh said Sierra Leone can be the blueprint for growth through technology and environmental resilience. To realize this, President Bio said the priority is free, quality and competitive education for “the last boy or girl in the village.” He noted the need for technology infrastructure to make this possible. Gates added that innovation can drive progress when it focuses on a big gap.

Stephen Fry, actor and director, and Richard Curtis, director, screenwriter and campaigner, who founded Project Everyone, recounted what made the MDG era “15 of the greatest years in human history:” they showed that “when the world focused on alleviating poverty and suffering, it worked;” and they encouraged a shift from addressing poverty as charity to seeing poverty as political. However, they said, there is no point in going only half way, and the SDGs serve as the MDGs’ sequel. They noted that many countries have taken concrete action to implement the Goals, businesses have identified a US$12 trillion opportunity, and 250,000 charity organizations have aligned themselves with the SDGs. But the momentum of the first few years of the 2030 Agenda can falter “without new energy,” they said, and they called on campaigners to push governments further in 2019. Moreover, in 2020, the world must “work out the big sea changes and the big funding solutions” to support the remaining ten years of SDG implementation.

Steve Waygood, Aviva, highlighted the World Benchmarking Alliance launched on 24 September. He said the WBA will rank the world’s largest 2,000 companies by their impact on the SDGs, in an effort to “reconnect people to their money” and its impacts in the world. Waygood said large-scale change will come not from regulation but from people with money ensuring that their assets are invested with integrity. Curtis added that Aviva aims to become plastic-free, has been carbon neutral since 2004, and invests heavily in renewable energy sources; by changing its own behavior, Aviva has gained the credibility to call on others to change.

Graca Machel urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

As part of a tribute to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel, advocate and member of The Elders, said the lessons of the past show the need to build movements and broad coalitions: transformation is “not going to happen in small groups.” She noted that “there is apartheid” in each of the 17 SDGs. Machel said Nelson Mandela had been “an ordinary young man who simply embraced one cause.” She urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

David Miliband, International Rescue Committee (IRC) President, echoed the reflections on getting “half way there” on extreme poverty. He said that new tools are needed for the second half of that journey, in order to fight poverty in places in conflict. He also said the current humanitarian system is “building future generations of poverty” by not directing enough resources towards education.

A panel of young experts, advocates and community leaders moderated by Melinda Gates highlighted that young people must be enlisted as “true partners” in delivering on the SDGs. Joannie Bewa, a physician in Benin, said young people are not just needy, but bring talent and innovation, and need to be involved in designing and implementing solutions.

Trisha Shetty, founder of SheSays, suggested tapping into leaders’ interest in public opinion, and shared her success in involving comedians in a social media campaign to get finance ministers to drop taxes on sanitary napkins. Shetty also highlighted the complicity of people who remain silent in the face of sexual abuse of young people. Addressing those in older generations who have not faced accountability, she said, “give up your seat. We will leave you behind, because we don’t want to leave others behind.”

Another conversation focused on protecting and supporting girls, featuring Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and child rights activist, and Jaha Dukureh, founder and CEO of Safe Hands for Girls. Satyarthi discussed the need for “child-friendly” education, and said social taboos block the provision of appropriate sex education. Dukureh encouraged the use of technology and media, noting that her Change.org petition to then-president Barack Obama led to an investigation on FGM in the US. Her work also contributed to the banning of FGM in Gambia.

Mona Chalabi, data journalist and illustrator, said she aims to “create joy” while providing data in her work for major newspapers. She stressed that readers should feel something while looking at data, since it can communicate injustice. She also uses her illustrations to disaggregate findings, showing the rates that apply to specific readers rather than broad generalizations.

The Goalkeepers event launched three “accelerators” to direct resources and make progress on specific issues. The 2018 accelerators are focused on: early literacy in Africa and Asia (managed by Room to Read); supporting youth to use data to hold leaders accountable (managed by CIVICUS); and community-based solutions for ending child marriage (managed by Girls Not Brides). Accelerator Stations were situated around the event to enable participants to invest in the initiatives.

Jayathma Wickramanayake, UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, elaborated on the data accelerator, which is called the Goalkeepers Youth Action Fund. She said data provide incentives to achieve the SDGs by clarifying the problems we face, and she said the data that exists must be clear. She encouraged young leaders to apply online for support for initiatives focused on SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The Goalkeepers day also featured performances from: Kenyan rapper King Kaka, who is also a UNICEF Advocate and highlighted his work to bring menstrual hygiene products to poor communities and to destigmatize menstruation; Broadway actor Nicolette Robinson, who sang over film footage of young girls’ weddings and child brides with their babies; and ten-year-old ‘DJ Switch’ from Ghana, making her first appearance outside her country.

UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey urged other countries to designate 30 percent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (MPAs) to address challenges posed by climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Target 11 and SDG target 14.5 aim to protect at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The UK is advocating for increasing this target to 30 percent by 2030. Currently, only seven percent of oceans are formally protected. Further, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), more effective governance and management of these protected areas is critical to ensure that these MPAs are not “paper parks.”

Coffey is expected to encourage other countries to support increased coastal and marine ocean protection during the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) high-level General Debate. The Government of the UK has also announced it will encourage adoption of the 30 percent target at the 14th meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties in November 2018.

Marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.

In a statement in New York, US, UK Environment Secretary, Michael Grove, also emphasized the importance of global action to protect the world’s oceans. He said the UK has already protected marine habitats,“but we must go further.” He called for working together to ensure the health of the world’s oceans for future generations. The UK has classified more than 200,000 square miles of coastal waters as MPAs and has pledged to protect four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim welcomed the UK’s call to enhance global marine protection. He stressed that “marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.” UNEP Patron of Oceans, Lewis Pugh, described the Government of the UK’s action as a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation. He stressed, however, the importance of focusing “not only on the number but the nature of the protection,” explaining that fully protected MPAs are necessary for the ocean to recover. If other countries join the UK and follow through on their commitment, he said, such a decision will be “the most important moment for ocean conservation in history.” [UNEP Press Release] [CBD Aichi Targets] [Lewis Pugh Website on Ocean Protection Press Release] [Climate Action Press Release]","25 September 2018: The Government of the UK has called for protecting 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.

The side event served as the launch of UNEP’s Global Plastics Platform, which will encourage and support commitments to reduce plastic pollution.

Frans Timmermans, European Commission, opened the event held at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018. He said plastic pollution has gained widespread attention, but regulation is still needed. Referring to the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, adopted in early 2018, he said the EU plans to make plastics more circular and to ban them where there are feasible consumer alternatives.

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle urged participants to “rethink the whole problem of single-use, throwaway goods,” as recycling “only marks the start of another problem.”

Erik Solheim, UN Environment Executive Director, said the economic threat of plastic pollution can become an opportunity. He said UN Environment has established a Global Plastics Platform, which will support countries and cities in establishing policies to reduce plastic pollution. UN Environment notes that in 2018, a number of countries announced plans to ban single-use plastics: India said it will ban all single-use plastic by 2022; Botswana, Chile and Peru announced plastic bag bans; Nigeria revealed plans to establish recycling plants across the country; and Brazil announced a national plan on plastics.

In addition to policy support, the Platform will explore ways to change the design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, in line with a transition to a more circular economy. UN Environment reports that such efforts will include identifying opportunities to reduce economic and industrial waste. The Platform will build on and advance the World Economic Forum-hosted Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, the work of the Regional Seas Conventions, and other existing initiatives and partnerships.

UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

Susan Goldberg, National Geographic, moderated a panel with heads of state and ministers from Aruba, Canada, Colombia, Iceland, Norway and Rwanda, as well as business leaders in retail and waste management. Officials from other countries spoke from the floor. Speakers highlighted several commitments, policies and initiatives, including on single-use plastics:

Aruba will ban all single-use plastics by 2020, following its 2016 ban on single-use plastic bags;

Spain will ban plastic bags in 2021;

Rwanda has drafted a law banning single-use plastics, following its 2008 ban on plastic bags;

Norway is considering a ban on single-use plastics in coordination with the EU;

Kenya is working with the East African Community to extend its plastic bag ban to other countries;

Sweden and Costa Rica are working to reduce single-use plastics at the UN and in its missions, including through sustainable procurement practices;

Costa Rica has a national strategy to replace single-use plastics with renewable and combustible alternatives; and

Iceland places a recycling fee on plastic goods.

Canada banned the sale of microbeads in 2018, and Iceland is developing a policy on microplastics. Norway is establishing a producer responsibility scheme for discarded fishing gear. In Iceland, discarded fishing gear can be traced to its owner.

Colombia is implementing a strategy for packaging and packaging waste. The country expects to make use of 30% of its waste by 2030, and is managing waste through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The world’s fourth largest retailer, the Schwarz Group, is developing a strategy to reduce and recycle all of its packaging. Spain is finalizing a circular economy strategy called España Circular 2030, which will include plastic pollution measures.

In addition, Norway launched a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy on 24 September 2018, which will report in 2020. Norway also provided the initial pledge to the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund to support healthy and productive oceans, including by tackling marine pollution.

Almost all speakers underlined the need to engage the public and key stakeholders in order for the policies to succeed. Aruba’s Prime Minister noted that people resisted the 2016 ban on plastic bags, because the government had not worked to raise awareness before the policy change. She said that in preparation for the 2020 ban, officials have involved stakeholders to ensure that “people are begging for the decision.” Norway’s climate and environment minister said the government must involve the fishing industry in order to better control illegal discarding of fishing gear and waste at sea. Canada’s environment minister said that once the public learned about microbeads in everyday products, they agreed that it was a problem.

Suez, a leading waste and water management company, said 93% of plastic products use virgin materials, and encouraged increasing the amount of recycled plastic. France also called for businesses to include recycled plastics in their products, and said France will build on Canada’s work on plastics pollution as the Group of 7 (G7) president. In June 2018, the Ocean Plastics Charter was endorsed at the Canada-hosted G7 Summit by the EU, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

Canada noted that even with Canada being “good at recycling,” the rate is only 11%, so the chemicals industry has a role to play in finding “leapfrog solutions.” The UK noted the launch in partnership with Canada of a PPP, the Global Plastics Action Partnership. She called on companies such as Suez to make it easier to recycle plastic waste.

Sweden said it is spending US$10 million per year until 2020 to cover municipalities’ costs for cleanup, promote innovation to combat microplastic pollution, and reduce discarded fishing gear. Sweden also established a government inquiry on possible measures to “go beyond EU legislation” on marine pollution. She highlighted the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Ad Hoc Open Ended Expert Group to identify options for combating marine litter for consideration by UNEA-4, noting the need for stronger global and regional architecture on the issue. The Union for the Mediterranean said it is working to identify marine litter hotspots in the Mediterranean region.

Turning to the local level, the mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, highlighted the health consequences of uncollected waste. She said Freetown’s approach will include: getting collection systems working, which needs investment; starting a recycling system and encouraging more businesses to join the sector; innovation and competition for clearing waste and fighting plastic; and joining the move to ban single-use plastic.

The Office of UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said the UNGA President will launch a global campaign and call to action to address plastic waste “once and for all.” She observed that the UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

We focus particularly on knowledge offerings relating to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 10 (reduced inequalities).

Technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems, according to WDR 2019.

The World Development Report (WDR) 2019, released during the meetings by the World Bank Group, focuses on “the changing nature of work,” particularly in the face of technological advances and fears that automation will replace employees with machines. The publication asserts that such fears are unfounded, noting that technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems. It considers issues raised by automation and digitization vis-à-vis businesses, and reviews how these impacts can be harnessed to promote social protection and inclusion, describing the idea of a new social contract. A summary blog on the report is also available. The report also presents the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which was formally launched in Bali. A World Bank press release notes that “jobs of the future require more investment in people.”

However, Sophie Edwards reports on Devex that civil society responses to the WDR have been less than positive, due to “a strong deregulatory thrust” and “attacks on many basic work rights” in a world where “technology is pushing down the value of labor in the economy.” Edwards notes that in a side session during the annual meetings, World Bank staff painted an optimistic scenario where new opportunities are created, but flagged that the poorest citizens and informal workers may not be able access those new jobs without increases in social protections from governments.

Also exploring fears of negative impacts on employment, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive Development released a report titled, ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth: From paralysis to preparation.’ The report examines the impact of technological innovation on growth, jobs and livelihoods, recognizing that “technologies are radically transforming peoples’ lives.” It explores whether frontier technologies such as machine learning will indeed benefit the world’s poorest. The Commission finds that estimates of job losses due to automation—which range from 9-80%—are misleading because the methodologies behind them tend to “ignore the upsides of technological progress” that often result in new opportunities. The report identifies five pathways that developing counties can pursue to ensure inclusive growth: 1) raising value from agriculture; 2) new global value chains in manufacturing; 3) global trade in services; 4) linking the informal sector to the formal economy; and 5) diverse, connected domestic economies that reduce costs and increase innovation. Across these pathways, the Commission underscores the need to create “a digital-ready country” that guides markets towards innovation through broad support for entrepreneurs and maximizes inclusiveness by ensuring a level playing field. The Commission is hosted by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.

Shanta Devarajan, Acting Chief Economist of the World Bank, compares the two publications above – ‘The Changing Nature of Work’ and ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth’ – in a post on The Brookings Institution’s blog titled, ‘the future of inclusive growth.’ Devarajan notes that both paint “an optimistic picture of the impact of technology on developing countries” and “provide a robust platform for harnessing the power of technology for inclusive growth.” Each report, he explains, addresses the impacts of technology on inequality, noting that efficiency gains outlined in the Pathways report can benefit poorer segments of society. He writes that farmers, who tend to have comparatively low incomes, could benefit from improved crop yields driven by data analytics and biotechnology. However, he cautions that the WDR articulates a blurring of firms’ boundaries, changing production patterns and employment trajectories.

Turning to SDG 10, Development Finance International (DFI) and Oxfam launched the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2018. The index, which assesses governments by their initiatives to bridge the gap between rich and poor, focuses on efforts in three policy areas: social spending, progressive taxation, and higher wages and stronger labor rights for workers (particularly women). This second edition builds on the 2017’s “beta version,” adding new sub-indicators in the tax and labor categories. Top overall performers include Denmark, Germany and Finland, while laggards are Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Haiti. However, the findings stress that all of the 157 countries it covers “could do more, even those near the top.”

IBON International published a paper, titled, ‘Implementing the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): Reinforcing Corporate Capture of the Global South.’ The piece looks into the implementation of the MFD model in Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, and articulates a need to move beyond this approach. The authors argue that the systematization of private actors in the model poses risks to peoples’ right to participate in development. They cite a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report that finds “differences in private and social returns” of “bankable” projects under the MFD approach, and call for national development strategies to “be owned and led by the people… whose rights to land, social services and to development are at stake.”

On financing poverty eradication more broadly, Development Initiatives launched ‘Investments to End Poverty 2018’ during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The report explores ways of strengthening aid amidst a “rapidly changing development finance landscape,” the mobilization of all resources to leave no one behind, and moving from data to impact through increased transparency. The executive summary emphasizes that business as usual leaves people behind, and that urgent action is needed to change trajectories on meeting aid commitments and identifying the synergies between difference resources. It highlights growing global inequality, lamenting that that the world’s poorest are “falling further and further behind,” that information provision has not kept pace with the need for disaggregated data, and that investments must be made to ensure both wellbeing and economic potential, such as social protection, health and education.

Finally, as noted above, the World Bank launched its Human Capital Index, one pillar of the Human Capital Project, which aims to raise awareness on lack of investments in “human capital,” which encompasses peoples’ skills, health, knowledge, and resilience. Investing in these areas can enable increased productivity, flexibility and innovation, and can act as “a central driver of sustainable growth and poverty reduction,” the authors argue. The Index reviews five indicators on health and education that can be linked to productivity as an adult, in order to arrive at an aggregate score between 0 and 1. As noted by Devex, Singapore tops the list with a score of 0.88. The Human Capital Summit was held on 11 October 2018, in the margins of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

A report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, ‘Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them,’ examines why some emerging economies have grown faster and more consistently than others. The report examines 71 developing economies and identifies two factors that help explain their “outperformance”: a policy agenda that promotes growth, and the role of large companies. Among other findings, the authors highlight changes in the global landscape on demographics, trade patterns and the digital revolution, which they note provide new opportunities in both manufacturing and services.

Signed during the 36th regular meeting of the Agricultural Council of the Southern Cone, which placed food security and crop conservation at the center of discussions, the Ministerial Declaration highlights the need to strengthen the Treaty, in view of its objective regarding conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from their use.

A Working Group has been mandated to address challenges concerning the ability of the ITPGRFA Multilateral System of access and benefit-sharing to generate and share monetary benefits.

“Every nation can and should benefit from the multilateral mechanisms of the International Treaty that facilitate the exchange of seeds and participation in the distribution of benefits,” said ITPGRFA Secretary Kent Nnadozie in his comments. “We welcome this Ministerial Declaration, and hope that it will encourage those Latin American countries that have not yet joined our global community to do so.”

The ITPGRFA is critical for the achievement of several SDG targets, including targets 2.3 on agricultural productivity, 2.4 on sustainable food production systems, 2.5 on genetic diversity of seeds, and 15.6 on fair and equitable benefit-sharing. Its core is the Multilateral System of access and benefit-sharing, which facilitates access to, and exchange of, a specified list of crops considered vital for food security and agricultural research. It also institutionalizes the sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of these resources. This system is currently under review, and a Working Group has been mandated with addressing challenges concerning the ability of the system to generate and share monetary benefits. The Working Group’s next meeting will be held from 10-12 October 2018, at FAO headquarters, in Rome, Italy.

269,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/new-metrics/addressing-sdg4-3-steps-to-a-sustainable-ocean-supply-chain,"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 14: 3 Steps to a Sustainable Ocean Supply Chain,"Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface and are home to 80 percent of life on earth. Fish, which provide 20 percent of daily protein intake to about 3.1 billion people, is among the most widely traded food commodities — at a value of US$145 billion annually.

The demand for fishing poses a key problem. Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013. As a response, aquaculture and fish farming have increased in popularity, but the unmanaged expansion has caused pollution and habitat degradation, leading to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn, contributes to ocean acidification.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), implemented to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), include SDG 14 — Life Below Water, which aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources” of the world.

The challenge today is for corporations to fully embrace the concept that the oceans are an essential resource that need to be carefully managed to support a sustainable future. The question that remains is, how can the global community source fish in such a way that contributes to economic and business growth, without endangering the environment?

Three steps can promote sustainable fishing throughout company supply chains within the guidance of SDG 14:

Step 1: Map the supply chain to identify sources of risks

Operating a supply chain in line with SDG 14 offers businesses many benefits. The Goal aims to preserve the world’s oceans, ensure resources can be exploited sustainably, and fight poverty in the regions where fisheries and aquaculture are most common. Managing the supply chain in this way allows companies to reduce risks, secure resources and increase the positive impact of their activities. A supply chain risk assessment aligned with SDG 14 allows companies to know exactly where to focus efforts, making actions more effective.

SDG 14 identifies the environmental and social aspects affecting oceans, and is an excellent starting point for structuring an action plan. Companies can endorse external initiatives that promote sustainability and the protection of oceans, such as the FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the Global Aquaculture Alliance or the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation.

Protecting the oceans is a task that requires actions in several different areas. For example, promoting environmental best practices for aquaculture and fish farm suppliers is vital to ensure success at an environmental and business level. Research has shown that better environmental performance of farms can improve yield and economic results, which also translates into better living conditions and progress for local communities. If the supply chain relies on catching fish in open waters, then special attention must be paid to reduce the amount of by-catch, minimizing the impact on the natural environment and allowing oceans to maintain their natural balance.

Step 3: Get certified

Finally, making the company’s commitment known is important for all stakeholders, especially for customers. Being certified is one way for companies to show they are taking full responsibility for sustainability. There are different schemes that verify and attest for responsible sourcing, such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Chain of Custody Standard certification or the ASMI Chain of Custody. Companies can also aim at obtaining eco-labels, such as France’s Label Rouge. Obtaining these certifications requires constant auditing, which helps companies ensure that the supply chain is well managed and sustainable, working towards the achievement of SDG 14.

Ocean plastic pollution has become a topic of great concern; it was even the theme of this year’s Earth Day. There is still hope that our ocean will finally get the attention it deserves — but only if companies, governments and citizens begin to act now to protect and improve the health of our seas and coastal areas through sustainable use of marine resources.","Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013.

In the area of science and innovation, the Champions are Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, for innovating in the production of plant-based meat. Accepting the award, the CEOs noted that you don’t need an animal to produce meat, and that, through science, one can mimic nature in a manner that allows consumers to choose their products, rather than attempting to force dietary shifts. The Champion for entrepreneurial vision is Coachin International Airport, which is fully-powered by solar energy, and plans to continue its visionary efforts around green entrepreneurship and resilience, particularly in the face of natural disasters such as flooding in Kerala, India. Zhejiang Province was recognized as a Champion in the area of inspiration and action, for its Green Rural Revival Programme, which ensures that no rural refuse is dumped, among other initiative. Finally, Joan Carling was presented with the lifetime achievement award for her advocacy for indigenous peoples’ and human rights. In her acceptance, Carling recognized the dangers that environmental activists face, and highlighted the disproportionate impacts on mining towns and communities from a recent typhoon in the Philippines.

The campaign quiz features eight questions to analyze users’ attitude towards climate. Questions ask how often users eat meat and about their travel habits and hot water use. Additional questions probe users’ attitudes towards extreme weather events and discussions on climate change. Once users submit their answers, they receive information about how to share their results on social media and encourage others to follow their #climateaction footsteps.

Users can discover their personal carbon footprint through the UN carbon footprint calculator.

The #Climattitude campaign allows users to discover their personal carbon footprint through the UN carbon footprint calculator. The calculator asks users to provide information on the number of people in their household, their country of residence, house size and type, energy consumption, transport and lifestyle, such as preferred household diet, purchase of local products, purchases from environmentally responsible companies and recycling behavior, among other questions. Users can then calculate their footprint and take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on the results from their quiz.

The campaign invites citizens to become climate neutral through the UN’s Voluntary Cancellation Platform, which uses a three-step method of measuring, reducing and offsetting unavoidable GHG emissions. The platform is part of the UNFCCC Climate Neutral Now (CNN) initiative, which supports the Paris Agreement on climate change goal of keeping the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C and as close as possible to 1.5°C.

The Department for International Development (DfID) officially kicked off the Voluntary National Review of the SDGs earlier this week and invited interested parties to contribute directly to the review process.

""People in the UK are doing a lot. We know this,"" the department said on the new website for the Review. ""We would like you to tell us more about it. We are keen to hear about projects at the local level that are helping to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. In the Voluntary National Review, we would like to showcase several examples of the great work being done across the country by different groups.""

As such, businesses and other parties are invited to either fill out a survey on how they are contributing to the SDGs or provide emailed submissions.

The review presents an opportunity for the growing number of companies that have integrated the SDGs into their wider sustainability strategies to showcase their work. According to a recent survey of over 150 sustainability executives from the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) network 71 per cent are either using the SDGs to set internal targets or intend to do so in the near future.

The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 targets, and unlike previous international development goals they are global in their reach, requiring industrialised and developing nations alike to embrace clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and low carbon infrastructure.

As such many of the targets are directly relevant to the UK, and the government is set to detail how its industrial, clean growth, and environment strategies all contribute to the SDGs. Businesses also have a critical role to play in delivering on SDGs that cover everything from clean energy and buildings to industry and transport.

A DFID spokesperson urged businesses to come forward with submissions for the national review.

""The UK is making good progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, with the private sector, NGOs and government all working together to achieve them, but there is still more to be done,"" they said in an emailed statement. ""That is why it is so important that UK businesses use the Voluntary National Review to show how they are using innovation and expertise to help build on the momentum we need to reach the Goals.""

However, the government is also under pressure to provide a more detailed SDG strategy after a report earlier this summer from the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) argued the country was only performing well against a quarter of the SDG targets deemed relevant to the UK.

The report said there were policy gaps or inadequate performance across 57 per cent of the 143 UK-relevant targets, while 15 per cent had 'little to no policy in place' to address them.

Last year the Environmental Audit Committee of MPs similarly accused the government of having 'no strategy or vision' for meeting the SDGs, while a PwC report earlier this year accused multiple governments of paying 'lip service' to the goals.","Businesses, communities, and NGOs across the UK are being urged to submit information on how they are supporting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the UK's first review of progress against the international targets.
The Department for International Development (DfID) officially kicked off the Voluntary National Review of the SDGs earlier this week and invited interested parties to contribute directly to the review process.
We are keen to hear about projects at the local level that are helping to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.
In the Voluntary National Review, we would like to showcase several examples of the great work being done across the country by different groups.""
A DFID spokesperson urged businesses to come forward with submissions for the national review."

The report underscores the “fundamental importance” in understanding the contribution of fungi to biodiversity and its ecological functions.

The first-ever ‘State of the World’s Fungi’ report describes the world’s fungi, and presents positive interactions and insights on fungi, including positive plant-fungal interactions and useful fungi. Fungi, which are closer to animals than plants, provide carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, and can even prevent desertification in drought-prone regions of the world. In addition, fungi support processes that humans rely on for everyday life, from medical applications to cleaning up the environment through bioremediation and synthesis of biofuels. As an illustration, Penicillium plays a role in cheese production, antibiotics and the synthesis of third-generation contraceptive pills. The report estimates that the global market for edible mushrooms is worth US$42 billion annually.

The report shares the findings from a study on the potential of fungi to break down plastic waste. When fungi “eat,” they secrete enzymes and absorb dissolved organic matter back into their cells. In Islamabad, Pakistan, researchers isolated the Aspergillus tubingensis fungus, in a waste site in the soil. They found that fungus was able to biodegrade polyester polyurethane (PU), a plastic, into smaller pieces. PU is used in products like synthetic leather and fridge insulation. This study suggests fungi could be developed into “one of the tools desperately needed to address the growing environmental problem of plastic waste.”

The Aspergillus tubingensis fungus has been found to be able to biodegrade polyester polyurethane into smaller pieces.

In addition, fungi, such as Rhodotorula taiwanensis, are starting to be used to clean up sites contaminated by radioactive waste. Scientists are sequencing its genome to understand how this fungus survives and how it can be developed to clean up soils contaminated by radioactive waste.

The report states that 2,189 new species of fungi were described during 2017. An additional two million species of fungi have not yet been described, a task that the report identifies as of “fundamental importance” to the understanding of biodiversity and its ecological functions. In the report’s introduction, Kew Director of Science, Katherine Willis, emphasizes that fungi “should be viewed on a par with the plant and animal kingdoms,” explaining that the world has just begun to “scratch the surface of knowledge” of this group of organisms.

Fungi also provide benefits to agriculture. The report explains that endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi have the potential to reduce the need for fertilizers and pesticides, increasing the sustainability and environmental impacts of agriculture. Fungi also enhance crops’ nutrient uptake and increase their resilience to environmental stresses. The report underscores the applications of fungi to agriculture as a potentially significant resource for future development.

The report also presents challenges, observing that some species of fungi “can wreak havoc” on ecosystems and crops. For instance, fungal pathogens can devastate wild plant communities and crops, a challenge, the report observes, that is increasing with climate change. Examples include fungi that cause lethal diseases to trees, such as dogwood anthracnose, which affects native dogwoods, beech bark disease and white pine blister rust. The report considers a number of integrated approaches to minimize these threats and reduce the impact of fungal disease and calls for increased attention to understanding the impact of climate change on the fungal kingdom.

More than 100 scientists from 18 countries contributed to the report, which is the part of Kew’s ‘State of the World’s’ series.

12.C.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels.

Progress to date

The breadth and ambition of SDG12, coupled with the relatively immature nature of some of the metrics used to assess levels of sustainable consumption and production, makes analysing progress more difficult than is the case for most of the SDGs.

However, what metrics are available point to a worrying picture. The UN's most recent progress report starts with the blunt assessment: ""Decoupling economic growth from resource use has been challenging.""

The report cites overarching figures for domestic material consumption (DMC) which gives an indication of materials used in production processes within an economy. Globally DMC per unit of GDP rose from 1.29kg to 1.41kg per dollar of GDP between 2000 and 2015, indicating more materials are required to produce a unit of output than was the case at the turn of the century. Total DMC also rose between 2000 and 2010, climbing from 48.7 billion tons to 71.0 billion tons, driven in large part by the rapid expansion of manufacturing-reliant emerging economies. The UN warned these trends will have ""consequences in terms of both resource pressures and associated environmental impacts"".

National governments are taking steps to tackle air, water and soil pollution, enhance resource efficiency, reduce food waste, boost recycling rates, and encourage corporate sustainability reporting. But progress remains extremely varied and even in some countries where recycling infrastructure is well established, such as the UK, efforts to improve recycling rates and reduce food waste have stalled in recent years.

Moreover, many countries are yet to enact any effective production and consumption policies. The UN progress report reveals that as of 2018 71 countries and the EU have formally reported on macro-policies, regulatory, voluntary or economic instruments that support the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In total 109 countries are thought to have or had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. But that still leaves just under half the world's nations with no such policies.

Further evidence of the patchwork nature of global efforts to encourage more sustainable consumption and production are found in the levels of compliance with international environmental agreements.

The Paris Agreement may have been backed by every country (even if the US is now planning to quit the accord) and the Montreal Protocol covering ozone damaging gases has a 100 per cent compliance rate. But the Rotterdam Convention covering the use of hazardous chemicals and pesticides only has a 71 per cent compliance rate, despite being enacted in 2004. Again, the US has refused to ratify the agreement.

Backing for the Basel Convention on the movement of hazardous waste and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is worse still, with 57 per cent and 51 per cent compliance, respectively.

Relatively few governments have moved beyond lip service towards sustainable consumption and production and many are yet to engage with the issue at all at any meaningful level.

""Achieving Goal 12 requires a strong national framework for sustainable consumption and production that is integrated into national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour, together with adherence to international norms on the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes,"" the UN states. The problem is even those countries and businesses with the most advanced environmental governance systems and strategies are struggling to develop truly sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Business implications

The potential implications for businesses of SDG12 are both enormous in their scale and reach, and extremely difficult to track.

Take the overarching goal and its pledge to ""ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"". That implies an end to unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Followed through to its logical extreme, that's a huge commitment. It suggests policies to actively pursue an end to the consumption of a whole raft of products and industries that are to all intents and purposes unsustainable in their current form, alongside the radical reform of unsustainable production techniques that have dominated some sectors for centuries. It raises huge questions about the very nature of consumer-led economies and the long term viability of profits generated from endlessly increased consumption.

It is easy to dismiss the possibility of sustainable consumption policies. After all, progress to date against SDG12 has been limited and there are few, if any, governments that have secured and retained power on a platform of 'consume less'.

But at the same time it would be wrong to reject the possibility out of hand. Savvy businesses are already responding to the trend towards dematerialised products, services, and experiences, beloved of millennial consumers. Meanwhile, the global push to slash the use of plastic straws and curb the market for disposable coffee cups has shown how once it gains traction interest in sustainable consumption can destroy entire markets. Speculation continues to mount over whether or not some martkets have reached 'peak car', as car-sharing and other transport services become mainstream.

At the same time, sustainable production patterns are on the agenda of many governments and businesses, as a growing number of leaders recognise how the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resource security necessitates more circular material flows and efficient production practices. If governments really do implement ambitious 10 year frameworks for delivering sustainable consumption and production then businesses are likely to be impacted at all levels. The achievement of ""sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources"" implies a genuine revolution in resource use and business models globally.

More specifically, SDG12 may at times feel like a holding pen for a raft of targets that could not be fitted in under the other goals, but many of those targets have still have huge direct business implications.

For example, the target to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030 is bracingly specific and suggests much more ambitious food waste policies will have to be enacted that will affect the entire global food industry.

Similarly, the pledge to renew efforts to bring more countries under the auspices of hazardous chemicals conventions and ""substantially"" reduce waste levels and boost recycling rates implies significantly more ambitious waste policies will be introduced in the coming years.

More broadly the promise to encourage more companies to report on their sustainability performance will provide yet more momentum behind the calls for more mandatory reporting rules, while the pledge to boost education around sustainability issues should further increase public interest in corporate responsibility. Promoting more sustainable public procurement practices should create major new markets for green businesses.

Finally, the target to rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies may be a sub-target and may echo largely ignored G20 promises to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but if enacted such a move would represent one of the simplest and most effective measures for curtailing pollution and boosting clean energy investment.

Business risks

The business risks associated with SDG12 are considerable. The continuation of unsustainable consumption and production patterns is, by definition, unsustainable. Inefficient resource flows will make meeting other SDGs covering poverty eradication and climate change, to give just two examples, much harder if not impossible to meet. At the same time investors and business leaders are already concerned about resource insecurity, commodity price volatility, and various industries that could be approaching environmental limits. A failure to accelerate the development of more sustainable consumption and production models will only amplify these concerns.

On the flip side, enacting sustainable consumption and production policies will create losers and winners, with some industries potentially facing an existential crisis. Large parts of industries such as 'fast fashion', plastics and packaging, consumer technology, food, and chemicals are yet to wrestle with products and business models that are based on linear resource flows and arguably damaging levels of highly inefficient consumption.

Some countries are beginning to consider bolder action in these areas, with material taxes, re-use and recycling incentive schemes, and outright bans on certain products all firmly under discussion. Businesses that fail to adapt to this reality will face major pressure on revenues, as well as continued reputational risks.

Chemicals regulations will inevitably tighten over the coming decade, along with public acceptance of products that are perceived to be environmentally damaging - a trend that could lead to major disruption to global supply chains.

A concerted global effort to promote better corporate sustainability strategies and more standardised reporting will create new regulatory and reputational risks, as well as increased pressure, for those businesses that are yet to develop credible sustainability strategies. The trend is also likely to start to extend down the business supply chain to take in small and medium sized enterprises.

Any phase out of fossil fuel subsidies would introduce significant risks for the energy and transport sectors, especially as the cost of clean tech alternatives continues to fall.

Business opportunities

As the UN's progress report makes clear, the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns remains at a fledgling stage. However, there are businesses and governments that are starting to engage with the concept and recognise the commercial and economic opportunities it can offer.

For example, a growing number of progressive businesses, especially in the retail and technology space, are pioneering new service-based or circular economy-style products, extending product life, encouraging re-use, and ensuring recycling occurs. From car sharing and leasing models to repairable and upgradable gadgets or clothes that are designed for years, not months, some businesses are opening up new revenue streams through more sustainable consumption models.

At the same time, many businesses are starting to recognise that higher levels of resource efficiency may require investment in improved design and better materials, but they can also deliver lower costs and improved resource security in the long run. Again, whole new industries are opening up for businesses that can deliver more efficient and durable materials or ensure materials are reused at the end of their original life.

Similarly, efforts to tackle food waste promise massive cost and greenhouse gas emissions savings and as such a new international business-led coalition has already been launched to advance best practices around the world under the banner Champions 12.3.

Similarly, the pledge to advance sustainable tourism strategies can only benefit an industry that is set to face significant environmental and policy challenges in the coming decades.

More generally, research has repeatedly shown that the adoption of effective corporate sustainability strategies and reporting can often lead to improved financial performance, reputational gains, better productivity, and lower risk profiles for investors. For those businesses already embracing such strategies the creation of a more level playing field where rivals are also required to disclose their sustainability performance can only help both them and their investors.

More public awareness amongst citizens of sustainable development and ""lifestyles in harmony with nature"" can only help drive the growth of green business and clean tech markets. Meanwhile, improved chemicals and hazardous waste regulations will serve to reduce environmental risks for all businesses. Any rebalancing of global energy markets caused by the removal of fossil fuel subsidies would boost clean energy markets and mobilise increased investment in energy efficiency.

In summary, sustainable consumption and production patterns can create massive new opportunities for businesses, but many of them will have to embrace new technologies and fundamentally change their business models to exploit them.","12.2.2 Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP.

281,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-first-man-ryan-gosling-and-damien-chazelle-shoot-for-the-moon,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘First Man’: Ryan Gosling and Damien Chazelle Shoot for the Moon,"The La La Land filmmakers reunite to explore the private life of Neil Armstrong and the triumphs and tragedies of the space race.

Editor's Note: This review was originally posted on Oct. 10, 2018.

No matter what, somebody was going to go down in the history books as the first man to set foot on the moon. If it hadn’t been Neil Armstrong, it might have been Jim Lovell; if it hadn’t been an American, it would have been a Russian.

First Man makes the case that the man who actually went down in the history books was a man, if not the man, who cared more about the endeavor for its own sake than about who would go down in the history books.

But it also suggests that, no matter who wound up taking that first step on an alien world, that giant leap for mankind would also be one small step for a man no bigger on the inside than any of us.

Armstrong certainly had the right stuff, including the ability to stay cool in the face of an unfolding crisis that could have fatal consequences in seconds and figure out the right thing to do.

In one way that first footstep in the dust on the lunar surface represents all of humanity, and the U.S. flag planted by Armstrong (seen in a number of shots, belying the controversy over the omission of its actual planting) represents the nation that won this climatic chapter in the space race.

But it was not a paradigm or archetype who took that step or planted that flag. It was a fallible, wounded individual with personal baggage he couldn’t leave behind, even on a trip to the moon.

First Man is Damien Chazelle’s third film in a row about special individuals whose quest to achieve great things is linked to emotional isolation from others.

Chazelle won the Best Director Academy Award in 2017 for La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as creative souls and lovers who ultimately achieve their dreams only after breaking up. His prior film, Whiplash, was about a young drummer who breaks up with his girlfriend in order to focus on his passion and an abusive teacher, played by J.K. Simmons (who won the supporting actor Oscar for the role), who terrorizes his students in order to push the truly talented to greatness.

In this telling of the life of Neil Armstrong, which reunites Chazelle with Gosling in the lead role, the filmmaker has an iconic American incarnation of his favorite theme.

Following James R. Hansen’s official biography First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, on which it is based, Chazelle’s film finds a key turning point in Armstrong’s life in the devastating loss of his 2-year-old daughter, Karen, to an inoperable brain tumor.

The loss of a child can have an alienating effect on a husband and wife who process trauma and grief differently. Following a theory about presidents who lost children, Hansen suggests that Karen’s death may have helped to spur Armstrong to dedicate himself to an arena far from home and hearth.

For Chazelle, Armstrong’s quest may be for transcendence, or at least transformation. A harrowing opening sequence begins in medias res with Armstrong piloting an X-15 so close to the edge of space that he has trouble returning to Earth.

Still, he recalls that experience with wonder, even reverence, when being interviewed for the astronaut program and asked about the value of making the journey to the moon. On Earth, he says, the atmosphere that surrounds us seems vast, but from the edge of space, the Earth’s blanket of air seems thin and insubstantial.

From this perspective, the point of going to the moon is not what we learn about the moon, but what we learn about our place in the universe.

As an actor, Gosling has charisma to burn — a quality he has to submerge to play the reserved, understated Armstrong. Yet unlike his muted last role, playing a docile replicant in Blade Runner 2049, here Gosling bristles with intelligence and purpose, not to mention an occasional glint of humor.

His Armstrong isn’t one to suffer fools or to give people what they want. How did it feel to be selected to command the Apollo 11 mission? “I was pleased,” Armstrong tells the press, and rewording the question elicits no more quotation-working response.

Fortunately for the press, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (Corey Stoll) is more than willing to play to the cameras. Aldrin comes off as a bit of a brute; after one callous remark, he adds defensively, “I’m just saying what you’re thinking.” Armstrong’s laconic retort: “Well, maybe you shouldn’t!”

Claire Foy (The Crown) is well-matched with Gosling as Armstrong’s wife, Janet, who married him in the hope of finding stability and remains supportive of him to the end, but can stand up to him — or his NASA superiors — when necessary. The emotional connection between them is potent even when it is strained.

First Man effectively evokes the urgency of the space race, from the demoralizing frustration at every new milestone the Soviets reached before the United States to the thrill of victory when the U.S. crossed a line first.

We also feel acutely the vulnerability of the astronauts strapping themselves into claustrophobically confined spaces of immensely powerful engines that could easily kill them, and do kill some.

Janet’s angry remark about NASA being “a bunch of boys making models out of balsa wood” rings true because we see — and feel — how treacherous the technology can be.

Following one particularly devastating loss, Armstrong doggedly tells Bob Gilruth, the first director of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center, “We’ve got to fail down here so we don’t fail up there.” At what cost? Gilruth asks. “It’s a little bit late for that question, isn’t it, sir?” is Armstrong’s angry reply.

The possibility of failure looms so large that we see the White House has prepared a statement for the public in the event that the Apollo 11 crew don’t make the return trip. The air of foreboding Chazelle creates at the start of the mission almost makes us feel we’re watching the astronauts go to their deaths.

Not all of Chazelle’s choices work so well. Just as he undermined the big musical sequences in La La Land with his insistence on shooting them in showy single takes, here he relies so much on shaky handheld camerawork and extreme close-ups, even in ordinary quiet moments, that it becomes tiresome.

Yet the climactic sequence on the moon is heart-stopping in its stillness and austere splendor, elevating the film from excellence to near greatness. I’m not sure the words “magnificent desolation” have ever been more evocatively put to film than here. Everything else seems to recede — for a time.

That includes, for me, the flag-planting kerfuffle. There is a crucial moment on the moon, the culmination of one of the film’s central themes, that would arguably have been undermined by a flag-planting scene. Aldrin, in that news conference, jokes about his wife slipping him jewelry that she hopes he will bring to the moon and leave there. “What man wouldn’t want to give his wife bragging rights?” he asks rhetorically. When it comes to the point, though, more than bragging rights are in play.

First Man is ultimately more about the “man” than the “first.” It’s the story of a dedicated engineer and a gifted pilot who knew and accepted that his commitment to the program and the goal might cost him his life. Above all, though, it’s the story of a fragile human being who was never the same after a defining tragedy — who loved his daughter to the moon and back.

284,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-establishes-17-academic-impact-hubs-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Establishes 17 Academic Impact Hubs for SDGs,"24 October 2018: The UN has identified 17 universities around the world that will serve as ‘Academic Impact’ Hubs for each of the 17 SDGs. Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

The report focuses on Goals 2 (zero hunger), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land).

The report was produced in response to a request from the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), and discussed at the 33rd Session of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts held from 30 October to 2 November 2018, in Tunis, Tunisia.

The report highlights efforts in the four countries to date, noting that Mauritania has included the SDGs in its Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Shared Prosperity (SCAPP) for the period 2016-2030. In Tunisia, a press release notes, a “rapid, integrated evaluation” conducted by the government of its five-year development plan (2016-2020) shows alignment with the SDGs. Overall, however, the publication emphasizes that the process of national ownership and mainstreaming varies by country, and is “still too slow.”

The report identifies Maghreb countries’ needs around:

Accelerating implementation and integration of the SDGs into planning frameworks;

Finalizing mechanisms to coordinate national efforts to implement the SDGs, as well as stakeholder efforts; and

Strengthening the coordination of national and regional statistical systems to improve data availability and coherence, which remains “a considerable challenge for all countries.”

Looking forward, the report recommends that additional efforts be made to align national priorities with the SDGs, increase cross-sectoral partnerships across stakeholder groups, and take the SDGs into account in national budgeting processes. It adds that although regional priorities are reasonably well defined for implementing the 2030 Agenda, few strategic frameworks are available to steer action by Maghreb countries, and target figures at the Maghreb level are lacking. The authors call on the AMU to direct efforts towards: capacity building and knowledge sharing efforts, a Maghreb-wide sustainable development strategy; and implementation of sub-regional programs that support African Union-sponsored initiatives.

At the request of member countries, UNECA’s Office for North Africa will follow up on the report with the production of a regional profile that examines SDG implementation, progress and challenges for the entirety of the sub-region.

The report establishes a baseline for governments and policymakers to monitor and accelerate progress towards gender equality commitments in the SDGs.

In June 2016, the ADB and UN Women signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen their cooperation and partnership to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific. The baseline report reflects the high-level commitment of both organizations to support regional cooperation and national efforts to accelerate progress towards gender equality and gender-responsive SDG implementation.

The publication titled, ‘Gender Equality and the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: Baseline and pathways for transformative change by 2030,’ argues that gender equality should be addressed both in its own right and as a catalyst of progress across all the SDGs. According to the report, inequalities for women and girls “remain stark” across the region on a broad range of indicators: the region has high levels of violence against women and harmful practices; women have poor access to quality sexual and reproductive health services; there are low levels of women in decision-making; a disproportionate share of women engage in vulnerable work; and women bear an unequal share of unpaid care work.

The report focuses on four policy areas, which the authors say highlight the potential of gender equality to catalyze change across the SDGs. On realizing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), the report emphasizes the synergies and interlinkages between realizing these rights and achieving other SDGs. As an illustration, fewer unplanned pregnancies, greater family savings and productivity could improve household living standards (SDG 1), nutrition (SDG 2), maternal and child health (SGD 3), and school attendance (SDG 4), all of which could potentially catalyze greater benefits for communities and the economy.

On recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid care and domestic work, the report highlights how redistributing women’s disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work can unleash their economic potential and enhance other development outcomes, including increased time for women to participate in education (SDG 4), politics and leadership (SDG 5), engage in decent work and economic opportunities (SDG 8) and engage in self-care and leisure activities. Unpaid care and domestic work are a significant challenge for women in Asia-Pacific, according to the report, which finds that over 20% of women in the region identify work-family balance as a key challenge to participation in the labor force. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, 83% and 73% of women say responsibility for domestic work is the primary reason they do not engage in paid work. The report also highlights how demographic changes, such as people living longer, increases the demand for care, underscoring the importance of investing in accessible, affordable and quality services for child, disability and elderly care.

On eliminating violence against women and girls, the authors explain that addressing this would increase women’s income (SDG 1), opportunities to complete education (SDG 4) and participation in paid employment (SDG 8). Some of the highest rates of violence globally are in the Pacific, according to the report, which recommends tackling entrenched attitudes and social norms around gender roles.

On the fourth policy area, empowering women to build climate resilience and reduce disaster risks, the report states that women’s mortality rates in major disasters in the region are much higher than men’s, citing examples from Indonesia and the Solomon Islands. The report finds that women and girls are especially dependent on climate-sensitive natural resources for their livelihoods (SDG 1), are over-represented among food-insecure populations (SDG 2), have less capacity to cope with the adverse climate impacts on water quality and availability (SDG 6) and on coastal and marine resources (SDG 14), including as a result of their lack of access and control over land and other productive resources (SDG 5). Despite these disadvantages, the report emphasizes that women can be important agents of change and play a key role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The report recommends: more robust data and evidence for better planning, monitoring and implementation of climate action; empowerment of women as key actors in tackling climate change, such as through involvement in sustainable land and ecosystem management and development of early warning systems; and integration of gender perspectives into climate finance.

The report also outlines the data availability for gender-related SDG indicators used in the report, noting that that only 26% are available for more than two-thirds of the countries or territories in Asia-Pacific, and 41% of indicators have no relevant regional data. Further, only three of the 14 official indicators for SDG 5 (gender equality) are classified as ‘Tier 1,’ meaning that data is regularly produced by countries with regional methodologies, and regional data is only available for one of these indicators. The report concludes that “significant investment is needed to monitor gender equality in the SDGs.” The authors call for “heightened urgency” to improve production and use of gender statistics to ensure “evidence-based SDG localization.”

The report concludes with key recommendations to advance a gender-responsive approach to SDG monitoring and implementation, such as: removing discrimination from legal frameworks and promoting change in social norms; promoting gender-responsive institutions and localization to mainstream and prioritize gender equality across all policy sectors; ensuring women’s active and equal participation, representation and leadership at all levels; and increasing financing and investment, including by making gender a priority in domestic resource mobilization.

The projections aim to inform and assess policies that promote a circular economy, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría notes on page 2. The report categorizes materials as biomass resources, fossil fuels, metals and non-metallic minerals. The largest demand increases, it finds, will be in minerals and metals, including construction materials. An OECD press release notes that non-metallic minerals such as sand and gravel currently account for more than half of the total materials consumed today by gigatonnage.

Absolute decoupling of materials use and environmental degradation from GDP growth, as targeted in SDG 8.4, shows only limited progress.

Analyzing the drivers of growth and demand, the report considers both primary and secondary materials. It acknowledges the growing importance and role of the recycling sector, but expects the sector to remain a significantly smaller industry than mining for primary materials. The report finds that population and per capita income growth will be the key drivers of increased materials use, although technology holds promise to “partially dampen” the increase.

Environmental and social impacts from primary material extraction – particularly around metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, zinc and manganese – include air and water pollution, climate change, energy demand, human health and toxicity of water and land. While copper and nickel have the largest environmental impact per unit, the larger volumes of iron, steel and concrete produced lead to these three materials having the most significant absolute impact.

On linkages to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the preview report notes that the economic and environmental variables modeled “have a mixed effect” on achieving the SDGs and associated targets. For example, targets on doubling agricultural productivity under SDG 2 (zero hunger) can be reached without new policies. However, absolute decoupling of materials use and environmental degradation from gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as targeted in SDG 8.4, shows only limited progress and a need for more ambitious policies. The impacts span the breadth of the SDGs, with particular significance for climate change (SDG 13), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and life on land (SDG 15).

The document was presented at the World Circular Economy Forum, held from 22-24 October 2018 in Yokohama, Japan. The full report will be launched on 27 November 2018. It is accompanied by a data visualization tool.

The knowledge pieces focus on data and indicators to monitor and measure SDG progress, partnerships to accelerate implementation, and linkages to the business world, where corporate metrics can offer additional insights.

Investing in data is relatively inexpensive, argues a series of case studies launched by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD). The case studies were developed by the GPSDD and SDSN’s Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistics (TReNDS) to explore improvements in data and their return on investment. A blog on financing the data revolution by Jenna Slotin, GPSDD, and Jessica Espey, Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), points out that in addition to its low cost, “investing in data systems, capacities, technologies and processes” can stimulate long-term cost efficiencies alongside sustained social impacts and development outcomes.

The six case studies currently available cover:

A blog by SDSN’s Jay Neuner summarizes the case studies launched to date and previews upcoming releases.

Focusing on three cities in the US, SDSN also launched a working paper that examines efforts to localize the 2030 Agenda. The paper titled, ‘The USA Sustainable Cities Initiative: Lessons for City-Level SDG Action,’ synthesizes lessons learned in the pilot cities of New York, San José and Baltimore, through their experiences in integrating the SDGs with strategy development, partnerships and data. The paper offers step-by-step guidance for other cities developing their own strategies, particularly in the face of constrained public resources, and an ‘SDG Mapping Worksheet’ to help cities apply the lessons.

At the country level, a Devex Q&A with Marjo Bruun, Director-General of Statistics Finland, outlines how time use survey data can tackle inequality, with a focus on gender. Bruun notes that such surveys can fill gaps around employment statistics by enabling more accurate measurement of the amount and duration of paid employment, while also giving information on volunteer and informal work. She emphasizes that in developing country contexts, donors and data users need to be involved from the start in order for time use surveys to affect policymaking, and flags the need to raise finance from several sources, given the associated cost of collecting data from such surveys.

On indicators, the Global Partnership for Education highlights new ways of measuring progress towards SDG 4 (quality education), following a meeting of the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) convened by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics (UIS). The post recognizes UNESCO’s role as the lead agency in developing indicators, methodologies and statistical approaches towards monitoring SDG 4, offers a primer on the GAML’s work, and summarizes key discussion points from the GAML meeting. The blog also reviews the status of specific indicators under Goal 4, and identifies lingering questions on data gaps, the consolidation of datasets and the development of simple monitoring tools that can be used in a decentralized manner to capture learning outcomes.

On the overall SDG indicator framework, the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden. The meeting reviewed: tier reclassification of 15 indicators; data flows, disaggregation and global data reporting; and the use of proxy indicators for indicators currently classified as Tier III (lacking a methodology or data). The latest tier classification is available here.

Barbara Adams and Karen Judd authored a discussion piece on Global Policy Watch that acknowledges progress made by the IAEG-SDGs, but notes a growing need to integrate new sources of data into official statistics. They lament that at least 40 indicators are still “stuck in Tier III.” The paper highlights the potential of competition for scarce resources among data providers and others in the statistics community, and emphasizes “with concern” that the outsourcing or privatization of statistics can detract from National Statistical Organizations’ (NSOs) authority or ability to manage official statistics.

Further exploring the use of unofficial statistics to track SDG indicators, a guest working paper on Global Policy Watch by experts from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) elaborates on a proposal to incorporate unofficial statistics and outlines the context against which a mechanism is needed “to certify unofficial statistical indicators as official.” Authors Steve MacFeely and Bojan Nastav—self-described “staunch defenders of the need for impartial, independent official statistics”—explore such a need “somewhat reluctantly” and with hesitancy, in light of the risk that incorporating unofficial statistics into the SDG indicators framework could reduce funding to NSOs.

The paper acknowledges that unofficial data already serve as inputs to official statistics, but distinguishes between “data” and “statistics,” noting that the two terms are often—incorrectly—used interchangeably. Data, the authors clarify, are “basic elements or single pieces of information” whereas statistics “are numerical data that have been organized through mathematical operations.” The paper notes that, in “the post-truth era” and increasingly fragmented world of data, a risk management strategy is needed to maintain quality control and sound methodologies in the compilation of official statistics while avoiding delays, duplication and excessive expenditures. It proposes an agreed recognized body, mandated by the UN Statistical Commission, to review unofficial statistics to determine whether they are ‘fit for purpose’ to populate the global indicator framework.

Seychelles announced the bond at the fifth edition of the Our Ocean Conference.

According to the World Bank, a blue bond is an innovative financial instrument used to finance ocean and marine-based projects that have positive economic, environmental and climate benefits. The blue bond concept is inspired by the green bond concept. Examples of eligible activities include fisheries management plans, stock rebuilding, improved value chains, aquaculture development and promotion of sustainable practices and education awareness programmes.

The World Bank assisted Seychelles in developing the blue bond and in reaching out to Calvert Impact Capital, Nuveen and Prudential Financial, Inc. The Blue Grants Fund and Blue Investment Fund, managed by the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS) and Seychelles’ Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT), will provide grants and loans. The Seychelles blue bond is guaranteed by a US$5 million guarantee from the World Bank and a US$5 million concessional loan from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) that will partially cover interest payments for the bond.

The bond will assist Seychelles in safeguarding our oceans while we sustainably develop our blue economy.

Proceeds from the bond will support expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) to 30 percent of the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), improved governance of priority fisheries and development of the blue economy in Seychelles. The main beneficiaries of the bond are Seychellois who depend on marine resources and the ocean for their livelihoods, including artisanal and semi-industrial fisheries, tourism operators and operators engaged in seafood value chains, among others. The bond will also contribute to the World Bank’s South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Program (SWIOFish3), which supports countries in the region to increase economic benefits from their fisheries sectors while sustainably managing their fisheries.

Seychelles’ Vice President Vincent Meriton said the blue bond is part of an initiative that combines public and private investment to mobilize resources to empower local communities and businesses. Meriton emphasized the bond will assist Seychelles “in achieving a transition to sustainable fisheries and safeguarding our oceans while we sustainably develop our blue economy.”

The World Bank emphasized that the bond “demonstrates the potential for countries to harness capital markets for financing the sustainable use of marine resources.” The World Bank’s Vice President of Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck, said the Bank believes this sovereign blue bond “can serve as a model for other small island developing States and coastal countries,” and is a signal that investors are increasingly interested in supporting sustainable management and development of the world’s oceans.

The Our Ocean Conferences have resulted in over 1,200 concrete, measurable and tracked commitments in support of sustainable management of the world’s oceans.

Including representatives from more than 20 developing countries, this meeting saw a major shift in focus of GAML–from development and refinement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) indicators toward implementation.

Esther Care Former Brookings Expert R Ramya Vivekanandan Senior Education Specialist, Learning Assessment Systems - GPE Secretariat

UIS plays a critical role in the Education 2030 Agenda by producing cross-nationally comparable education data and works with partners to develop new indicators, methodologies, statistical approaches, and monitoring tools to better assess progress toward international education targets. It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

A primer on the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML)

GAML was convened by the UIS in early 2016 to provide concrete solutions to develop new indicators on learning needed to achieve SDG 4 and set standards for good practices on learning assessments by bringing together technical experts from around the world. Counting more than 250 members representing a wide range of stakeholders from UN Member States, academia, international organizations, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector, GAML is developing the standards and methodologies needed to measure learning globally while helping countries to produce and use the information to achieve SDG 4.

During the meeting, about 20 countries provided their perspectives to inform decision-making across the learning and skills-related indicators. In addition, four countries—Cambodia, Chad, The Gambia, and Tanzania—explained the data they would likely draw on to inform these indicators, as well as the challenges and needs that confront them. Inclusion of a large country contingent and a new decision-making approach differentiated the fifth GAML meeting from previous ones.

Aligning national and international measures of proficiency in math and reading

Day one of the meeting focused on procedural papers that would enable countries to align their learning outcomes data against content in the reading and mathematics areas, and to establish procedures that would enable the verification of appropriate standards of data collection tools. Of interest was the proposal that both statistical and non-statistical methods be used in these processes.

This was a welcome approach for countries that do not engage in international or regional large-scale assessment programs (LSAs), or that use data from national assessments, citizen-led assessments, or early grade reading/mathematics assessments.

Questions raised by countries included how to manage differences in identification of grade versus years of schooling for reporting—for example on Indicator 4.1.1 for Grades 2/3, end of primary, and end of lower secondary, and whether the proposed frameworks for reading and mathematics would provide sufficient guidance to countries in their local comparisons with their national assessment data.

Working out the details of several learning indicators and respective roles in GAML

During the second day, the Task Force working on indicator 4.4 presented extensive research on how to approach digital literacy and ICT indicators, with a subsequent proposal for adoption of a Global Framework on Digital Literacy Skills. The definition proposed for discussion was: “The ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate, and create information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, information literacy, and media literacy.”

Target 4.6 calls on countries to ‟ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy” by 2030. Task Force 4.6 described its methodological work, and the potential identification of different minimum proficiency levels according to country economic levels. Member States did not view establishing different minimum proficiency levels positively, especially given that that many countries vary significantly in their adult literacy proficiencies. However, reporting more than one proficiency level appeared sound, which would enable countries to make visible progress over time in a manner that setting just one level might not.

Task Force 4.7 presented extensive research to inform the global frameworks of education for sustainability and global citizenship. Addressing Indicator 4.7.5 in particular which relates to the “percentage of 15-year-old students showing proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience,” the Task Force discussed a proposal for use of Trends in International Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) Grade 8 assessment of biology and earth science. TIMSS biology includes the topics of ecosystems and human health, while earth science includes the topics of earth’s resources, their use, and conservation.

Recognizing the role of UNICEF rather than UIS as the custodian agency for Indicator 4.2.1 (proportion of children under five years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning, and psychosocial well-being, by sex), it was proposed that Task Force 4.2 dissolve and transfer its materials and research to UNICEF as the latter finalizes reporting approaches and methods.

Similarly illustrating GAML’s dynamic and responsive nature, there was a proposal that the Assessment Implementation Task Force, a cross-cutting group, re-form as the Capacity Development Task Force to focus on implications of the decisions made by the Task Forces, on country implementation, and on the needs that such decisions will stimulate within countries. Brookings and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) proposed to jointly lead this new task force.

As Day 2 drew to a close, countries presented a microcosm of the concerns that had been raised throughout the two days and the challenges they faced. Their questions included:

• What are the continuing gaps in data collection and how might these be addressed?

• What are the issues related to consolidation of data sets across agencies and how to resolve them?

• How to develop simple monitoring tools that could be used at decentralized level to capture learning outcomes?

Remaining challenges in SDG 4 monitoring

Beyond these immediate concerns, reporting against the learning and skills-related indicators of the SDGs raised significant philosophical issues for countries. At the national level, some countries noted a move away from reporting the percentage of students reaching particular levels of proficiency, in favor of more meaningful reporting that indicates actual student proficiencies. Although the positive potential implications of SDG reporting can help countries prioritize education, the apparent inconsistency between global reporting needs and constructive use of assessment nationally may need to be reconciled.

Similarly, where national curricula are not well aligned with the curricula that may increasingly be implied by the frameworks for reporting against the SDGs, will national education systems shift their own learning goals accordingly? When this does not happen, how indicative will data cherry-picked from national resources be of real learning outcomes?

Beyond technical questions and capacity needs, participants raised concerns around identification of stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities within countries. This highlighted the need for coordination across agencies (e.g. assessment units/agencies, EMIS units, and national statistics offices), and clear communication about not only the indicators, but also what data collection tools and data would meet required levels of quality for global reporting standards.

What’s the verdict?

While it may have been daunting for country representatives who were new to this platform to constructively engage in discussion during the packed two-day agenda, it was a successful start thanks to the excellent leadership and coordination of UIS.

Now it’s time for diverse stakeholders within countries to have access to similar information, pull it apart, and consider the best options for their own countries to identify data resources and use their reporting as levers for change.","It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

291,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paris21-reports-on-international-support-to-statistics/,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,PARIS21 Reports on International Support to Statistics,"24 October 2018: The financing for the data agenda has gained visibility over the past five years, but only 56 of the 102 countries with statistical plans have secured adequate financing to implement them, according to a report prepared by PARIS21. In addition, it finds that available information on domestic support for statistics remains a challenge in many developing countries.



The 2018 edition of the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), issued annually by the Secretariat of the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21), aims to provide a full picture of international support to statistics. It identifies factors that are important in constructing well-financed national statistical systems, including: a high level of national political interest; donor alignment with government strategies; legal autonomy or giving legal status to national statistical offices (NSOs); the alignment of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs) with country development plans; and coordination between statistical stakeholders through regular inter-agency meetings. The report mainly provides information until 2016, and is based on “newly available data” from an annual donor survey, and the 2016 Creditor Reporting System (CRS) – the official source of information on aid commitments from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, and some multilateral organizations.

According to the report, support to statistics amounted to US$623 million in 2016, marking a 5% increase from 2015, and the share of official development assistance (ODA) focused on data and statistics was 0.33%. However, the overall amount of funding for data and statistics remains low, and support remains concentrated on certain countries, with the top 25 recipients receiving nearly half of the support dedicated to 165 countries. The top-ten support recipients for 2006-2016 were Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Vietnam.

The report indicates that a large share of global support to statistics continues to come from a very small number of providers. The top five providers of development cooperation in statistics are the World Bank, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Eurostat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which contributed 69% of total commitments in 2016. Also, based on a survey on Global Private Philanthropy for Development presented by the OECD in 2018, private philanthropy organizations are getting more involved in statistical development, the report says. Private foundations provided US$23.9 billion from 2013 to 2015, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the most significant of the foundations surveyed, providing 49% of total resources.

Only two of nine SIDS have their national strategy for statistical development fully funded and under implementation.

On areas benefiting the most from statistical support, the report outlines demographic and social statistics (28% of total commitments in 2016), adding that environmental and multi-sectoral statistics “reached a record level” with the adoption of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On gender, it notes that statistics are not prioritized in data collection, resources devoted to them remain “grossly inadequate,” and the three areas where statistical investments are more focused are: sexual and reproductive health and rights, eliminating violence against women, and women’s economic empowerment.

On regional allocations, the report indicates that: Africa received the largest share of statistical support with 56% in 2014-2016; the share of total statistical support committed to Latin America and the Caribbean increased from 5% to 8%, driven by several commitments to national censuses in the region; and the share of commitments received by Asia and Pacific fell by half, due to the fact that some large projects committed in 2013 were no longer included for the 2014-2016 period.

On small island developing States (SIDS), the report notes that commitments to SIDS remain low. It adds that most SIDS are lagging behind in terms of building statistical infrastructure and developing statistical planning, and only two out of nine SIDS have their national strategy for development of statistics fully funded and under implementation.

On fragile states, the report mentions that statistical systems have made progress in strengthening their statistical capacities, but a lack of resources and technical skills has persisted. The authors call for more commitments and long-term investment for strengthening systems and capacity development in contexts experiencing fragility to implement and monitor National Development Plans (NDPs), and the SDGs, and to fill sector-specific gaps in areas such as environmental and economic statistics.

In terms of international initiatives on supporting data and statistics, the report states that a new PARIS21 study is currently exploring the feasibility of setting up a Global Fund for Development Data, that could feed into the reflection regarding a funding framework to underpin the implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan. The report points to the creation of a Data for Development group within the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), to discuss data strategies for development and identify good data for development practices in areas such as financing, partnerships with donors and evaluating data interventions. It also mentions a collaboration on a gender statistics programme between PARIS21 and UN Women, within the framework of the Making Every Woman and Girl Count global flagship initiative.

PARIS21 is a global network of statisticians, policymakers, analysts, and development practitioners which facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision making, and coordinates donor support to statistics with the main objective to achieve national and international development goals and reduce poverty in low and middle-income countries. It was established by the UN, the European Commission, the OECD, the IMF, and the World Bank. Its Secretariat is hosted within the OECD’s Statistics and Data Directorate.

According to the report, support to statistics amounted to US$623 million in 2016, marking a 5% increase from 2015, and the share of official development assistance (ODA) focused on data and statistics was 0.33%.
The report indicates that a large share of global support to statistics continues to come from a very small number of providers.

Commitments focus on the Conference’s six themes: marine protected areas (MPAs); sustainable fisheries; marine pollution; climate change; sustainable blue economy; and maritime security. The US$10.7 billion in pledges represent commitments from a wide range of actors, with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the corporate sector announcing the majority of the commitments.

The Conference convened from 29-30 October in Bali, Indonesia, and focused on the theme, ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy,’ with participants reflecting on choices and actions to maintain the sustainability of ocean resources and to preserve ocean health, as heritage presented for our children and grandchildren. The 2018 Conference also featured the third ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy Youth Leadership Summit.’

Indonesia announced 23 commitments, amounting to over US$80 million. In addition, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, said the government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target date of 2020. Indonesia’s commitments focus on improving management effectiveness of existing MPAs, designating additional MPAs and protecting sensitive marine ecosystems, among other actions.

The EU made 23 new commitments across the six themes of the Our Ocean Conference, representing approximately 300 million Euros. On the blue economy, the EU announced, inter alia: joint action with China on marine data; a research and innovation agenda for the Black Sea basin; promotion of ‘Blue Labs’ in the EU to research and develop products or services in support of the blue economy; four regional projects under its satellite monitoring programme, bringing together 18 African countries and the African Union (AU) to develop services related to fisheries and aquaculture, coastal vulnerability and risk management, coastal ecosystems monitoring, ship trafficking and development of regional ocean forecast centers in Africa and the Indian Ocean; and support for the sustainable development of Seychelles’ fisheries sector. The EU will also enhance cooperation with South Africa and Brazil towards an All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance that will assess ecosystems, map the seafloor and develop innovative ecosystem-based aquaculture systems with the aim of having over 1,000 research teams working from Antarctica to the Arctic by 2020.

On marine protection, the EU announced, inter alia: projects to protect marine ecosystems and promote exchange of knowledge on effective management of MPAs between the Atlantic and Southeast Asia; a regional support programme for the sustainable management of natural resources in Pacific Overseas Countries and Territories; and a new version of the ‘Digital Observatory for Protected Areas’ (DOPA), an online database and information system on terrestrial, marine and coastal protected areas.

The Indonesian Government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target data of 2020.

On marine pollution, the EU announced, inter alia: a project to reduce plastic waste and marine litter in South East Asia, with the aim of supporting a transition to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) of plastic and reduction of marine litter; the upgrade of its ‘Floating Macro Litter Monitoring Application’ to make information on marine pollution from rivers accessible to the general public; and support for a waste management programme for the Pacific countries to address marine litter, biodiversity conservation and health and well-being. As part of its new plastics strategy, the EU announced it has initiated new rules on packaging to improve plastic recycling and increase demand for recycled plastic; measures to curb plastic waste and littering; and development of harmonized rules for defining and labeling biodegradable and compostable plastics, among other actions.

On climate change, the EU committed to start designing new ocean forecasting models to support the further development of the its satellite monitoring programme. Improved forecasting is expected to help the EU plan ahead and support decision making to tackle climate change impacts and build resilience to climate risks, including coastal erosion, floods and storm surges.

The US made 15 commitments, including two five-year programmes in Madagascar to improve community-based management of marine and coastal resources and support improvements in the enabling environment for community-based biodiversity conservation and sustainable development approaches and the ‘Fish Right Program’ in the Philippines to increase fish stocks by improving fisheries management and building the resilience of fishing communities. In Central America, the US will support biodiversity conservation in targeted coastal marine areas and upland ecosystems in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Additional commitments will provide support to, inter alia: the Tropical Pacific Observing Systems (TPOS) 2020 Project to improve understanding of the ocean’s role in climate and weather and of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ocean Acidification International Coordination Center (OA-ICC); efforts to tackle illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, piracy and human trafficking; efforts to promote sustainable waste management systems to prevent marine debris from entering the ocean; and research initiatives on coastal wetland ecosystems.

On marine pollution, many countries committed to reduce waste and improve waste management to reduce marine plastic pollution in the oceans, including Chile, the EU, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands and Thailand. Norway will assist developing countries to combat marine litter and microplastics through the World Bank’s fund PROBLUE. The World Bank committed over US$1 billion over the next seven years to advance sustainable oceans and the blue economy, including US$250 million to address marine litter and pollution.

Several companies announced plans to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in their materials, in line with a global commitment to eliminate plastic waste, launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). Danone-Aqua committed to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50 percent by 2025 and to ensure all plastic packaging is 100 percent recyclable. Nestle will make its packaging 100 percent recyclable or reusable by 2025. The Coca-Cola Company will contribute to a circular economy by making its packaging 100 percent recyclable by 2025 and including 50 percent recycled content across the company’s primary packaging globally by 2030. Unilever will ensure 100 percent of its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and increase recycled plastic content in its packaging to at least 35 percent by 2025.

Numerous countries and other stakeholders announced MPA commitments, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Panama, Peru, Poland and Sweden. New Caledonia will protect its seamounts by the end of 2019. Papua New Guinea (PNG) announced plans to triple its MPA coverage and to designate national marine sanctuaries in ten percent of its offshore waters by 2025, and to establish MPAs in ten percent of its territorial waters and coastline by 2025. The UK will triple its current targets to ensure that 30 percent of the ocean is designated as an MPA by 2030. The UK will also publish a cross-Government International Ocean Strategy by the end of 2018 that sets out the country’s contribution to achieving SDG 14 (life below water) through global governance and international cooperation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) committed US$50 million to create, expand and improve the effectiveness of over eight million hectares of MPAs as part of its new cycle of funding.

On sustainable fisheries, Chile committed to protect 98 percent of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from bottom trawling. The Netherlands announced additional support for the development and publication of the Seafood Stewardship Index, explaining that this commitment will contribute to SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 14 and 15 (life on land). Norway will support science for better management of ecosystems and fisheries, including through a three-month research cruise in Antarctica. Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Ireland, Japan, Peru and Thailand also announced commitments.

The landing page of the website also outlines job openings in the three areas of reform.



The UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda aims to enhance the UN’s contribution to sustainable development, ensure more effective capacities to tackle conflict and sustain peace, and improve the UN’s internal management and ability to deliver. As noted in the SDG Knowledge Hub’s Annotated Guide to the UN Secretary-General’s Reform Proposals, the three reform tracks address the fragmentation and bureaucratization of the UN system, which cause gaps, duplication of work, and resource drainage.

On development reform, the ‘United to Reform’ website notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require bold changes to the UN development system for the emergence of a new generation of country teams, centered on a strategic UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and led by an impartial, independent and empowered resident coordinator (RC). The website includes information on the RC’s role, and on the transition team that has been created to provide strategic leadership and oversight to all aspects of the repositioning of the UN development system. The site also features frequently asked questions (FAQs), as well as a backgrounder and key messages on UN development system repositioning.

On management, the website says the reform process seeks to empower managers and staff in the UN and its Secretariat, simplify processes, increase transparency and accountability, and improve on the delivery of UN mandates. It explains that the reorganization of the existing UN Department of Field Support and the UN Department of Management into two new departments (the UN Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the UN Department of Operational Support) seeks to ensure that UN management structures better support all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.

The ‘Management reform’ section of the website also outlines priority areas for improvement, including: improving the speed and responsiveness of service delivery; establishing greater coherence in management structures; strengthening performance management culture; ensuring effective management of resources for mandate implementation; enhancing transparency and accountability; and increasing trust between UN Member States and the UN Secretariat.

Per the website, the peace and security reform process comprises five elements: 1) creating a UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a UN Department of Peace Operations; 2) creating a single political-operational structure with regional responsibilities under the UN Assistant Secretaries-General; 3) establishing a Standing Principals’ Group of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Under-Secretaries-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations; 4) enhancing certain priority areas to ensure coherence and coordination across the peace and security pillar; and 5) introducing several non-structural changes “in the way the peace and security pillar works.”

The website also notes that the peace and security reform aims at, inter alia, prioritizing prevention and sustaining peace, enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of peacekeeping operations and special political missions, and ensuring a closer alignment between peace and security, UN development and human rights pillars.

More than 290 of the world’s leading packaging brands have committed to ensure that 100 percent of plastic packaging can be reused, recycled or composted by 2025.

The ‘New Plastics Economy Global Commitment’ focuses on three actions to achieve a circular economy for plastic in which it never becomes waste. First, the Commitment signatories will aim to eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use to reuse packaging models. Additional targets include to: innovate to ensure 100 percent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled or composed by 2025; and circulate the plastic produced by significantly increasing the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging or products. The targets will be reviewed every 18 months, with the goal of making them increasingly ambitious in future years.

Businesses, governments and others around the world unite behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic.

Signatories to the Global Commitment represent 20 percent of all plastic packaging produced globally. Danone, H&M Group, L’Oreal, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Mars, Incorporated are among the consumer businesses that have made commitments alongside packing producers such as Amcor and plastics producers, including Novamont. Businesses that sign the commitment will publish annual data on their progress to ensure transparency and drive momentum.

Ellen MacArthur announced the initiative at the Our Ocean Conference, underscoring the importance of stopping plastic from entering the oceans. She said that the “New Plastics Economy Global Commitments draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic.” UNEP Executive Director, Erik Solheim, described the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment as the “most ambitious set of targets we have seen yet in the fight to beat plastics pollution.”

The Global Commitment is in line with SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) targets on sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (target 12.2) and reduction of waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (target 12.5). These actions also contribute to SDG 14 (life below water), including target 14.1 on preventing and reducing marine pollution of all kinds.

The Our Ocean Conferences have resulted in over 1,200 concrete, measurable and tracked commitments in support of sustainable management of the world’s oceans.

The note synthesizes discussions that took place on mitigation, transparency, finance and adaptation in breakout groups, as well on the Talanoa Dialogue in a plenary session.

The summaries highlight areas of convergence on the various issues, as well as remaining gaps in consensus that will need to be overcome in Katowice, Poland, where COP 24 will meet from 2-14 December to agree the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The adaptation summary mentions, inter alia, the need for: parity between mitigation and adaptation, particularly regarding finance; adaptation support for developing countries; the adaptation communication to not represent an additional burden; and consistency in the guidance both on communication and reporting. Participants disagreed on such issues as whether guidance should be overarching or more tailored to specific contexts.

On the Talanoa Dialogue, many leaned towards the idea of a Presidencies’ declaration with an option of an additional paragraph in a COP decision.

On mitigation, participants discussed element of guidance information for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) to enable the tracking of progress towards achieving nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the enhanced transparency framework, the need to respect the diversity of NDCs and their nationally determined nature, and the applicability of the ICTU guidance, among other things.

On finance, the breakout group discussed, inter alia, the relevance of the long-term goal on aligning financial flows and its potential for unleashing finance, accessibility of climate finance, the enhanced need for financial resources in light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15), and the need for reporting on both mobilized and received finance.

On transparency, the pre-COP highlighted that the enhanced transparency framework (EST) should, inter alia, be dynamic, facilitative and non-punitive. Meeting participants agreed that additional discussions were required on issues including: the concept of transition; the relationship between flexibility and national circumstances; and the role of the expert review team and facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress regarding flexibilities and capacity constraints.

Regarding the Talanoa Dialogue, the session discussed the possible form of the outcome of the political phase, which will take place during the second week of COP 24. Proposals included: a COP decision, including substance relating to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement; a short, procedural COP decision or a paragraph in a COP decision; a ministerial declaration; a Presidencies’ declaration, statement, report or summary; or some combination of the options.

299,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/brazil-launches-first-assessment-on-biodiversity-ecosystem-services/,"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Brazil Launches First Assessment on Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services","8 November 2018: The first Brazilian assessment of the country’s biodiversity and ecosystem services shows why conservation and sustainable use of Brazil’s environmental assets should be central, transversal and strategic elements – not appendices or obstacles – in the socioeconomic development of the country. The document was signed by more than 120 scientists, and represents the most complete survey on the theme ever carried out in Brazil.

The press release notes that the Summary for Policymakers of the ‘First Brazilian Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Assessment’ was launched on 8 November 2018, nine days before the start of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in Egypt from 17-29 November, and two months before the new Brazilian president and State governors take office. The press release emphasizes that the launch marks “a moment as critical as appropriate for the sustainable development agenda in the international and domestic conjuncture,” given that Brazil is the holder of the greatest biodiversity on the planet and the country’s decline of biological wealth has a large impact beyond its borders.

The Summary for Policymakers aims to support decision making in the public and private spheres by outlining the main results consolidated in the First Assessment prepared by a group of more than 120 researchers gathered in the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BPBES).

The document mentions that the Brazilian territory hosts about 42,000 plant species and 9,000 vertebrate species, including high rates of endemism, and almost 130,000 invertebrate species known to science. Of these, 1,173 animal species and more than 2,118 plant species are endangered. According to the assessment, the country is home to 305 indigenous peoples, totaling almost 900,000 people speaking 274 languages. Five million Brazilians belong to traditional knowledge communities that occupy one fourth of the national territory. “Family agriculture” produces 70% of the food consumed by the Brazilian population, and 85 out of 141 economically important cultivated species depend on pollinators.

Contrary to the principles established in the Aichi Targets, Paris Agreement and SDGs, Brazil is systematically dismantling its environmental policy.

According to the authors of the ‘Diagnosis’ of the Assessment, governance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Brazil is “bipolar”: on the one hand, the country has strong and capable institutions; on the other, there are problems of infrastructure, slow processes, legal, social and ecological conflicts and inefficiency in actions. With regard to international agreements, the authors highlight that Brazil is a “protagonist abroad,” as was the case in Nagoya, when the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were agreed, and in the negotiations of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs. However, they stress, internally the country does exactly the contrary to the principles established in those agreements by “systematically dismantling its environmental policy.”

The Summary for Policymakers points out that the window of opportunity to consolidate the basis for a sustainable future in Brazil is limited. The text explains that this would require placing biodiversity and ecosystem services immediately at the center of the economic discussions, in a cross-cutting way, together with a discussion on how to mitigate the threatening drivers.

The Assessment comprises five chapters: introduction of the assessment, its conceptual framework and definitions; nature and quality of life; trends and impacts of drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem services degradation and restoration; current and future interactions between nature and society; and governance and decision-making options across scales and sectors. The assessment was developed in close consultations with representatives of the federal government, civil society, the private sector, and indigenous peoples.

Inspired by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), BPBES was created in 2015. It comprises an independent group of about 120 authors, including university professors, researchers, environmental managers, and decision makers. BPBES aims to produce periodic syntheses of the best available knowledge, generated by academic science and traditional knowledge, on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their relationship with human welfare. In doing so, the Platform is considering six continental biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, Campos Sulinos), as well as coastal and marine areas.

The Global Survey on Sustainability and the SDGs targets individuals and representatives of politics, business, academia, the media and civil society both at the national and international levels. It briefly introduces sustainability and the SDGs, and poses questions to determine: sustainability awareness; which SDGs are of immediate concern to the survey’s respondents and their family; and an assessment of the situation related to chosen SDGs within the “past 12 months.” It also includes questions regarding: actions through which sustainability is taken into consideration, such as buying goods and services, child rearing and education, voting, food and nutrition, leisure activities, transportation and mobility; and actors that should take greater account of sustainability and that should push forward for SDG implementation at the country level.

The online survey was launched in September 2018, and will be accessible until March 2019. Results are expected to be publicly disclosed and discussed with representatives of all sectors.

Branca F Childhood stunting: a global perspective. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era witnessed an unprecedented drop in mortality among children younger than 5 years and in undernutrition across all regions. However, the poorest children remain 1·9 times more likely than others to die before reaching the age of 5 years.If these child mortality trends persist, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) child mortality targets (reducing neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 livebirths and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 livebirths in all countries by 2030) will not be met in 47 countries, 34 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, undernutrition is prevalent in some regions, with an estimated 151 million children affected by stunting worldwide.This situation is further complicated by burgeoning overnutrition together with vitamin and mineral deficiency in early childhood and their links to adult non-communicable diseases. Reversing current trajectories requires not only applying lessons learned from the MDG era but also addressing all the determinants of child health and wellbeing that will impact whether today's children achieve their maximum potential in every situation. Indeed, evidence shows that about 50% of the reduction in child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 1990 and 2010 was due to indirect influences beyond the health sector.The focus on the health of children must expand beyond mortality to include healthy growth, development, and wellbeing.

Inheriting a sustainable world: atlas on children's health and the environment. A multisectoral approach that addresses all the determinants (social, economic, cultural, political, environmental, and commercial) of child health and wellbeing resonates with the SDGs' promotion of an integrated approach to global social and economic development.There is increasing recognition, for example, of the importance of early life determinants (stimulation, socialisation, and a stable, clean environment) on child social and economic potential over the life course. The 2016 Lancet early child development Series reported that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in LMICs are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential,with widespread consequent impacts. Further, WHO estimates that 27% of all child deaths now arise from environmental causesand almost 90% of the world's children do not breathe clean air. Clean water and sanitation remain beyond the reach of billions of people, and conflict and insecurity affect the domestic stability of and access to health care, good nutrition, and early child education for many children globally. Coordinated action across multiple sectors is required for all children to be able to develop their maximum potential in every country and community. All nations aspire to see their children develop and flourish as a human right and as the basis for a strong economy. In this context, there is a need for guidance and agreement on maximising child health and wellbeing in the SDG era.

On bathwater, babies, and designing programs for impact: evaluations of the Integrated Community Case Management Strategy in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Malawi. In response to this need, and after reviews of several global child health approaches and policies,WHO and UNICEF have initiated a Lancet Commission on Child Health and Wellbeing, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Commission's findings will be published as a report in The Lancet, expected in 2019. The Commissioners are drawn from every geographical region and from disciplines including maternal and child health, nursing, nutrition, epidemiology, human rights, education, environmental and political science, economics, anthropology, and social science.

The Commissioners met in Dakar, Senegal, in February, 2018, to reflect on the state of the world's children and agreed on a process of elaborating a cross-sectoral agenda on child wellbeing that reflects realities in the SDG era. Consensus emerged around the need to address influences during the first two decades of life, with “child” denoting those aged 0–18 years. Five working groups have been established with experts from many disciplines and global regions to collectively address the following areas.

A group on leadership and governance will address how to secure commitment and accountability at all levels of government, as well as among donors, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations, and corporations. A second group will use a systems lens for multisectoral action, and examine how to bring together diverse systems across different sectors to maximise the health and wellbeing outcomes for children in the first 18 years of life, and how to increase accountability for enabling child health and wellbeing across all platforms and levels. A group on financing and economics will consider challenges around microeconomic modelling for financing and focus on identifying the new partnerships, investment policies, and priorities that will increase the chances of more children thriving by 2030. Equity focused data and information for action and accountability that build capacities for accountability and agency will be addressed by a fourth group. Finally, a fifth group will explore family, household, and community approaches to health and wellbeing, and will identify priorities for governments and districts in different settings and how to support the most marginalised communities to build resilience and tackle the drivers of their disadvantage.

This Commission will take a whole of government approach, addressing health and development beyond mortality, and will encapsulate children's perspectives and visions. Of course, context is key. The problems facing Nigeria, Nicaragua, and the Netherlands are different. But there are commonalities. The Commission will focus on the “how to” as opposed to the “what”, the process rather than content. This approach will go beyond a focus on national and ministry decision making. Districts and communities are where multisectoral approaches work best. And community engagement is critical to success; we intend to capture the views, hopes, and dreams of children and young people. At the same time, country ownership and political leadership are necessary. Our Commission will be mindful to align with country level planning processes that address realities on the ground. The methods and findings of the Commission will be inclusive, participatory, and incorporate the perspectives of adolescents and other constituencies, as appropriate.

The Commission's report will not only examine the successes and lessons learned from previous efforts but will also strive to balance optimism with acknowledged harsh realities. Solutions for child health and wellbeing will be viewed through the lens of protection, promotion, prevention, and treatment. We want to build the case for a coordinated response from government, business, and civil society that acknowledges the interdependent nature of the challenge to sustainably improve children's lives in different settings. And we shall suggest monitoring indicators that nations can use to assess progress between now and 2030.

Investment in our children is the first step towards cultivating a healthy, productive society, and should be central to any government's policy and in line with the statutes of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We are confident that the experience and passion of our Commissioners for this topic can benefit generations of children to come.

They also welcomed a regional review report, which draws on data from countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of achievements toward the 2030 Agenda, among other sources. Participants highlighted the need for increasing investments in realizing reproductive rights and gender equality.

European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with a “triple burden” falling on middle-aged women.

The regional report presented by UNECE and UNFPA titled, ‘Fulfilling the Potential of Present and Future Generations,’ presents an overview of regional population trends, and highlights areas of stress requiring policy responses. For example, the authors note that European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with the largest portion of care falling on middle-aged women who often undertake a “triple burden” as they care for younger and older generations, while still remaining engaged in the labor force.

Other issues include low fertility, youth unemployment and complex migration movements, with negative net migration a feature of eastern Europe, while western countries experienced positive net migrant inflows. Unemployment, poverty and insufficient social protection are still issues for some UNECE Member States.

Speakers at the conference drew attention to gender inequalities in workforce participation, earnings, and access to leadership positions. They called for investing in human capital and creating enabling environments for stability, wellbeing and prosperity.

The principles will promote implementation and achievement of SDG 14 (life below water) and ensure that ocean-related investment delivers long-term value without negatively impacting marine ecosystems, carbon emission reductions or the livelihoods of people who depend on the oceans and their resources.

The launch of the ‘Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles’ follows a commitment by the partners at the 2017 Our Ocean Conference to support the development of a sustainable blue economy. To support this goal, the organizations agreed to develop a set of sustainability principles to guide investment in and financing decisions on the blue economy, with the aim of announcing the principles in 2018. The organizations developed the principles with support from Accenture Development Partnerships, following broad consultation with finance, industry, insurance companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles put forward 14 Principles: seven recognized principles for sustainable investment and seven principles focused on the blue economy. The Principles set out ocean-specific standards while avoiding duplication of existing responsible investment frameworks and complying with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards and the EIB Environmental and Social Principles and Standards. The Principles provide guidance on how to ensure that investments support more sustainable marine and coastal development and ensure the sustainability of ocean ecosystems. The Principles aim to engage investors, insurers and banks “to bring sustainability into the boardrooms of all ocean-based industries,” including aquaculture, biotechnology, energy, fisheries, shipping and tourism.

This collaborative initiative to finance a sustainable blue economy is not only timely and complementary – it is absolutely urgent and necessary.

To support implementation of the Principles, the organizations are developing an IT-based tool to help investment managers assess whether their investment decisions are verifiably sustainable.

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) Executive Director, Erik Solheim, said that, amid intensifying threats to the ocean, including unsustainable fishing, plastic pollution, coral reef destruction and ocean acidification, “this collaborative initiative to finance a sustainable blue economy is not only timely and complementary – it is absolutely urgent and necessary.” European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Karmenu Vella, and EIB Vice President, Jonathan Taylor, both welcomed UNEP’s endorsement of the Principles, stressing that this partnership will help to ensure their successful implementation and application on the ground.

A number of international sustainable finance initiatives, including UNEP’s Principles for Sustainable Insurance Initiative (PSI) have endorsed the Principles. The Principles will become part of a new sustainable blue economy finance initiative under the UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), which is also a founding partner in the initiative. The initiative is expected to be launched in 2019 and will receive financial support from the EC.

The Our Ocean Conferences have resulted in over 1,200 concrete, measurable and tracked commitments in support of sustainable management of the world’s oceans. The 2018 Our Ocean Conference took place in Bali, Indonesia, from 29-30 October.

304,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-private-sector-action-blended-finance-for-ldcs/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Private Sector Action, Blended Finance for LDCs","With a recent IPCC report calling for “unprecedented” societal transitions and a US government report on national climate impacts projecting major reversals to economic and social progress, this brief looks at the kind of action that can deliver the change needed, and the actors that are poised to have such impacts. Among these actors are private companies that are taking corporate sustainability reporting more seriously and investors with an eye on delivering sustainable development.



This brief starts with recent news on private sector actions, and ends with snapshots of blended finance and entrepreneurship in least developed countries (LDCs).

An article by Tony Wines on Eco-Business argues that investors and businesses—which “have the ability to act faster and more efficiently than public institutions”—may have the best chance of averting climate change. Wines emphasizes the rapid uptake of environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration in investors’ strategies, noting that such issues can affect companies’ performance and reputation. However, he acknowledges that there is “little evidence of integrated reporting targeted at investor audiences,” and thus highlights the need for businesses’ alignment with global frameworks such as the SDGs, which offer a more standardized language for stakeholders across the climate, development and financial spaces.

Further on business alignment with the SDGs, Trucost, part of S&P Global, has developed an SDG Evaluation Tool, which helps businesses identify “SDG-aligned business revenue,” increase transparency, inform sustainable growth strategies and guard against risk. According to a publication by Trucost, the tool works by mapping SDG exposure (risk) across a company’s value chain, evaluating the company’s efforts to manage and mitigate its exposure, and assessing the positive impacts created by the company through its products, services, charitable activities, and other societal contributions in line with the SDGs. In its inaugural application, the methodology was applied to 13 company participants and 21 peers from the technology, financial services, utilities and manufacturing sectors. Findings show that nearly 87% of companies’ revenues have the potential to be SDG-aligned. The report was launched at an event held on 5 November 2018 and accompanied by a news release.

Participants at the 2018 Global Corporate Sustainability Forum discussed how SDG achievement can help sustain competitiveness, shared best practices in implementing SDGs vis-à-vis corporate responsibility initiatives, and discussed linking international initiatives to local actions. The Forum took place from 22-23 November 2018, in Taipei, Taiwan. Taiwan has “entered an era of socially responsible investment” according to Yung-Shuen Shen, Secretary General of the Taiwan Academy of Corporate Sustainability, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) encourages Taiwanese companies to adopt Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as a step towards enhancing sustainability, notes Rebecca Chen of the TWSE.

Such steps are representative of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific region, where corporate sustainability and ESG reporting is rapidly increasing, thereby improving transparency and shining a light on companies’ contributions to or detractions from climate action and sustainable development. An article on Sustainable Brands notes the overarching importance of disclosure—particularly on climate change—to investors, who want to know how companies are managing their exposure to climate risks. It offers the example of Ørsted, an energy company headquartered in Denmark, to guide how climate-related financial disclosure can both increase resilience and examine new opportunities.

To further increase alignment in the corporate reporting landscape, GRI is undertaking a joint project to address “reporting fatigue” caused by multiple or overlapping directives, harmonize definitions and terminology, and simplify corporate reporting such that it becomes more useful and effective. As noted in a GRI press release, the project will be conducted in the context of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue, and was launched during the Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summit in London, UK, as well as in Sydney, Australia during the World Congress of Accountants 2018.

Only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged today is from private sector investors.

Also looking at actors that can leverage private sector investment to the SDGs and the needed climate transitions, Convergence released a data brief that calculates the leverage ratios for a sample of blended finance funds. While leverage ratios must be differentiated according to the conditions of the transaction—including the target sector, country, and impact outcomes—on average, blended finance funds leverage US$4 of commercial capital for every dollar of concessional capital. However, the brief notes that only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged is from private sector investors, with the majority coming from development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs).

For those new to the term, ‘blended finance,’ Convergence explains it as the use of capital from public or philanthropic sources to increase private sector investment towards sustainable development, particularly in developing countries. Blended finance can take shape through a variety of transactions, including those with concessional development funding, impact bonds, or grant funding to support projects’ early stages or technical assistance facilities, among others. Convergence released ‘The State of Blended Finance 2018’ report in September of this year.

The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) released report titled, ‘Blended Finance in the Least Development Countries,’ which responds to limited evidence on where, how, why, and in which sectors blended approaches are being deployed in LDCs; the opportunities and challenges with blended finance strategies; and the conditions under which blended finance is most effective. The report comprises four sections: 1) applying blended finance in LDCs, which analyzes the latest financial data, notes barriers and discusses issues of development effectiveness; 2) country case studies from Africa and Asia; 3) guest pieces on a variety of SDG-relevant topics; and 4) the action agenda moving forward, which identifies five areas where action is needed form all stakeholders. The report was developed in collaboration with Convergence, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Southern Voice and UN Foundation.

A blog post relating to the report’s findings by Convergence’s Justice Johnston highlights that LDCs rely heavily on concessional financing, which comprises upwards of 60% of total external finance. It notes that weak enabling environments in LDCs act as deterrents to private investment and serve to increase the risk premiums. Additional project-specific barriers include limited credit histories and lack of market data, which lead investors to seek greater returns to offset increased risks. Thus, blended finance in LDCs may require greater proportions of concessional finance to attract commercial investment or demonstrate viability. Key sectors where blended finance holds promise in LDCs include energy, financial services and infrastructure, though Johnston underscores that in some cases, pure public financing remains the most suitable option. A UNCDF news release on the report is also available.

For those seeking to learn more on blended and private finance strategies, the OECD is hosting Private Finance for Sustainable Development (PF4SD) Week from 15-18 January 2019 at their Boulogne Conference Center in Paris, France. The week will kick off with the launch of a report titled, ‘The Impact Imperative for Financing Sustainable Development.’

On LDCs, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released ‘The Least Developed Countries Report 2018: Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation – Beyond Business as Usual.’ The report appraises the entrepreneurial landscape in the 47 LDCs, examines conditions for creating high-impact businesses, and identifies common structural features of LDCs’ economies that can hinder entrepreneurship. These include: lack of (or weak) institutions, insufficient infrastructure, limited finances and high registration costs, and elevated risks, as noted by the above Convergence blog. The report notes that self-employment constitutes the vast majority of entrepreneurship in LDCs, but laments that there is little capacity to innovate or grow, and thus calls for policies towards a renewed “developmental state” that brings in the private sector to “chart a clear path for development” through “mission-oriented investments.”

An UNCTAD press release consolidates the report’s key facts and figures on the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs, local entrepreneurship in global production systems, constraints to firms’ growth in LDCs, and current policy frameworks. Separately, comprehensive economic and social statistics on LDCs, compiled by UNCTAD are also available.

The Initiative is a collaboration between the two global treaties with a mandate to conserve endangered species: the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).

According to CMS, the range States identify habitat loss, fragmentation and conversion, increasing trade in lion specimens and live cheetah, prey depletion and retaliatory killing of carnivores by livestock owners as contributing to the “rapid decline” of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions across most of Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Assessments found that leopards inhabit 51 percent of their historic range, lions occupy 17 percent of their historic range, cheetahs occupy nine percent and African wild dogs inhabit only six percent of their historic range.

In response to these trends and related concerns, range States of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions met in Bonn, Germany, from 5-8 November to establish the African Carnivore Initiative. Range States agreed on several priority measures: developing and implementing conservation strategies for each of the four species; creating and maintaining a network of healthy ecosystems to address fragmented habitats; and finding solutions to human-wildlife conflicts and facilitating coexistence. The Initiative will also work to increase sustainable livelihoods benefits to communities, reduce the costs to communities of living alongside wildlife and increase awareness on the plight of African carnivores to ensure long-term success of conservation action.

African wild dogs inhabit only six percent of their historic range.

The African Carnivore Initiative will also close knowledge gaps, and develop and promote monitoring protocols for large carnivore populations, including to increase the availability of relevant information to support informed decision making. The Initiative will provide support to range States to monitor the populations of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions.

In a communique, the range States invite the Conferences of Parties (COP) to CITES at its 18th meeting and the COP of CMS at its 13th meeting to instruct the development of a Joint Programme of Work for the Initiative, in line with the identified priority measures. The States also call for a national coordination structure based on the ‘Range Wide Conservation Programme for Cheetah and Wild Dog’ to provide technical support and training to coordinators and a platform for regular meetings.

The collaboration between CITES and CMS will enable the Initiative to tackle carnivore conservation from two different angles. CITES regulates international trade, and aims to end illegal trade in wildlife. CMS focuses on broad conservation measures, like establishment of ecological corridors, habitat protection and mitigation of human-wildlife conflict.

The range States that participated in the meeting are Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The agenda aims to support achievement of the CBD’s Vision of Living in Harmony with Nature by 2050.

Egypt, as the President of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, and China, as the future host of COP 15, launched, on 15 November, the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’ in collaboration with the CBD at the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is convening from 14-29 November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

The action agenda has three main objectives: to raise public awareness about the urgent need to stem biodiversity loss and restore biodiversity health for both humanity and the global ecosystem; to inspire and implement nature-based solutions to meet key global challenges; and to catalyze cooperative initiatives in support of global biodiversity goals. The action agenda will be hosted on an online platform that will receive and showcase commitments and contributions to biodiversity from stakeholders across all sectors in advance of COP 15, which will convene in Beijing, China, in 2020. This platform will enable the mapping of global biodiversity efforts, and help to identify key gaps and estimate impact.

The action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.

In explaining the rationale for the action agenda, the CBD states that humans have modified 77 percent of land on Earth, excluding Antarctica, an increase from 15 percent a century ago. Vertebrate populations have declined by 60 percent from 1970 levels, and the oceans have absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought, posing additional challenges to efforts to limit global warming. The CBD states that “we are rapidly destroying nature” but stresses that society has the knowledge and skills to change the current path and trajectory. Within this context, the action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship “from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.”

The action agenda will place special emphasis on the nature-climate-oceans-water-land nexus and action areas related to the SDGs. The initiative welcomes the announcements of additional initiatives to raise ambition in conservation, sustainable use and access and benefit sharing (ABS) and in mainstreaming conservation measures and biodiversity solutions across all sectors.

We are one-fifth of our way towards 2030, but miles behind on achieving the lofty goals to reduce poverty, increase prosperity, protect the planet and advance peace.

There are worrying signs that the number of extremely poor people in the world – which has long been dropping – may stop falling and might even start rising. And after years of decline, hunger is increasing – with observers linking this to regional conflicts and climate change. Of most concern: the world’s development agenda, based around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is not fit for purpose.

The development agenda is flawed because it is the inevitable result of trying to be all things to all people. The highly successful Millennium Development Goals which preceded SDGs were short and sharp – and made a huge difference to global progress – yet were criticised for having been non-inclusive.

In response, the UN laudably invited a long list of players to create SDGs – but then failed to prioritise the Agenda to make it manageable and implementable.

Thus, vitally important targets – such as the eradication of all forms of malnutrition, and getting more boys and girls into school – are devalued by being placed on an equal footing with targets as peripheral and vague as promoting “sustainable tourism”, ensuring that people are informed about how to have “lifestyles in harmony with nature”, and creating more green spaces for “women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities”.

Faced with the impossibly long list, in three years only two countries – India and Germany – have made even a partial assessment of how much investment is required for the goals. The Agenda is woefully underfunded – one estimate shows $2.5 trillion more needed each year. Even if we spent all of the world’s development funding it would only get us 5% of the way. We really have to prioritise what we want first.

This was clear even when SDGs were being created. My thinktank, Copenhagen Consensus Center, analysed SDG targets in real time as they were drafted, and enlisted a panel of Nobel laureate economists to identify the most and least effective. Their findings make it clear what needs to be done. If we want to get out in front of increasing hunger, then we need to tackle the problem effectively.

Climate and peacekeeping policies are expensive and complex, and at best do very little to solve problems like hunger, even in relatively long time frames. Yet, cheap investments can be made in fixing micronutrient deficiencies in children, helping immensely and right now.

Investing an extra $8 billion annually in agricultural R&D would increase yields globally, generating more food at lower cost. It could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent 5 million cases of child malnourishment, with each dollar producing $35 of social benefits.

This has the added effect of helping the world’s poorest: the World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors.

Poverty has a simple solution: As in China, free trade can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Although Trump makes it harder, we have been dithering for much longer. We must revive the WTO’s Doha Round, which would lift 145 million people out of poverty by 2030. It could make the average person in the developing world $1,000 better off every year – allowing them to not only better feed themselves and their children, but also afford better health care, more education and lead more prosperous lives.

Improved agricultural yields and freer trade are two of 19 concrete, specific development targets that the Nobels identified to do the most, for every dollar invested, to help the world’s poorest, protect the environment, and improve billions of lives. Others include achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs. Focussing on these top 19 targets would achieve about four times more benefits than just thinly spreading funds among all 169 targets.

Because the UN didn’t prioritise when it created the SDGs, nations are making those choices themselves. The biggest risk is that their selection will not be based on which targets could do the most good, but on far more capricious measures such as which targets have more media-friendly images or the most NGO attention. There are some worrying signs.

A preliminary analysis by the OECD shows that rich nations are closest to reaching targets related to ‘Planet and Partnership’ – in other words, issues like climate, biodiversity and oceans. These are issues that fill a lot of column inches in newspapers, and are focussed on by the chattering classes. But global polls consistently show that people care much more about the areas where these countries are lagging behind: the economy, jobs and education, and peace. Three years into the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda, it is clear that we are trying to do too much – and failing to do enough that matters.

The Roadmap seeks to protect key jaguar corridors while also contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

The jaguar ranges across 18 countries in Latin America. As a result of habitat loss and fragmentation, human-jaguar conflict and illegal poaching, 50 percent of the jaguar’s original range has been lost, and the jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), successful jaguar conservation requires landscape planning and management in development and economic sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and infrastructure, to maintain biodiversity and connectivity. By conserving jaguars, conservation initiatives also maintain biodiversity, forests, carbon, watersheds and cultural and national heritage, and support achievement of the SDGs, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap for the Americas aims to strengthen the Jaguar Corridor, which ranges from Argentina to Mexico, by securing 30 priority jaguar conservation landscapes by 2030. The regional initiative will strengthen international cooperation and raise awareness on jaguar protection initiatives, such as connecting and promoting jaguar habitats, mitigating human-jaguar conflict and promoting sustainable development opportunities that support the well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities. The initiative also seeks to raise awareness on the jaguar’s role as a keystone species whose presence is indicative of a healthy ecosystem. The Roadmap outlines four strategic conservation pathways: coordinating at a range level to support protection and connectivity; developing and implementing range countries’ strategies and improving contributions to transboundary efforts; scaling up conservation-compatible sustainable development models in jaguar corridors; and enhancing the financial sustainability of systems and actions to conserve jaguars and their ecosystems.

UNDP Head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Midori Paxton, said the Jaguar Conservation Roadmap “represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs” and will help protect key jaguar corridors in ways that strengthen sustainable livelihoods for local communities and open up business opportunities for sustainable agriculture and ecotourism.

Also in support of jaguar conservation, the UNDP, Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and government representatives announced the creation of the first-ever Jaguar Day to raise awareness about threats facing the jaguar and conservation efforts in support of the species. The Day will be celebrated annually on 29 November.

The Roadmap’s release comes after a UN high-level forum that resulted in the launch of the ‘Jaguar 2030 New York Statement’ by 14 jaguar range countries and international conservation organizations.

According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day. But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.

Business has a vital role to play in ramping up action against poverty. From creating the jobs and opportunities that lead to sustainable incomes, to lobbying governments to introduce effective poverty-fighting economic policies, firms can make a real difference towards making poverty history, for good. ""Without the private sector, the global goals will not be realised,"" Lisa Kingo, CEO and executive director of the UN Global Compact, told attendees at the SDG Business Forum in New York earlier this year.

But with such a broad, ambitious goal, it is hard for companies to know where to start. BusinessGreen spoke to some of the world's leading experts on how businesses should practically address SDG1 through their own operations - here are their key recommendations.

1. Do no harm

It may be a guiding principle for medical professionals around the world, but the mantra 'do no harm' is also central to any successful business approach to the SDGs. To make sure that firms looking to tackle SDG1 don't roll back on progress in other areas - for example, by clearing rainforest to bring agricultural jobs to a region, at the expense of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions that could lead to worsening poverty down the line - businesses should start their SDG efforts by applying the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UNGC.

""If all companies subscribed to the 10 principles of the UN global compact we would already go a long way to delivering on the global goals,"" she says.

The 10 principles are effectively a checklist for running a good business. They include support and protection for human rights, effective abolition of child labour, a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, and a promise to work against corruption in any form. Adhering to these principles is the first step to ensuring all subsequent actions on the SDGs act as a positive force for sustainable development, rather than an inadvertent impediment to their aims.

2. Understand the problem - and find out which solutions work

Any number of factors conspire to lock people in poverty, from government corruption and conflict, to poor education and extreme weather. The first step to tackling poverty effectively is working out which of those factors are related to your business operations and how exactly you can address it, says Marika McCauley Sine, vice president for global human rights at Mars.

""Poverty is a manifestation of a lack of respect for rights, lack of the ability to manage environmental challenges and threats like climate change, low income and a range of other drivers,"" she says. ""The first step is understanding the barriers that people face to rising up out of poverty and reflecting on one's ability to impact those barriers.""

Mars started this process in its own operations in 2016, by taking a long look at its supply chain to work out where the pressure points are. Its Farmer Income Lab, which launched last year, then set about identifying proven strategies for alleviating poverty among smallholder farmers. ""That's been our brief and our focus for this first year of the Lab - what does work to enable farmers to increase their income?"" says McCauley Sine. ""It's been fascinating to begin to review the evidence base, to take a look at the landscape of what is actually out there in terms of evidence and begin to see what really does work, what people think works but actually may not, and to begin to identify some of the common factors that most successful programs out there share.""

Solving the poverty problem is often not as simple as bumping up the pay for those at the bottom of the ladder, she warns, and firms may need to prepare themselves for more radical change in how their business operates. ""Perhaps historically the business sector has approached the issue of poverty from a livelihood lens,"" she says. ""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains. I think Mars' view is that it is not enough. What we need to do is reflect deeply on the current realities that people face who are in poverty, who are touched in some way by the reach of our global value chains, and consider what real transformation looks like. And where there is poverty, challenging ourselves to go beyond incremental improvements to deliver real transformation"".

3. Don't plump for the obvious goal

If you're a renewable energy company, your first instinct on looking at the SDGs might be to think 'great, we are contributing to SDG 7 - clean and affordable energy - and that's our role in the SDGs sorted'.

Not so fast, says James Gomme, director of SDGs at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ""You need a robust analysis of all of the goals as your starting point, and not passing over anything in that initial scan,"" he says. ""You need to do that initial analysis and have that conversation internally, and perhaps with peers and stakeholders as well, around what SDGs can you really drive direct impact on through your operations and through your supply chain.""

You should only start to narrow down on the goals you want to focus on once that analysis is complete, he adds.

Companies assuming that SDG1 doesn't apply to them is one of the major reasons why it is ranked as a low-priority goal for the business community. But by doing a first broad sweep of all 17 Goals - and understanding how each one touches your business operations - SDG1 may not be so often neglected by the business community.

And don't be fooled into thinking SDG1 is one for governments rather than business because of the way it's written. WBCSD's Gomme advises firms to look past the ""developmental"" language - because there is a clear role for business in tackling poverty.

""All the text is written for governments, and it's written in UN language, and it's a case of understanding how that interacts with your business, and understanding what you can do on that agenda,"" he stresses. ""And the companies that understand that best and put time into interpreting that agenda for their business will be the companies that are ultimately able to leverage the opportunities that the SDGs represent.""

4. Work backwards

Mike Tuffrey, co-founder of sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship, says many corporates are making the mistake of assessing how their activities are already contributing to an SDG, rather than working out what is needed to help hit SDG1's specific ambitions.

Firms should look more closely at the gap between what is happening on the ground today, and where the SDG or its sub-target say we should be in 2030, he says. ""They are not working back on an individual goal from what's required to say 'what do we need to do?'""

It is worth remembering that although the headline SDGs are broad, the 169 sub-targets offer explicit detail on what's expected. SDG1, for example, has five sub-targets:

By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.

By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

To make a real impact on a goal, firms should understand the sub-targets and work backwards, to get a clear idea of the ambition gap that needs filling, Tuffrey concludes.

5. Harness your lobbying power

Tackling SDG1 doesn't necessarily mean flying in armies of volunteers to run resource-intensive projects on the ground - companies should not disregard their influence to change government and social policy, argues Oxfam's Matthew Spencer.

He points to the example of Myanmar, where in 2015 the government was proposing to create a minimum wage of US$2.60 per day for workers. Garment manufacturers in the country were proposing an opt-out for their industry, but after 30 European companies including Tesco and M&S wrote to the Myanmar government opposing the suggestion on the grounds that it would deter them from investing in the country, the government forced through the new base wage.

""That [letter] helped give the government confidence that they could go through with that sensible social protection, anti-poverty measure, and as a result 30,000 garment workers have benefited,"" Spencer says. ""So that's an example of business working to improve the conditions of the poorest in their supply chain.""

6. And if in doubt, start with the UN's four top actions

The UN Global Compact has helpfully identified for top business actions for SDG1, for firms still struggling to determine how best to play their part.

Karbassi explains: ""In the case of SDG1 we have four actions that we identify as business leading actions. The first one is the creation of secure and decent jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations.

""The second one is the empowerment of disadvantaged groups, particularly in terms of economic empowerment.

""Then we have the engagement of companies around their supply chain, and the ability to provide decent working conditions for employees around the supply chain"".

Finally the fourth action is around developing goods and services ""that would target vulnerable groups"" and grow the green economy. ""There's a whole market around that which is not fully taken advantage of,"" she says - pointing to products such as mobile banking applications, microloans, and home solar systems.","As things currently stand, the world is on track to miss the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which targets the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day.
But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.
""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains.

And on paper, at least, the case is certainly hard to argue with.

According to the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, achieving the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could open up $12tr of market opportunities in food and agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and well-being alone, creating 380 million new jobs by 2030 in the process. Meanwhile, the theory goes, we should all find ourselves living on a far cleaner, greener, fairer, more secure, and more prosperous planet once the goals are met.

All that, you would think, goes quite some way towards justifying and incentivising the $5-7tr of investment the UN expects will be needed to meet the SDGs through to 2030.

Yet, projections aside, there have to date been few attempts to actually quantify the impact the SDGs are already having on the global economy, despite the fact 193 countries, 9,000 companies, and investors worth more than $4tr in assets have so far pledged their support for the goals. However, a new tool developed by ESG analyst Trucost looks to do just that.

Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

The startling findings are the result of a new SDG Evaluation Tool developed by Trucost which provides quantitative analysis of company performance against the SDGs across the value chain, from raw material inputs to product use and disposal, within the context of a firm's geographical location.

Trucost, which is part of S&P Global, began working alongside multiple companies, investors, and academics earlier this year to develop the set of metrics, which are aimed at providing market participants with the data transparency needed to accelerate progress on the UN goals.

Among the 13 companies which agreed to take part in the inaugural application of the Tool were renewables firms Iberdrola and Ørsted, as well as a variety of major corporates such as Rockwool, the Walgreens Boots Alliance, HP and, of course, S&P Global. The advisory panel for the research, meanwhile, included the London School of Economics, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Overall it found the 13 companies generated almost $233bn of 'SDG-aligned' business revenues in 2017, equivalent to as much as 87 per cent of their entire revenues that year. If the SDGs represent the world's biggest to do list, then the work is certainly very well paid.

Libby Bernick, managing director and global head of corporate business at Trucost, welcomed the findings. ""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions,"" she added. ""We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

Breaking down the findings, most of the companies' revenues - 79 per cent - derived from products and services which contribute to the SDGs. The results also found companies created ""positive contributions"" across all 17 SDGs, but most significantly in relation to green economy priorities such as Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).

But revenues weren't the only business benefits uncovered by the SDG Tool. Trucost said the analysis shows how working towards the SDGs can help catalyse new ways for companies to think about social and environmental issues - and to guard against risk. After all, the Tool is designed to help companies identify SDG-aligned business value, prioritise risks and opportunities, and inform sustainable growth strategies, not just generate raw revenues.

The companies taking part in the Tool were found to be most active in managing SDG risks associated with responsible consumption and production, including waste and resource efficiency, as set out in SDG 12, as well as issues arising from SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 16 on governance. But while some activity was targeted at addressing supply chain risks, especially with regards to worker conditions, governance, and climate change, the analysis highlighted a need to better manage ESG risks right across the value chain. Moreover, a lack of consistency of action was found across the SDGs, the Tool found, with work on ocean health, hunger and malnutrition largely missing from the 13 companies' sustainability strategies.

As Trucost points out, the analysis shows how such tools and modelling can help screen value chains for SDG risks that companies might otherwise not have been aware of, thereby encouraging better environmental and climate risk disclosure. And given the relative lack of awareness - despite growing take up - of the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), any work to boost understanding of the financial impact of climate change and wider environmental challenges on business is surely welcome.

""The SDGs can encourage companies to consider SDG-related issues that are not commonly monitored and reported in the corporate community, but are still important to the achievement of the SDGs,"" the analysis states.

Given so many firms remain off-track with just 12 years to go to meet the SDGs, there understandably remain significant concerns about the world's ability to deliver on the 17 goals it has set itself by 2030. Far more finance is clearly needed to accelerate action, alongside technological innovation and drastic improvements in the policy environment. But with evidence now emerging that the SDGs are already helping to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue and identify risks at little over a dozen firms, the hope remains that more companies will start to recognise that the huge opportunities that come from embracing sustainable business models are not just a future projection, they are also an existing reality.","Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

From funding female entrepreneurs in Ethiopia to providing more than two million households in Bangladesh with rooftop solar, the IDA is at the coalface of sustainable development around the world.

But after decades of funding its development work solely through its donors, its 173 member countries, 2016 marked a turning point.

Every three years member governments gather at IDA to agree the replenishment rates and consider the institution's priorities for the coming years. The first meeting of IDA18, held just a few months after the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed at the UN, and just weeks after the Paris Agreement on climate change was struck, presented IDA stakeholders with a ""paradigm shift"" in the role of international development. Suddenly climate risk, poverty reduction, and sustainable development were in the global spotlight like never before.

Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is expected to cost between $5tr and $7tr. But in 2016 total official development assistance peaked at just $142.6bn. Looking at the scale of the challenge ahead back in early 2016, IDA made a momentous decision: to seek extra cash from the capital markets for the first time. ""Recognising that more than public money can achieve needs to be done and financed in order to achieve the ambitious SDGs, there was a discussion around bringing in this additional group of stakeholders, the private investors, so that the IDA can do more,"" recalls Heike Reichelt, head of investor relations and new product development at the World Bank.

It was a bold step, but IDA was confident its offer would attract considerable interest, Reichelt tells BusinessGreen. ""One of the reasons why the SDGs have been so warmly embraced by pretty much everyone is because there is this realisation that it's not just governments, it's not just government agencies,"" she explains. ""The private sector has a huge role to play, and the private sector wants to play a role. So it was a very opportune time to look again at IDA's financing model and think about how it can tap private capital.""

Tackling SDG 1 in particular - the target for eradicating poverty - is a key focus for IDA and was a major motivator behind its decision to launch an issuance. ""The SDGs are great and I really like them… but no poverty is in all of them,"" points out Reichelt. ""No hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation - they all move towards no poverty."" She explains IDA's twin goals since its inception are to eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world: ""So if you look at SDG1 - no poverty - that's basically everything we do.""

So with the decision made to reach out to the capital markets to boost IDA's ability to help the world's poorest, Reichelt and her team set off on a 'roadshow' around the world's financial capitals to gauge market interest. The ground had already been prepared by the rise of green and climate bonds, with private investors becoming rapidly more comfortable with impact investing as a mainstream 'liquid' investment opportunity, the term for an investment that can be readily traded and converted into cash.

Reichelt explains: ""There are investors who are focused on impact, focused on the purpose of their investments, and until green bonds impact investing [the market] was all very small, not liquid, type projects. But through green bonds investors have realised that they can have impact by purchasing liquid products.""

This has attracted more risk-averse investors into the market, says Reichelt. ""If you think about impact investing, often times it was investors investing in a particular project in a particular country,"" she explains. ""So those investors are taking the risk that [one project] won't succeed and they won't get repaid... But in the case of bonds, you issue bonds in the capital markets and it's a liquid, tradeable product, a bit like stocks, you can buy and sell them.""

This fitted more neatly with the kind of investors the World Bank traditionally engages with, she says. ""It is investors that are looking for high quality, so in the Triple A rating [category], which is the best credit rating you can get,"" she explains. ""Those are investors that look for safety - so central banks, but also pension funds, asset managers and others.""

Meanwhile, interest in ESG investments is on the rise as the risks of inaction on issues like climate risk become ever starker, and governments around the world push green finance as a growth industry. Investors aren't immune to the reputational bump a well-timed investment in sustainable development can offer either.

So with more larger, cautious players entering the impact investing market, IDA was in a prime position to tout its role as a safe investment bet for doing good. Its 60-year history of loans helped it secure a Triple A rating from the ratings agencies, and its bumper $160bn capital reserve also helped to reassure investors the financials of the issuance were sound.

""[IDA] had a super strong credit, had a good financial product, and then its purpose, its mission, was good,"" recalls Reichelt. ""So it was a very compelling story when we went to see investors.""

""Compelling"" translates into an inaugural bond issue that raised $1.5bn for IDA's lending programme and was heavily over-subscribed. ""We had initially intended to only do $1bn but it was so hard to cut the allocations because it was 4.5 times oversubscribed,"" reveals Reichelt. ""So it was a really tough session, we were talking to investors and some of them really wanted the bonds, so we really had to either cut entirely or give a lot less in bonds to them than they expected.""

Unsuprisingly then, IDA is already planning another bond issuance before its financial year ends in June, eyeing a further capital raise of $1.5bn through a mix of benchmark bonds and private placements. From there Reichelt predicts it will grow steadily, to around $10bn within a decade.

The success of IDA's inaugural issuance represents not just a step change in its strategy, but speaks volumes about the latent demand from the private markets to invest in ways which promote sustainable development. The growing international pressure to eliminate poverty and build a greener, more prosperous society, together with the increasing acceptance of impact investment as a mainstream liquid investment opportunity, have cultivated fertile ground for ethical investments.

Delivering the SDGs will involve billions - perhaps trillions - of investment dollars. But when presented with the right opportunity, it seems private investors are ready and willing to help the world get there.","The International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, has almost 60 years of experience in providing finance to some of the world's poorest countries.

The Summit was the first intergovernmental Summit to take place entirely online.

Over 40 government leaders participated in the virtual Summit, with many urging increased action on climate change. Summit Chair and President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said the virtual Summit shows that “more can be done with tools and means on hand than we might think.” The Marshall Islands announced a new, enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC) during the Summit, stressing vulnerable countries’ commitment “to move from words to action.” President of France Emmanuel Macron also called for countries to present new, more ambitions NDCs and “increase the pace of their implementation.”

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commended the Marshall Islands and the co-chairs for using new technologies to deliver a high-level carbon-free summit. He underscored the need for more creativity along these and other lines to limit global warming to as close to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels as possible, and called on all nations to ensure that the Katowice Climate Change Conference is a success. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet described strengthening mitigation commitments and NDCs as “a human rights obligation.”

Strengthening NDCs is a human rights obligation.

In the Jumemmej Declaration, over 40 government leaders commit to strengthen the level of their national climate efforts by 2020 in order to “trigger increased national contributions from all nations by 2020 to keep the 1.5°C warming limit within reach” as well as safeguard human rights, people everywhere, fragile ecosystems and the planet’s natural wealth. They urge the Katowice Climate Change Conference to act on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) and send a strong signal for all nations and non-State actors to contribute to generation of new ambition and enhancement of all NDCs by 2020. Leaders further call for, inter alia, urgent, further action to enable greater flows of international climate finance to be delivered more rapidly and effectively to facilitate enhanced climate ambition among capacity-constrained developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). ‘Jumemmej’ is Marshallese for “a call to action of vigilance, keeping watch against threats.”

In a Communique, leaders elaborate that the “entirely online format” of the Summit demonstrates their determination to reduce emissions through the creative application of readily available means and to increase inclusivity and transparency while conserving scarce resources. The Communique also states the Forum’s five-point vision of surviving and thriving in a world, where, by 2030 to 2050 at the latest: 1) climate change dangers are kept to an absolute minimum; 2) maximum advantage is taken of the benefits of climate action; 3) maximum resilience is achieved for people, indigenous groups, livelihoods, infrastructure, cultures and ecosystems; 4) the SDGs and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) targets are achieved and, where possible, exceeded or accomplished ahead of schedule; and 5) LDCs and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) emerge as wealthy nations through strong economic growth.

The action plan is in line with IMO’s commitment to support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water).

The ‘IMO Action Plan to Address Marine Plastic Litter from Ships’ recognizes the wide range of land- and sea-based activities through which marine plastic litter enters the marine environment. The plan highlights the negative effects of large plastic items, small plastic particles and microplastics on biodiversity, marine life and human health. In addition, the plan states that marine plastic litter can negatively impact activities like fishing, shipping and tourism.

The plan recommends specific measures to: reduce marine plastic litter generated from, and retrieved by, fishing vessels; reduce shipping’s contribution to marine plastic litter; improve the effectiveness of port reception and facilities and treatment in reducing marine plastic litter; enhance public awareness, education and seafarer training; improve understanding of the contribution of ships to marine plastic litter; improve understanding of the regulatory framework associated with marine plastic litter from ships; strengthen international cooperation; and target technical cooperation and capacity building.

The action plan recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and UNEP.

The action plan identifies a number of specific measures to tackle marine litter and waste, such as promoting reporting the loss of fishing gear and facilitating the delivery of retrieved fishing gear to shore facilities. Other measures suggest: consideration of actions, such as making marking of fishing gear mandatory, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the establishment of a compulsory mechanism to declare loss of containers at sea and identify the number of losses; and reviewing provisions related to the training of fishing vessel personnel and seafarers to ensure awareness of the impact of marine litter.

In addition, the plan proposes: measures to increase awareness and understanding, including a proposed study on marine plastic litter from ships; looking into the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities; and enhancing public awareness on marine plastic litter. The action plan also recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), such as by making information available to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

The action plan will build on and complement existing mechanisms and legislation that address the discharge of waste and plastic in the sea. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) aims to prevent pollution from ships by prohibiting ships from discharging plastic into the sea and requiring governments to ensure adequate port reception facilities to receive ship waste. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention and Protocol) regulates what materials can be dumped at sea and what materials are not permitted. The Action Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The MEPC adopted the action plan at its 73rd session that convened in London, UK, from 22-26 October 2018.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

The study, published in Nature, suggests that these findings may mean that emitted greenhouse (GHG) gases have generated far more heat than scientists originally predicted, meaning that the Earth is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than scientists thought.

The study titled, ‘Quantification of Ocean Heath Uptake from Changes in Atmospheric Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Composition’, assesses ocean warmth using “a whole-ocean thermometer” to measure carbon dioxide and atmospheric oxygen, both of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases. In other words, the researchers measured the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen lost by the oceans, and then calculated the amount of warming needed to explain that change in gases. Previous studies have estimated ocean temperature using hydrographic temperature measurements and data, which the authors argue is an “imperfect ocean dataset.”

The findings suggest that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is even harder than previously thought.

The study estimates that the world’s oceans absorbed 60 percent more heat energy between 1991 and 2016 than previous estimates have suggested. Further, the study suggests, GHG emissions generate more heat than scientists originally predicted, which, the authors argue, may make it harder for the world to limit the global average temperature increases to the targets set in the Paris Agreement on climate change. In addition, the findings indicate that extra heat will go into the world’s oceans, resulting in implications for marine ecosystems.

Laure Resplandy, the Princeton University researcher who led the study, said the study finds that the planet warmed more than researchers had previously thought. “It was just hidden from us because we didn’t sample it right,” she explained. Resplandy elaborated that the study suggests that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is “even harder because we close the window for those lower pathways” outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15).

The report notes the importance of economic structural transformation for poverty eradication and long-term development in LDCs.

Titled ‘Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation: Beyond Business as Usual,’ the report defines structural transformation as the transfer of production factors, such as land, labor and capital, from activities and sectors with low productivity and value added to those with higher productivity and value added, which are different “in location and organization, as well as technologically.” The publication discusses: sustainable development, structural transformation and entrepreneurship; the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs; the local entrepreneurship dimension of global production systems; major constraints and current policy frameworks to entrepreneurship in LDCs; and policies for transformational entrepreneurship.

On the LDC entrepreneurial “landscape” the report finds, among other observations, that: self-employment in LDCs is at 70% of total employment compared with 50% across other developing countries, and is declining only slowly; innovation is limited, with an average of 15% of early entrepreneurs reporting the introduction of a new product or service, compared with 24% in other developing countries; and only 12% of early entrepreneurs have a post-secondary education compared with 36% in other developing countries, which shows a low level of educational attainment.

The report states that several structural features of LDC economies, including limited financial development, insufficient infrastructure, lack of institutional development, elevated risk levels and the disempowerment of women, tend to weaken entrepreneurship and enterprise development. It adds that limited urbanization and the disproportionate role of agriculture also have an impact on the nature of enterprises in LDCs.

In order to harness entrepreneurship for structural transformation, the report calls for: entrepreneurship policies to foster linkages between firms of different sizes, stages of maturity and sectors by means of business clusters, networking and alliances; introducing entrepreneurship education and skills development in both mainstream and specialized education programmes; and creating clusters of learning, innovation and creativity involving universities, schools, research, vocational institutes and experimental laboratories to “sustain a flow of new ideas” into firms throughout their life cycle.

LDCs are countries characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The LDC category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures were needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries.

The 47 current LDCs are Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia.

321,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-nutcracker-and-the-four-realms,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Nutcracker and the Four Realms’,"Disney’s second stab at Fantasia-themed fantasy-adventure steals from the best — and from some of the rest — but the theft never pays off.

When Disney’s fantasy-adventure The Sorcerer’s Apprentice debuted eight years ago, I was mildly appreciative that it didn’t come with a franchise-y extended moniker like (actual examples I made up at the time) The Sorcerer’s Apprentice: Oath of the Dragon Ring or The Sorcerer’s Apprentice: Nesting Dolls of Doom.

Now, for Disney’s second dip into Fantasia-themed brand management and cannibalization of its own legacy, there is The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. Oh well.

Like The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms takes a theme from a Fantasia sequence — in this case Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite, along with the ballet and the story that goes with it — and grafts it to an obligatory “Hero’s Journey” story arc constructed largely of standard-issue tropes and prefabricated parts.

Also there are Nesting Dolls of Doom in both movies, sort of, which is a connection I did not expect. Will this become a running theme? In another eight years will we be treated to a Dance of the Hours adventure in which the alligators pop out of ominous giant matryoshkas? How will they work nesting dolls into the plot for Toccata and Fugue?

I kid, of course, but there’s something genuinely depressing about seeing one of the most audacious experiments in animation history used not for actual inspiration, but as a kind of scrap heap for spare parts.

If you thought the Fantasia connection was just a coincidence and the filmmakers picked this subject just because they love ballet, think again: There’s actually a sequence where a silhouetted conductor climbs onto a dais and the orchestra is glimpsed in rows of colorful shadows.

Yet the filmmakers show no sensitivity to the historic associations of imagery and music that are now Disney canon. In one scene characters run through a forest past brightly-colored mushrooms, and you’re meant to smile with recognition, although the mushrooms never dance and don’t matter in any way. Worse, the bit of the Nutcracker Suite playing at that moment is not the Chinese Dance, but the Arab Dance, which should make you think not of dancing mushrooms but of coy harem-girl fish.

The Four Realms opens with Clara (Mackenzie Foy) triggering a Rube Goldberg mousetrap that begins with a hot air balloon and ends with a basket dropping on a conveniently placed mouse. This sequence offers a fitting metaphor for the film: a complicated mechanical assemblage over which Disney hopes audiences will beat a path to theater doors.

What tropes and prefab bits? So help me, it starts with a “Dead Mother/Wife” plot. This is not due to source material; Clara’s mother is alive and well in E.T.A. Hoffman’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which the libretto for Tchaikovsky’s ballet is based. Apparently Disney just feels compelled to kill off the mother or else they don’t know how to function.

Of course with the Dead Mother/Wife comes Disapproving Dad (Matthew Macfadyen). Dad is sad and stern and expects Clara to keep up Christmas family traditions and socialize rather than spending all her time in the attic with her Rube Goldberg devices, because it’s what’s expected.

When Clara protests that she doesn’t care about family traditions, her father retorts, “Well, you should!” This is at least potentially the most interesting exchange in the film. You could make a thoughtful family film about this question. Naturally, the filmmakers give it no more thought.

There’s also a Surprise Villain, an increasingly hackneyed Disney/Pixar device that used to be actually surprising back in the days of Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. It was no longer surprising in Toy Story 3 and Wreck-It Ralph, but the last straw for me was Hans in Frozen, who wasn’t even meant to be the villain until they decided that Let It Go was too catchy for the Snow Queen to be the villain.

These days it’s everywhere: Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Coco. It’s gotten to the point where the villain not being a surprise is a surprise.

What other tropes are there? Well, there’s Morgan Freeman, who has become a wise, mentorly trope unto himself. There is actually some excuse for this one, as Drosselmeyer, Clara’s godfather and a clockmaker and magician, does serve as a kind of gatekeeper to the magical goings-on.

In this version Drosselmeyer is also a proxy for Clara’s dead mother, whom he knew from a little girl, and who made the Fabergé-style jeweled egg that is Clara’s mother’s final Christmas present to her daughter.

The quest to unlock the egg leads Clara to the visually magical world of the Four Realms, which her mother sort of discovered and sort of created, and don’t try to make sense of it.

Each of the realms is governed by a regent: Keira Knightley’s Sugar Plum Fairy rules the Land of Sweets; Richard E. Grant’s Shiver is lord of the Land of Snowflakes; and Eugenio Derbez’s Hawthorne governs the Land of Flowers.

Then there’s the ominous Fourth Realm, where Helen Mirren’s intimidating Mother Ginger holds court. The Fourth Realm sequences include imagery far too creepy for younger kids: menacing tumbler clowns popping out of one another’s bodies; a giant mechanical doppelganger of Mother Ginger.

The Nutcracker borrows or outright plagiarizes from a variety of sources, from The Wizard of Oz and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to March of the Wooden Soldiers, Coraline and especially Alice in Wonderland — the Tim Burton version, alas, itself a mishmash of parts welded to a Hero’s Journey arc.

There’s nothing wrong with artistic borrowing, but the filmmakers just throw all of these borrowed ingredients into a heap without fashioning them into something with a character of its own.

At the center of the film’s lack of inspiration is Clara, an utterly generic heroine with no discernible personality traits, no flaws, and perforce no character arc.

We’re told that she has a unique way of looking at the world, which seems to refer to her fondness of physics and machinery. Other than some tinkering and occasional lines about the laws of physics, though, this unique way of looking at the world is never actually shown. Being interested in STEM may be an attractive quality in a protagonist, especially a heroine, but it’s not really a personality trait, is it?

I can’t believe I’m citing The Sorcerer’s Apprentice as a positive point of contrast, but this is what it’s come to: At least Jay Baruchel’s underdog hero — who also had a thing for STEM, come to think of it — had relatable anxieties and things in his life he cared about that mattered in the movie, including the girl he had liked since the third grade.

Clara cares about her dead mother, of course, but since the mother isn’t a character in this film, Clara doesn’t have a single human relationship in the movie that matters much, except her bond with her godfather Drosselmeyer, who’s only in the framing story.

Clara’s staunchest ally in the world of the Four Realms is the Nutcracker soldier, also known as Captain Philip, played by Jayden Fowora-Knight. Captain Philip is loyal and obedient to a fault, but, as he has no quest or need of his own, he’s about as engaging as Dorothy’s three companions would be if they didn’t care about brains or heart or nerve.

Perhaps the movie might have contrived to bring Clara’s father and two siblings into the Four Realms, and the movie could have become a real family adventure. Perhaps Clara could have learned that she needs her family after all — or perhaps her special way of seeing would have been highlighted.

The Four Realms is one of those movies that makes less sense the more of its secrets are revealed (vague spoilers follow). Why is the Fourth Realm the way it is? What happened to the regiment of soldiers that followed Clara into the Fourth Realm and vanished? Whose fault is that?

Did Drosselmeyer know that Clara would face potentially lethal perils in the land of the Four Realms? Was he at all concerned that she would be killed? Is Clara’s mother an inventor or a sorceress? Why does Clara think going home early would have solved anything?

In the end, going for a heartwarming denouement, Drosselmeyer smilingly tells Clara that when her mother was asked which of her creations was her greatest, she named Clara. What kind of thing is that for a mother of three to say?

Do the Tinsels

Of Tinsel-town

Like Christmas Day?

From my lair

On Mount Critic …

It’s tricky to say.

They Tinsel up holiday movies each year

But I don’t see much joy or holiday cheer.

For years now, they’ve built up a gloomulous glut

Of glum Christmas flicks. They’ve been stuck in a rut —

From R-rated dregs to Tim Allen-ish dreck

And the Jim Carrey Grinch, which is awful as heck.

The Tinsels don’t Seuss well. Their efforts fall flat,

From the unspooky Lorax to Mike in the Hat.

Only Horton was done right, kind and angelic

And Blue Sky’s Who-ville was drolly Geisel-ic.

But Ron Howard’s Who-ville was ugly and vile:

A hell in the ’burbs in true Tinsel-town style.

Shallow, promiscuous, cruel through and through.

If I’d been born there, I would be a Grinch, too.

Now we’re back in Who-ville for the Grinch’s return

With the Lorax and Minions crew — cause for concern.

While they’ve mastered the “secrets” of box-office glory

Their “despicable” debut was their last decent story.

It’s easy to see how this thing could go wrong

With Lorax-ish satire that doesn’t belong

In this tale of kind Whos who welcome a crank,

Enlarging his heart and forgiving his prank.

So I’m happy to state, though my praise may be faint-ish,

My critical heart is more pleased than complaint-ish.

The Tinsels have managed to Seuss out this one

And it’s decent, good-hearted, forgettable fun.

It’s visually playful, with gadgetry Gru-vy

Repurposed in new ways both Grinchy and Who-vy.

Especially the heist — a logistical dream

As much as a mean anti-holiday scheme.

Replacing Karloff-ian malice and spite

Cumberbatch-ian grousing makes this one Grinch-lite.

It’s a kinder and gentler tale than we’ve seen —

Of course he’s not nice, but this Grinch is less mean.

(I knew that he wasn’t as mean as he said

When he caved to his pets and let them in his bed.

And one is a reindeer as big as a moose!

This pushover’s not the guy scripted by Seuss!)

But he does still hate Christmas! The whole thing is bosh!

Except … gingerbread might be worth a nosh

And scenes of togetherness of kith and kin…

He sneers, but it’s clear he’s conflicted within.

And, you know, I’m okay with this sour-sweet sinner:

Clinging to mean … tempted by Christmas dinner.

The Whos are quite decent, I’m happy to say,

In an innocent, cheerful, Ned Flanders-ish way.

They may go a bit far with the whole Christmas thing,

But they sing for-real carols about Christ the King.

Then there’s Cindy-Lou Who, bouncy and sprightly —

A bit like young Ellie from Up, very slightly —

Determined to make contact with Santa Claus,

But her mother’s well-being is her only cause.

(Mom is single, a nurse, and works hard to get by.

It’s the third Dad-less Seuss film with no reason why.)

There are bits that don’t work, to tell you the truth,

Like glimpses of Grinchy’s unfortunate youth.

There’s hit-and-miss slapstick, and weak gags are made,

And added narration doesn’t quite make the grade.

(Pharrell Williams’ delivery falls a bit short;

Anapestic tetrameter isn’t his forte.)

But the group-hug finale sells it with feeling,

And Who-ville, though silly, is warmly appealing.

All are accepted, whatever the hue,

Or the shade, or the size, or the shape of the Who.

Even nasty outsiders, green-furred and alone

Find kindness and mercy to such as them shown.

The classic tale takes this too much as a given.

Seuss’ Grinch is converted — but is he forgiven?

When he brings the Whos’ things back down from Mount Crumpit,

Announcing himself with a literal trumpet,

Does he apologize — repent in the least?

Or merely presume of his place at the feast?

Grace is a gift, not a matter of course.

And that’s one way this movie improves on its source.

This agreement will allow for fuller measurement of several aspects of SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), as well as targets on sustainable food production, food waste, access to medicine, free primary and secondary education, market regulation, migration, sustainable urbanization, marine acidity, and organized crime, among others.

IAEG-SDGs 8 convened from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden, with one of the four days held in a closed format for IAEG members, and the other three days open to observers.

The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The framework was agreed on by the UN Statistical Commission and adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2017. The framework contains 232 indicators for measuring the 169 SDG targets.

Many of the indicators are still under development, and they are classified into three “tiers” to show their status: Tier I denotes that an indicator is both conceptually clear and available data exists for its measurement. A Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. If an indicator is classified as Tier III, it requires methodological development. Tier III indicators are not reflected in the annual SDG reports presented to the HLPF.

By the end of November 2018, following the meeting in Stockholm and subsequent discussions, the Group had agreed to reclassify the following indicators from Tier III to Tier II, reflecting agreement on the methodology for their measurement:

SDG 2 (zero hunger): Indicator 2.4.1 – Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (for Target 2.4 – Sustainable Food Production and Resilient Agricultural Practices) (target abbreviations per the Global Goals project);

SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing): Indicator 3.b.3 – Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (for Target 3.b – Support Research, Development and Universal Access to Affordable Vaccines and Medicines);

SDG 4 (quality education): Indicator 4.1.1 (a) – Proportion of children and young people in grades 2/3 (for Target 4.1 – Free Primary and Secondary Education);

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): Indicator 10.2.1 – Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 10.2 -Promote Universal Social, Economic and Political Inclusion); Indicator 10.5.1 – Financial Soundness Indicators (for Target 10.5 – Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions); Indicator 10.7.1 – Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination (for Target 10.7 – Responsible and Well-Managed Migration Policies); and Indicator 10.7.2 – Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (also for Target 10.7)

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): Indicator 11.3.2 – Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically (for Target 11.3 – Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization); and Indicator 11.7.1 – Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 11.7 – Provide Access to Safe and Inclusive Green and Public Spaces)

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): Indicator 12.3.1 (a) – Food loss index (for Target 12.3 – Halve Global Per Capita Food Waste)

SDG 14 (life below water): Indicator 14.3.1 – Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling station (for Target 14.3 – Reduce Ocean Acidification) (see SDG Knowledge Hub story on this indicator reclassification);

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): Indicator 16.4.2 – Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments (for Target 16.4 – Combat Organized Crime and Illicit Financial and Arms Flows); and Indicator 16.7.1 (a) Proportions of positions in national and local public institutions, including the legislature (for Target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making)



In addition, the Group reclassified six indicators from Tier II to Tier I, due to regular data production for these indicators. They correspond to SDG targets 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases); 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage) (2 indicators); 3.b (Support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines); 6.5 (Implement integrated water resources management) and 6.6 (Protect and restore water-related ecosystems).

For SDGs 12, 13 and 14, several indicators remain in Tier III. But for SDG 10, the reclassifications mean that only one indicator is Tier III.

As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:

Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);

Tier II: 82 indicators; and

Tier III: 44 indicators.

Six other indicators have components in different tiers.

Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III. Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;

SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; and

SDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III.

Among the remaining Tier III indicators, the following correspond to targets with a 2020 deadline:

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): Indicator 8.b.1 – Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy (for Target 8.b – By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization)

SDG 12: Indicator 12.2.1 – Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP (for Target 12.2 – By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources) Indicator 12.4.2 – Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment (for Target 12.4 – By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

SDG 13: Indicator 13.a.1 – Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment (for Target 13.a – Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible)

SDG 14: Indicator 14.2.1 – Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches (for Target 14.2 – By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans) Indicator 14.7.1 – Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries (for Target 14.7 – By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism)

SDG 15 (life on land): Indicator 15.9.1 – Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (for Target 15.9 – By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts)

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): Indicator 17.18.1 – Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (for Target 17.18 – By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts)



The Group plans to continue to reclassify indicators as requirements are met, considering them during semi-annual in-person meetings and bi-monthly teleconference meetings in between. The next tier reclassification web meetings will take place on 17 January and in early February 2019.

The next in-person IAEG meeting (March or April 2019) is expected to include the final progress review of Tier III indicators to determine whether any should be deleted. These will be included in a “preliminary list of possible deletions, replacements, adjustments and additions” for open consultation between May and July 2019 as part of the first “comprehensive review” of the global indicator framework. A list of 37 indicators under consideration for addition has been prepared.

The consultation results will be reviewed by September 2019, and a final proposal will be prepared for consideration by the UN Statistical Commission at its 51st meeting in March 2020. More details on the timeline of the comprehensive review are available here.

IAEG members stressed during the Stockholm meeting that the review should not lead to an additional burden on national statistical work, nor undermine the investments already made in national statistical systems.

The meeting also discussed: a minimum level of data disaggregation for each target and indicator; two proposed proxy indicators (for 11.a.1 and 12.b.1); and the draft guidelines on data flows and global data reporting.

326,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

327,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/behavioral-and-cognitive-approaches-to-biodiversity-conservation/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches to Biodiversity Conservation,"It was quite intriguing to read an article that explains how a sign that sought to promote awareness in conservation, had in fact worked against conservation. A sign was put up in a peatland forest in Arizona, US, to deter people from stealing from the forest. It read as follows: “Many past visitors have removed petrified wood from this park, destroying the natural state of the petrified forest.” Months later, when a review was done on the impact of this sign and pilferage from the forest, researchers were astonished to find that stealing had tripled.

A behavioral science perspective on how people perceived the sign suggests that people must have thought that “since others have done it, it is alright to continue doing so.” This is a startling finding for a conservation expert who never thought of this angle in conservation.

Let me give you another example. A recent World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report cites a 60 percent loss of biodiversity globally since 1970 in spite of billions of dollars spent on conservation and dozens of global political commitments. For the common man on the street, the message is simple: we have lost 60 percent of biodiversity but I am not feeling any immediate impacts. My needs are still met, I am wealthier, consume better and invest in issues of my choice. There is no great famine, no large death toll, no economic downturn that I can see in front of my eyes.

I know this is a provocative statement to make but this is more or less what is happening in our conversations about conservation. In a book titled, ‘The Death of Environmentalism,’ the author states that the word “warming” in “global warming” “feels good” for some people. Similarly, in conservation, declining biodiversity is still not seen as a threat to our survival by non-conservationists, including the general public.

My recent research into cognitive and behavioral thinking led to me to look for uncommon answers to the way we are communicating about conservation and its importance. A few thousand delegates who convene once every two years to have heated discussions on why we are losing in our actions to protect biodiversity and what we can do to improve the situation has not helped us in the recent decades.

Looking at cognitive science, I came across an interesting set of experiences from the advertising industry on how the industry captures people’s attention and imagination to push their agenda. Two specific examples are of relevance to how we advance the biodiversity agenda using cognition: social proofing; and communicating impacts of our actions.

Social Proofing Our Message

In an article published in the Wall Street Journal on turning consumers green, the author notes that there was more response to the sign that said neighbors are actively using the options to go green than to those that mention how much money one can save, how responsible one could be towards the environment or to what extent this is a moral obligation.

Reported progress on biodiversity conservation and climate change suggests that few are aware of this. Having reviewed all the national reports to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted by States until 2018, it is clear that almost all of them address what governments are doing for conservation but there is very little information on what others, including civil society, business community, UN agencies and academic institutions, are contributing. This is a major disconnect, which disincentivizes people from partnering in conservation. Few environment ministries’ web portals, united in the network of national Clearing-House Mechanisms, highlight successes of these stakeholders.

For the post-2020 biodiversity framework, we need to social proof the strategic plan and targets. Merely reporting that these are developed in a participatory manner through a few workshops and consultations will not do.

Communicating Impacts of Our Actions

We all know that in spite of all our efforts the environment is getting from bad to worse. All the investments are yet to give us impactful results, and we are struggling to make the “big breakthrough.” In this context, it is important to be cautious with our messages about challenges and failures.

It is alright to admit to failures, but environmental managers need to ensure that the message is communicated in a manner that clarifies the reasons for failure better. Additionally, the more the common man feels the guilt for their own actions, the better the chances for behavioral change. This, however, would require workable solutions.

Take the example of a 1962 advertisement by David & Goliath for the car rental company Avis that was far behind Hertz in brand popularity. It stated: “When you’re only number two you try harder. Or Else.” The advertisement increased Avis’s annual profit by US$1.2 million in a decade, and the company ran it for 50 years.

Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches in the Post-2020 Framework and 2030 Agenda

The 2010 Biodiversity Target was met only partially, and there are indications that the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be achieved in their entirety. At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Beijing, China, governments will face the challenging task of upholding people’s confidence in multilateral approaches to and national actions on saving biodiversity.

Conservation could benefit from cognitive and behavioral approaches now more than ever before. These approaches could help achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as well as SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 14 (life below water). This is the main message from a side event FLEDGE organized during the CBD COP 14 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The examples and approaches outlined in this article resonated with many countries who suggested actions towards behavioral change. It is our hope that countries will explore these options further as we develop the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

328,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

329,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-promotes-technological-developments-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Promotes Technological Developments for SDGs,"7 December 2018: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution asking key UN bodies for updated findings on the impact of key technological changes vis-a-vis the 2030 Agenda, for discussion at the fourth annual UN Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum). The UN also recently announced that over half the world is using the internet, held a high-level briefing on frontier technologies for sustainable development, and convened a forum on internet governance.

In June 2018, the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), presented initial findings on ways in which technology can support the SDGs, during the third STI Forum. The UNGA resolution adopted on 22 November 2018 (A/RES/73/17) requests the two bodies to update their findings, invites them to strengthen their synergies and mutually reinforce their work on STI, and requests the Secretariat to avoid overlapping meeting dates to further increase coherence. The fourth STI Forum will take place from 14-15 May 2019. Looking ahead to the UNGA’s 74th session, the resolution also invites the UNGA President to convene a high-level thematic debate to take stock of progress on the topic.

Presenting the draft resolution, Juan José Gómez Camacho, Mexico, said new technologies “can change the destinies of nations.” He called for the consideration of technological change in the next follow-up and review cycle on SDG implementation, given the opportunities presented by new technologies, as well as the fact that their impacts will depend on governments’ ability “to come together and cooperate on realizing a global vision.”

On 7 December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) announced that more than half of the world’s population will be using the internet at 2018’s end. ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao noted that the milestone “represents an important step towards a more inclusive global information society.” Despite ITU highlighting that 96% of global society now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, Zhao underscored that many are still waiting to experience the gains associated with internet access or a digital economy. With near-global coverage and the fastest rates of growth taking place in Africa, the impact of the internet on society is only expected to increase.

AI algorithms must shed human biases, participants stressed at the 2018 Internet Governance Forum.

In November, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brought together more than 3,000 participants at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on the theme ‘Internet of Trust.’ Key messages are available on the Forum’s eight major topics:

Cybersecurity, Trust & Privacy;

Development, Innovation & Economic Issues;

Digital Inclusion & Accessibility;

Emerging Technologies;

Evolution of Internet Governance;

Human Rights, Gender & Youth;

Media & Content; and

Technical & Operational Topics.

The Chair’s Summary underscores the cross-cutting nature of new technologies, noting that governance of the internet must be both multistakeholder and multidisciplinary to ensure that systems do not discriminate and that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms shed human biases. [UN Press Release] [IGF Homepage]

The IGF is convened annually by the UN Secretary-General, and this year, was hosted by the Government of France. In his remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron launched the ‘Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described opportunities afforded by the digital world, but also advised vigilance. Recognizing that traditional forms of regulation do not necessarily apply to the new challenges that have accompanied the digital era, Guterres noted the emergence of potential issues around cybersecurity, data and instances of “the Internet being used as a platform for hate speech, for repression, censorship, and control.” Guterres emphasized the need to create a shared language, calling for a dedicated effort to include and amplify weak or missing voices.

Next year’s IGF will be hosted by the Government of Germany. An advisory group containing 52 members has been appointed to lead preparations. [UN News Release]

Also in November, the World Web Summit 2018 took place in Lisbon, Portugal, bringing together approximately 70,000 attendees. The 24 discussion tracks ranged from autonomous vehicles to cryptocurrencies to health. Guterres described the web as having the potential to turbocharge the world’s progress towards the SDGs, saying the UN itself is utilizing technologies to enhance impacts and achieve its goals. He also raised concerns on uneven social impacts, the spread of hate speech as noted at the IGF, and the weaponization of artificial intelligence.

An event titled ‘High-level Briefing on Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development: Findings from the World Economic and Social Survey 2018’ took place on 1 November 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Moderated by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, the event reviewed findings from the 2018 survey, a common message of which is that “technology is neither exogenous nor neutral,” meaning that societal needs and policy prerogatives must guide the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies. The survey and event highlighted national-level policy measures that can maximize technologies’ potential while mitigating risks, taking economic efficiency, equity and ethical considerations into account.

330,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

331,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-votes-to-adopt-global-compact-on-refugees/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Votes to Adopt Global Compact on Refugees,"17 December 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted the Global Compact on Refugees, following a consultation process including a series of thematic discussions and meetings in 2017, and formal consultations on successive drafts between February and July 2018. UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés noted that the adoption of the Compact marks the beginning, not the end, of the international community’s work to respond comprehensively “to the challenges that face refugees and their hosts.”

The Global Compact on Refugees was called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which also called for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The latter was adopted by 164 governments in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10 December 2018, and is scheduled to be formally endorsed on 19 December 2018, in the UNGA Hall in New York, US.

The refugee compact, while not legally binding, seeks to strengthen the international response to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations, and to better define cooperation to share responsibilities. It builds on existing international law and standards, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and human rights treaties. The Compact comprises four parts: i) an introduction setting out the background, guiding principles and objectives of the compact; ii) the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), as agreed to by UN Member States in Annex I of the New York Declaration; iii) a Programme of Action setting out concrete measures to help meet the objectives of the Compact; and iv) arrangements for follow-up and review.

The Compact was presented to the UNGA in September 2018 as part of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ 2018 annual report, and was then discussed during a high-level ministerial event hosted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On 17 December 2018, the UNGA considered the Global Compact on Refugees as part of a resolution on the Office of the UNHCR, which was adopted with 181 votes in favor, two against and three abstentions.

In a media stakeout following the Compact’s adoption, Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, clarified that the US and Hungary had opposed the UNGA resolution containing the Compact. However, he added that in 2018 UNHCR received the highest contribution ever from the US. The three governments abstaining from the vote were Eritrea, Liberia and Libya.

Also on 17 December, following the UNGA meeting to adopt the Compact, UNHCR hosted an event to mark the agreement. Espinosa said that through this agreement, the UNGA demonstrates its efficacy and utility, and cements its role as the ‘Parliament of Humanity.’ She added that low and middle-income countries host over 80% of all refugees.

The refugee compact contains four elements of particular importance for achieving the SDGs, including measures to ease pressures on host countries.

Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General, on behalf of the UN Secretary-General, outlined four elements of the Compact that are particularly important for achieving the SDGs. She noted that the Compact: i) sets out concrete measures to share the responsibility and ease the pressure on the small number of countries that host the majority of refugees; ii) seeks to bring humanitarian and development action closer together, building on the UN Secretary-General’s reform of the UN development system; iii) provides ways to create jobs and livelihoods, and recognizes that refugees and host communities themselves must be at the center of decision-making on refugee issues; and iv) calls on the international community as a whole to take broader initiatives to prevent conflict and build sustained peace.

Grandi noted that it was the first time there was such a concerted effort to reach an agreement on refugees at the UNGA. He reported that 15 countries have rolled out the Compact’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which he said has mobilized US$6.5 billion that would have not been accessible through traditional finances.

On next steps, Grandi highlighted that the Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, to take stock of the Compact’s commitments and achievements. He noted the need to plan for this event.

Via video messages, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Foreign Minister of Turkey, said the international community has not done enough to help refugees, and should also strengthen support to host countries and communities. Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stressed the importance of shared responsibility and partnerships to respond to the refugee crisis, adding that the EU and its member States comprise the largest donor worldwide.

Bertine Bahige, a Congolese refugee resettled in the US, remarked that all refugees are looking for hope, and are victims of circumstances they have not chosen. Talking about his experience spending five years in a refugee camp in Mozambique, he said he had felt safe and was given access to resources, but wished he could have had access to education and given the possibility to start building his life.

332,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-spotlight-on-green-growth-and-investment-in-africa/,"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Spotlight on Green Growth and Investment in Africa,"As Isaiah Esipisu laments in an article on IPS News, African media was “poorly represented” at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, which closed in the wee hours of Sunday, 16 December. As a contribution to correcting this shortcoming, this issue of SDG Knowledge Weekly focuses on the newsworthy, Africa-related events that took place and knowledge products that were released around the COP.

The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) previewed findings from a joint assessment of Africa’s “Green Growth Readiness” at a COP 24 side event on 10 December 2018. Through case studies from Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia, the assessment covers: the current state of green growth in Africa; readiness to promote green growth in the context of SDG implementation; and roles of development partners (including AfDB and GGGI) in promoting green growth in the context of implementing the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. An IPS News article reports that the study found urgent needs around finance, as well as the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth.

Also on green growth, the Government of Rwanda hosted the inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum, which took place in Kigali, from 26-30 November 2018, under the theme: ‘For a green and climate resilient Africa.’ The agenda highlights the timing of the Forum just prior to COP 24, noting that the discussions will serve as an input to the discussions in Poland. Among the many speeches and presentations available, Anthony Nyong, AfDB, highlights investing in green growth in Africa. Among other topics, he describes AfDB tools and investment opportunities in the agriculture and energy sectors, barriers to adoption of green growth technologies, and lessons learned at country level.

A regional NDC hub for African countries was launched “to engage national, sub-national, non-state actors and private sector representatives on appropriate policies, strategies and actions tailored to suit individual needs of African countries to enable them deliver their climate change commitments.” The Hub, which AfDB established in November 2017, focuses on three main areas: long-term climate action; mobilizing means of implementation; and coordination, advocacy and partnerships.

An AfDB brochure summarizes the Hub’s purposes, goals and intended outcomes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities, barriers to success and financial needs for fully realizing countries’ NDC targets, laying out a roadmap for achievement. In support of these objectives, AfDB and partners held discussions at COP 24 on encouraging cooperation across regional NDC hubs and operationalizing NDCs in Africa. A compilation of AfDB publications released prior to and in the margins of COP 24 is available here.

Many African countries “already live the future” of a two degrees warmer planet.

Despite progress on NDC implementation, a second article by Isaiah Esipisu on IPS News notes that many African countries “already live the future” of a scenario where the planet has warmed by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Responding to questions by Esipisu, Gernot Laganda, World Food Programme (WFP), stresses that climate change is already affecting food security, noting that the number of hungry people is increasing and extreme weather events continually drag people back into poverty. Agriculture-based economies, such as those in Africa, feel the effects of climate change most acutely, he explains, adding that one consequence of climate change is migration, which “is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism.”

Echoing Laganda’s point on migration, Gilbert Houngbo, President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasizes the need to “invest in Africa’s youth before migration to Europe doubles,” as reported by Hannah Summers in The Guardian. Houngbo flags the importance of investment in sustainable farming on the continent, but acknowledges that more is needed: “priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare.” He also describes access to modern technology as being essential for young people and outlines the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment in rural areas. All are key to ensuring food security and profitability of smallholder farms, which can stem migration flows.

The key, as highlighted by Houngbo above, is investment. The Brookings Institution’s Landry Signé and Witney Schneidman reflect on the inaugural Africa Investment Forum, held from 7-9 November 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Forum, they note, was convened with the aim of “unlocking Africa’s investment potential by facilitating onsite transactions.” While the Forum previewed over 230 projects across 15 sectors and announced investment interest in 49 projects worth US$38.7 billion, Signé and Schneidman note that lower business costs through better business regulations and special economic zones are needed, lest the deals face challenges to implementation and long-term sustainability.

The African Economic Conference was held from 3-5 December 2018, in Kigali, Rwanda. Convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the conference took place on the theme ‘regional and continental integration for Africa’s development,’ building on the March 2018 commitment of 44 African countries to a common market for Africa, known as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the earlier launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016. Supporting papers cover information and communications technology (ICT), economic integration’s impacts on the environment, regional integration versus bilateral diplomacy, food security, gender equality and energy, among other topics. Numerous UNECA press releases on these subjects are also available.

During the conference, UNECA launched the 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report, which tracks the continent’s progress towards both the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063. The report aligns with the theme of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)— “transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies”—focusing on the five SDGs reviewed: 6 (clean water and sanitation); 7 (affordable and clean energy); 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 15 (life on land). A detailed write-up on the report’s findings against each Goal is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Finally, the Intra-African Trade Fair 2018 was held 11-17 December 2018, in Cairo, Egypt. Hosted by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the Fair aimed to bring African businesses together to share information and explore opportunities on the continent. The Afreximbank convened the Fair in part due to low rates of trade within Africa, attributed in part to lack of access to trade and market information.

The conference, hosted by the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), also considered the 2018 Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Italy’s SDG Cities Index report.

The Conference on local leadership for sustainability (‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: la leadership locale come motore dello sviluppo’) took place on 29 November 2019, at FEEM, SDSN Italy’s host institution, in Milan, Italy.

Italy’s SDG Cities Index report seeks to guide local policymakers in further aligning municipal initiatives with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Presenting the report, Laura Cavalli, FEEM and SDSN Italy, remarked that about 75% of Italy’s population lives in urban areas, and that the Index could serve as an analytical planning tool for cities to encourage reflection on ways to address population growth and achieve the SDGs, according to the summary of the event.

The report titled, ‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: l’SDSN Italia SDGs City Index 2018,’ currently available in Italian, examines SDG implementation in Italy’s municipalities. It features indicators specific to the Italian context, which can be used to monitor and measure SDG progress at the sub-national level. It examines 101 municipalities on 16 of the 17 SDGs, using 39 statistical indicators. The Index excludes SDG 14 (life below water) for comparability reasons.

Per the summary of the conference, the report finds that Italian cities have achieved approximately 53% of the SDG targets. Out of the 101 cities analyzed, none has “reached more than 80 per cent of overall achievement” on the SDGs.

The Italian SDG City Index was initially presented during a two-week festival on sustainable development organized by the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile – ASviS) and other stakeholders, from 25 May to 7 June 2018, which took place across Italy.

The ‘Call to Action’ was issued during the closing session of the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue on 12 December during the Katowice Climate Change Conference, which is meeting in Poland from 2-14 December. It was delivered by youth champions Timoci Naulusala, Fiji, and Hanna Wojdowska, Poland, and captures a series of “calls” directed at governments, international agencies, non-Party stakeholders, civil society, spiritual leaders and youth, with the aim of fostering greater political will and action, including through enhancing financial, technical and technological cooperation and capacity building.

The Call to Action represents the outcome of a year-long process that saw governments and other stakeholders discuss, in an informal setting, climate policy and ways to increase ambition and actions. It captures “key messages emerging from the Talanoa Dialogue and synthesis report” to governments as they begin to update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and prepare long-term climate strategies, which are to be submitted by 2020. These key messages are:

We must fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement;

We must achieve a just transformation towards a better world;

We must unlock the full potential of technology;

We must demonstrate bold leadership; and

We must act together.

During the concluding Dialogue session, COP 24 President Michal Kurtyka noted the close alignment of the Dialogue and the main negotiations at COP 24 on the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement, which both address paths that countries will follow in efforts to ramp up climate actions.

Talanoa Dialogue must now also give way to the Talanoa Call for Action.

COP 23 President and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, said the “Talanoa Dialogue must now also give way to the Talanoa Call for Action,” emphasizing the need to increase ambition and action five-fold to achieve the 1.5°C target, and exchange ideas and best practices to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Kurtyka and Bainimarama invited all stakeholders, including the general public, to join the Talanoa Call for Action.

The concluding Dialogue plenary followed 21 ministerial roundtables, held on 11 December, during which nearly 100 ministers and over 40 non-Party stakeholders convened to discuss ways to advance global climate action.

The Talanoa Dialogue, based on a Fijian traditional way of conversing to tackle collective issues, gathered views on three guiding questions: Where we are? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there? It aimed to take stock of global efforts since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and inform the preparation of NDCs.

A single-year record of approximately US$129 million was committed by nine contributor Governments, including two first-time contributors, exceeding the Fund’s previous record of US$95.9 million set in 2017.

During the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue on 11 December, co-hosted by the German and Swedish Governments, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, two regions in Belgium, and first-time contributors New Zealand and the European Commission announced their pledges. Germany made a 70 million Euros pledge, the largest single donation to the Fund ever.

Sweden’s objective is to make the Adaptation Fund an integral part of the Paris Agreement’s financial architecture.

Welcoming the pledges and highlighting the high demand for the Fund, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said a record US$264 million in project requests was received for the last Adaptation Fund Board meeting alone. Expressing gratitude for the contributions, Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) Chair Victor Viñas said the Fund pioneered ‘Direct Access,’ an innovative climate finance modality, which helps build national capacities and fosters country ownership in adaptation. Karolina Skog, Minister for the Environment, Sweden, said her country’s objective is to make the Adaptation Fund an integral part of the financial architecture of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and commended efforts to mainstream gender into project design and implementation.

Projects funded by the Adaptation Fund and highlighted during the Dialogue include: in Rwanda, terracing, afforestation and de-silting caves, which restored flooded farmlands to vulnerable communities; in Jamaica, empowering agricultural communities through water and land management through a Direct Access project; and, in South Africa, reducing flood and drought risks among 25,000 people and enhancing resilience in local farmers.

Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$532 million to 80 adaptation projects in vulnerable communities in developing countries, serving 5.8 million direct beneficiaries.

336,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/fashion-industry-launches-charter-for-climate-action-at-cop-24/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Fashion Industry Launches Charter for Climate Action at COP 24,"10 December 2018: At the Katowice Climate Change Conference, the global fashion sector launched an industry charter that aims to address the fashion sector’s climate impact across its entire value chain. The charter recognizes the fashion industry’s role as both a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and as a sector with opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while contributing to sustainable development.

Forty-three fashion leaders representing fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, a major shipping company and others committed to addressing climate change through the ‘Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,’ which complements and supports other fashion industry initiatives aimed at increasing climate action. The Charter aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and presents a vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition, the Charter sets an initial target for the industry to reduce their aggregate GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, including through phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their companies and direct suppliers beginning in 2025.

In the Charter, CEOs and presidents of fashion organizations commit to support the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and increase their collaboration within and beyond the fashion sectors towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The Charter commits signatories to analyze and set a decarbonization pathway for the fashion industry, building on methodologies from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and by developing a work programme and tools necessary to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets. Signatories further commit to, inter alia: quantify, track and publicly report on GHG emissions; prioritize materials with low-climate impact without negatively affecting other sustainability aspects; and pursue energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in fashion value chains. Signatories also commit to: support a global transition to low-carbon transport by giving preference to low-carbon logistics; support the movement towards circular business models; and establish a closer dialogue with consumers to increase awareness about the GHG emissions caused in use and end-of-life phases of products, to build towards changed consumer behaviors that reduce environmental impacts and extend the useful life of products.

The Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work.

The Charter developed out of efforts by fashion leaders to shape a climate movement, which was chaired by PUMA SE and H&M Group. PUMA CEO Bjørn Gulden said shared supply chains generate over 90 percent of PUMA’s carbon footprint. He stressed that if PUMA wants to reduce carbon emissions in its supply chain, the company must “work together with our industry peers.” He welcomed the Charter’s collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, and called on other industry peers to join the initiative. H&M Group CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said the Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work, emphasizing that “only together” can the industry “create the change that is urgently needed.” He said H&M supports the Charter as part of the Group’s “ambition to become climate positive in our value chain.”

UNFCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa observed that the fashion industry “is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture” and is now also “leading the way in terms of climate action.” She welcomed the Charter, expressing hope that it will set an example for others to follow.

To ensure concrete progress on the Charter’s commitments, the Charter establishes seven working groups in which signatories will work to define next steps for implementation. The working groups are: decarbonization pathway and GHG emission reductions; raw material; manufacturing/energy; logistics; policy engagement; leveraging existing tools and initiatives; and promoting broader climate action. The UNFCCC is expected to convene the working groups in early 2019, and will play a role in tracking industry progress towards the Charter. The Charter is open for other companies and organizations to join.

By aligning short- and medium-term needs for adaptation and mitigation measures with resources and support from 18 NDC Partnership members through existing and planned projects, the plan seeks to fast track climate action.

The Partnership Plan addresses short-term priority needs set by the government for implementation of its long-term 2020-2025 NDC Roadmap, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring framework on low-carbon and resilient development that details sector-specific priorities that was developed through local and national level consultations. The Plan covers agriculture, civil aviation, energy, early warning systems, forestry, health, transport, urban mobility, waste and water.

The Partnership Plan focuses on:

development of pipelines of bankable climate change-related projects;

resource mobilization and project financing;

strengthening institutional coordination;

strengthening regulatory and institutional environments;

capacity enhancement for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors;

monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems and data management;

budget coding and tracking systems; and

private sector engagement.

Mozambique based its current NDC on its National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy 2013-2030, which seeks to increase community and economic resilience, and promote low-carbon development through integrating adaptation and mitigation into sectoral and local planning. The government has committed to reduce about 76.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 eq) from 2020 to 2030, conditional on the provision of support from the international community.

The Plan was developed in consultation with 21 government ministries and institutions and 18 NDC Partnership members, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Governments of Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the US, the European Commission (EC), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI), among others.

338,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/afforestation-increases-water-supply-but-only-with-these-considerations/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Afforestation Increases Water Supply – But Only with These Considerations,"With increasing needs for water and food security and rapid urbanisation resulting from a booming global population, forests maintenance and development face great competition with other priorities. While we are losing forest resources at a high rate globally, afforestation efforts are made in some regions to offset this adverse effect.

Afforestation is the preferred measure for policymakers to solve a range of ecological problems, as it is generally believed that forests help to improve soil health and quality, reverse land degradation, halt land desertification, and provide clean water through an intensified water cycle. Especially within the context of SDG 15 (life on land), does afforestation always have a positive effect? The answer is ‘no,’ at least not always for water provision. A study of the relationship between afforestation and water supply in several regions under different climate conditions shows afforestation resulted in a decline in water supply in all climates (see Table 1).

These outcomes contradict the common belief that afforestation increases water supply. A critical driving process of these results is evapotranspiration, which is a key hydrological process in the water cycle. When lands are converted from other land uses to forests, the partitioning of precipitation into green (part of water available for plant use) and blue (part of water available for human use) water fluxes changes.

Evapotranspiration is a major green water flux, while river discharge and groundwater are typical blue water fluxes. Tree growth can consume more water than other shorter vegetation. According to the mass balance principle, if more water is used by trees, less water will flow into rivers and lakes or recharge the groundwater that people can directly use. The direct impact on water supply is becoming an increasingly urgent issue for water resource managers and planners as demands for water continue to rise.

How then can a positive effect of afforestation on water supply be achieved? We need to consider three central aspects.

First, scale matters: afforestation can accelerate the water cycle and movement at the global level. For example, more than 2 square kilometers of forest expansion can increase the possibility of rainfall. Trees transport water to the air, and water vapour moves to another place which can be geographically far from the afforested location, such as to another country or even continent through wind-driven circulation. This increases the possibility of precipitation in another location and thus contributes to the water supply in that other region. This indicates that, at a global scale, afforestation can indeed bring benefits to the water cycle.

Second, species matters: we must choose suitable tree species for afforestation to have a positive effect on the local water supply. Depending on the species, plantation forests may have different structure and amounts of water consumption (Schwärzel et al. 2018). Tree water use also declines with age. Over time, runoff reduction trends can be reversed, and water supply can be improved. Evidence shows, for example, that water supply may start to improve after 30 years in the case of pines and 15 years in the case of eucalypts (Scott and Prinsloo 2008).

Third, site matters: we need to establish forests in the right place. In dryland, less water is available from precipitation. As tree cover increases, the amount of water available is likely to become less and less, which is critical for areas that already suffer from water shortage and have high demand and competition for water (Zhang and Schwärzel 2017). Compared to dry-prone climates, water is not a limiting factor in tropical climate due to high precipitation. The decline in water supply resulting from afforestation is likely less critical and might even be negligible.

At the global level, many afforestation efforts are ongoing. There are, among others, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) in China, National Afforestation and Reforestation Plan (PNFR) in Ecuador, and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) in India. In Nigeria, afforestation is considered as a promising solution to achieve climate change mitigation and to solve water supply issues (Olorunfemi et al. 2016).

Nigeria recognises the importance of keeping their forests. The Nigerian savannah has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 16°C to 37°C and an annual rainfall about 1,220 milimeters. Afforestation in this region could induce more precipitation, and water availability could potentially increase in the long term. However, we should also recognise that there are risks for water supply in the short term.

Forests – when managed properly – can increase resilience of water supply to enable adaptation to global change. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) recently published a global assessment report highlighting that all of the SDGs are either directly or indirectly related to water and the forest-water nexus. Scientific insights on the forest-water nexus are particularly important to manage and optimize the trade-offs. Afforestation does not always have positive effects on the water supply. The seasonal and annual water yield from forested areas largely depends on forest management, covering selection of tree species, forest structure, and density.

Understanding the interlinkages and feedback loops – as advocated by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) via the Nexus Approach – will support more effective and integrated policymaking, and represents an important contribution towards achieving the SDGs.

The 2018 assessment finds that ocean health is relatively stable but additional improvements are needed to achieve a sustainable future.

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and Conservation International developed the OHI to analyze the benefits people derive from the ocean. OHI draws on information from over 100 global datasets to analyze ecological, economic, physical and social dimensions of the ocean’s health and evaluate the benefits that oceans provide to people.

Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health.

The 2018 OHI finds the average score of our ocean’s health is 70 out of 100. The OHI tracks changes in ocean health over time. In 2017, nearly two-thirds of assessed countries experienced decreases in ocean health. In 2018, 111 countries experienced decreases and 109 countries experienced increases in ocean health. Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health. Germany was the only country in the top 17 scorers with a population over one million people. Countries that scored 50 or below included seven countries in Africa, one in Central America and two Middle Eastern nations.

NCEAS Director and OHI lead scientist, Ben Halpern, said the assessment provides an annual comprehensive diagnostic for the world’s oceans that supplies decision makers with information and knowledge to “implement effective actions for improved sustainable ocean management.” Halpern stressed that the OHI’s seven years of data has enabled “deeper insights into how healthy our oceans are through time and space.”

Also on ocean health, Esri announced a partnership with the OHI to produce an online tool titled, ‘Ocean Health Hubs,’ which will enable ocean managers to use data to better understand regional ocean health. Through the partnership, Esri and OHI have integrated OHI scores as a data layer in Esri’s ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World.

OHI Director, Eva Schemmel, explained that Ocean Health Hubs “will streamline data management, target setting and communication into one tool” that multiple collaborators can access and update. By enabling government agencies, scientists, managers, non-governmental organization (NGO) staff and citizens to use the hub together, Schemmel said engagement can be “more efficient and effective.” [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on OHI Assessment] [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on Partnership] [OHI Website]","4 December 2018: The Ocean Health Index (OHI) released its seventh assessment of global ocean health.

said excluding the CDM from the response to climate change would send a negative signal to the private sector and erode investor confidence in any future carbon mechanism;

credited the CDM with increasing political will that enabled the creation of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS);

said the CDM had delivered such co-benefits as improved indoor air quality and health benefits from efficient cookstove projects, job creation, increased access to electricity, and access to clean water;

emphasized the need for “something like the CDM” to stimulate and provide incentives for investment in emission reductions; and

highlighted CDM successes in Colombia and Brazil.

Participants also emphasized that not finding a place for the CDM in the new climate regime will mean lost infrastructure, with one noting that countries can use already existing capacity, or “we’ll have to create it all again in a few years.” The event discussed the report titled, ‘Achievements of the Clean Development Mechanism: Harnessing Incentive for Climate Action,’ which was published by the CDM Executive Board (EB) in August 2018 to mark the EB’s 100th meeting.

The Framework, which was established to reduce the emissions of sports operations and to engage sports fans in the effort as well, was launched during an event on the sidelines of the Katowice Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 2-14 December 2018 in Poland.

The sports industry produces emissions through, inter alia, travel, energy use, venue construction and catering. As such, sports organizations recognize that they have an active role to play in realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, climate neutrality by 2050, and the SDGs.

The Framework aims to: achieve a clear trajectory for the global sports community to combat climate change; and use sports as a unifying tool to drive climate awareness and action. The initiative includes such signatories as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), International Sailing Federation, World Surf League and Forest Green Rovers Football Club.

Sports organizations recognize that they have an active role to play in realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, climate neutrality by 2050, and the SDGs.

The Framework elaborates five principles, namely:

undertaking systematic efforts to promote greater environmental responsibility;

reducing overall climate impact;

educating for climate action;

promoting sustainable and responsible consumption; and

advocating for climate action through communication.

Those participating in the initiative have committed to: adhere to these principles; incorporate them into strategies, policies and procedures; and mainstream them within the sports community. In early 2019, participants will be invited to establish working groups to plan, pursue and enhance work related to the Framework’s principles.

The Framework will provide sports organizations with a forum where participants can pursue climate action in a mutually supportive manner by learning from each other, disseminating good practices and lessons learned, developing new tools, and collaborating on areas of mutual interest.

The UNFCCC will use its platforms, such as Climate Neutral Now and Momentum for Change, to track progress and/or highlight successes, and will facilitate and coordinate the initiative within its resources and mandates.

The event also saw the launch of a climate action guide, ‘Sustainability Essentials: Sports for Climate Action,’ for use by sports federations, which was produced by the IOC and the UNFCCC. The IOC also released ‘Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games,’ which details guidance for Olympic Organizing Committees on measuring the carbon footprint of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The policy brief is based on findings from the NDC-SDG Connections Tool, developed by the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and SEI, which analyzes connections between climate change and the SDGs by identifying synergies. The tool derives activities from countries’ NDCs into categories of climate action, and links these with SDG targets.

The complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes.

The authors identify SDG themes with the strongest climate synergies such as energy, agriculture, water, resilience, resource efficiency, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and infrastructure. The document notes that different ministerial departments are responsible for implementing the NDCs and SDGs, and highlights that “too often they work in silos, and the complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes of decision-making.”

The authors note that new approaches at the global, national and sub-national levels that integrate horizontal and vertical decision making and increase policy coherence are essential to avoid implementation inefficiencies and to assist in achieving desired outcomes.

The brief highlights trade-offs and gaps between climate action and sustainable development arising from implementation, which include trade-offs in the global stocktake (GST) process under the Paris Agreement on climate change and financing processes. To minimize trade-offs, the authors recommend that countries that have not yet embarked on implementing the SDGs design their future national sustainable development strategies in a way that takes account of and complements their existing NDCs by focusing on issues that have not been addressed in them. They also recommend that countries take into account existing national sustainable development strategies and their synergistic potential in their future NDCs.

The reforms to the RC system are part of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ efforts to align the UN development system with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.



During its 72nd session, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) agreed on a new funding scheme for the RC system, which will require a total investment of $US281 million in 2019. The reform of the RC system entails delinking it from the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and aims to create a system that is fully dedicated to the 2030 Agenda and independent from any UN agency, while being more transparent and more accountable to Member States.

The Fifth Committee met on 28 November 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Chandramouli Ramanathan, Acting Controller, introduced the Secretary‑General’s report on the matter, noting that the UNGA had decided to double the amount contributed to the RC system through the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG’s) cost‑sharing arrangements. This arrangement, which is one of three overall funding sources for the RC system, will amount to US$77.5 million for 2019. The UN Secretariat’s share is $13.57 million.

In the ensuing discussion, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that as the UN reconfigures the RC system, transparency and accountability to governments are essential, given that the UN development system relies “heavily” on the RC system to fulfill the mandates of intergovernmentally agreed outcomes related to sustainable development. Pakistan said poverty eradication should remain UN development system’s overarching goal.

China stressed that the new RC system should not compete with UN’s existing resources. The Philippines said the funding arrangement for the RC system must address the decline of core contributions while putting no additional burdens on programme countries.

Switzerland also for Liechtenstein emphasized that the Secretary‑General must provide full transparency to all stakeholders on the system’s expenditures, total costs of operations and results achieved. She commended the Secretary‑General for proposing relevant mechanisms to that end, including a dedicated website for Member States and partners.

On 14 November, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner updated Member States on preparations to ensure the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019. Among his updates, he noted that the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) has been transitioned to the Secretariat, and outlined the process of transitioning the current RCs to the new arrangements.

The MDBs issued a declaration at the start of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

The nine MDBs are the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), the New Development Bank (NDB) and the World Bank.

This commitment builds on a December 2017 commitment by the MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC), in which the MDBs and IDFC pledged to align financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, including to support the ‘Five Voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action with Financial Institutions.’ The MDBs commitment goes beyond specific MDBs’ 2020 and 2030 climate finance targets, and builds on their ongoing contribution to climate finance, which amounted to US$35 billion in developing and emerging economies in 2017.

There is an urgent need to ensure that financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low emission and climate-resilient development.

In the declaration, the MDBs stress international consensus “on the urgent need to ensure that policy engagements and financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-resilient development.” To realize this vision, the MDBs are developing a dedicated approach that will focus on six building blocks identified as the core areas for alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. These areas are: 1) alignment with mitigation goals to ensure MDB operations are consistent with countries’ low-emission development pathways and the Paris Agreements’ mitigation objectives; 2) adaptation and climate-resilient operations, such as actively managing physical climate change risks in a manner consistent with climate-resilient development and increasing clients’ and their communities’ ability to adapt to adverse climate impacts; 3) acceleration of the transition through climate finance, by further scaling up climate finance and operationalizing new approaches to bridge the climate finance gap and accelerate support to countries in achieving their nationally determined contributions (NDCs); 4) engagement and policy development support for countries and other clients to accelerate the transition to low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways; 5) an emphasis on climate reporting, including further development of tools and methods for characterizing, monitoring and reporting on results of activities, with an emphasis on harmonizing approaches where possible; and 6) alignment of internal activities, to ensure that internal MDB operations are in line with the Paris Agreement objectives.

A joint MDB working group is developing methods and tools to operationalize this joint effort for each of the building blocks. The MDBs further committed to report to COP 25 on progress on their joint Paris Agreement alignment approach and individual MDB progress towards this alignment.

The HLPF will convene on the afternoon of Tuesday, 24 September and all day on Wednesday, 25 September 2019, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Q&A refers to the meeting as the “SDG Summit,” noting that it will meet under the auspices of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at the level of Heads of State and Heads of Government. The chair will be the president of UNGA 74.

DESA points to three expected outcomes from the Summit: a political declaration, a range of voluntary commitments, and the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the UN’s role. On the political declaration, DESA says that this will be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the Forum, following negotiations by Member States in a process to be co-facilitated by the permanent representatives of Bahamas and Sweden. The declaration will provide political guidance on accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, DESA notes.

On the voluntary commitments, the Q&A says that governments and stakeholders are encouraged to announce commitments for the implementation of SDGs. Commitments can be announced during the Summit, or online before the Summit.

On the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and UN role, DESA suggests that the Summit “could demonstrate the benefits of an inclusive multilateralism through the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the revitalization of the United Nations’ role in linking peace and security, human rights and development and promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda as the international community seeks to provide global solutions to our common challenges, promote prosperity for all and endeavor to leave no one behind.”

The three events will be mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate progress towards sustainable development, DESA notes.

The Summit also is expected to play several other roles, including:

Enable the international community to look back at areas where progress has been insufficient to meet the Goals on time, and identify what can be done to catalyze the needed changes;

Identify and showcase areas of progress, and consider actions needed for scaling up;

Share experiences and best practices, and provide access to tools that can accelerate change; and

Provide a space for building partnerships to further SDG achievement at all levels.

The Summit will convene in parallel to the UNGA’s general debate as it begins its 74th session in September 2019. Taking place back-to-back with the Summit will be the 2019 Climate Summit convened by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and the UNGA’s High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development (FFD). Like the SDG Summit/HPLF meeting under UNGA auspices, the FFD dialogue is mandated by the 2030 Agenda to take place every four years. DESA notes that the three events will be “mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate the progress towards sustainable development.”

Finally, the Summit will include side events, special events and exhibitions on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, civil society meetings, and an SDG media zone.

346,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-administrator-updates-member-states-on-resident-coordinator-system-reforms/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Administrator Updates Member States on Resident Coordinator System Reforms,"14 November 2018: Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, briefed UN Member States on the reforms to the UN development system at a meeting of UNDP’s executive board. He described UNDP’s work with the UN Secretary-General’s transition team to ensure that the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019.



Among Steiner’s updates was the announcement that the transition of the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) was completed on 1 November 2018, and DOCO is now part of the Secretariat, with funding from UNDP and its current configuration until June 2019 in order to ensure a smooth transition.

Steiner said the system went through an exercise to determine how many of the current 129 Resident Coordinators (RC) want to remain RCs, and how many want to return to UNDP or their originating agencies. The exercise was completed at the end of September 2018, with 117 of them choosing to remain RCs. Thus the “lift and shift” operation will consist of moving 90% of the current RCs from UNDP to the Secretariat. He said this implies developing a service level agreement that will cover a second request by the Secretary-General, comprised of: putting in place an infrastructure to allow the RCs to operate on 1 January 2019; helping staff their offices in 129 countries; and setting the payroll for the 129 RCs and 1,200 RC offices and DOCO staff that form the new RC system.

Steiner reported that this operation will cost UNDP US$2.6 million, and emphasized the need to ensure sufficient funding for the Secretariat to support the new structure moving forward. He said the cost of the contribution to the RC system by UNDP will be US$10.3 million.

“Everything is happening as we speak,” Steiner noted, with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) currently developing new job descriptions for the RCs, as well as the mutual accountability framework between RCs and the UN country teams. This exercise is being conducted as a collaboration between UNDP, the UN Secretariat, and the transition team, Steiner said. He added that interim protocols and internal control frameworks are also needed for the process to delink the RCs from UNDP.

Steiner also flagged the required “unprecedented exercise” of replacing the 117 UNDP country resident representatives, since the current RCs have been playing that role. He said that UNDP has had four months to identify and appoint the new resident representatives by the end of 2018. He reported that in one month of advertising the openings, UNDP received 3,500 applications, and 195 candidates are currently shortlisted. He saluted the fact that 22% of the candidates are from Africa.

Steiner noted that UNDP is coming from “an extremely contractive period,” in which it was in deficit while Member States’ contributions were at a historical low, and hundreds of posts were frozen or eliminated; the total staff decreased by 1,000 of its total of 8,000 between 2012 and 2017. Currently, UNDP is increasing at a rate of 6-9% per annum, and replacing its pyramidal structure with a “21st century” global policy expertise network, which will be rolled out starting 1 January 2019. Steiner said more resources are going to Africa and the Arab states in conflict, UNDP is reducing operational costs while delivering more, and it is “delivering on the promises for the UN development system reform.”

Steiner added that UNDP is exceeding delivery on all its six of its “signature solutions” in 2018, and anticipated having one of the highest rates of delivery in the history of the UN.

In the ensuing discussion, Member States asked whether UNDP or the RC will play the integrative role for the UN presence in countries (Albania), inquired about the timeline for new appointments to be discussed with host governments (El Salvador), asked about an internal communication strategy for UNDP’s new relationship with other UN agencies on the ground (Switzerland), asked what the impact will be on multi-country offices (Antigua and Barbuda), and requested information on plans for private sector partnerships (Netherlands, Sweden and US).

Steiner said UNDP will move away from coordinating UN agencies’ activity on the ground. He emphasized that the role of the RC is not to implement the SDGs, but to coordinate SDG implementation on the ground, and UNDP will support the RCs when requested. He explained that UNDP’s integrative platform is an offer, with the agencies on the ground and the RCs to decide if or when to use it. He clarified that UNDP’s principal role is not to serve as the integrative platform for the UN system but provide the development support.

The UNDP Administrator said the appointment letters for the RCs were to be sent to countries in November 2018. He also added that no major changes will be made to the current composition of the UNDP country teams.

The “new vision for the Resident Coordinator” is outlined on the UN’s reform website, which also provides other information on the repositioning of the UN development system, overall.

The MOP also agreed on key species action plans on African-Eurasian waterbirds, and adopted a resolution on AEWA’s contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Agreement’s relevance to the SDGs.

MOP 7 took place under the theme, ‘Beyond 2020: Shaping Flyway Conservation for the Future.’ The meeting convened from 4-8 December in Durban, South Africa.

On the Aichi Targets and the SDGs, the MOP determines that the greatest benefits to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 are AEWA implementation actions that, inter alia: ensure the conservation and wise use of national networks of protected areas; ensure that land uses are fully compatible with sustaining migratory waterbird populations; reduce, mitigate and compensate for habitat loss and degradation as appropriate, restore degraded habitats to reverse past losses and create new multifunctional wetlands; implement climate change adaptation measures related to waterbird habitats; remove unnecessary causes of waterbird mortality and ensure that harvests, where made, are sustainable; and develop strong engagement with local communities on the management and wise use of waterbirds and their wetland habitats. The MOP urges Parties to ensure that national authorities responsible for AEWA implementation are fully involved in updating national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) to further promote synergies between biodiversity-related treaties; and urges Parties to highlight to their development agencies the relevance of AEWA implementation in the context of SDG delivery and to stress the need to better integrate actions for waterbird and wetland conservation within relevant development projects to achieve benefits for both waterbirds and human communities. The MOP requests the Technical Committee to bring an assessment of AEWA’s contributions to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and a reflection on AEWA’s contribution to the post-2020 development agenda to MOP 8.

Climate change is a key driver of species decline.

Delegates adopted resolutions on, inter alia: guidance on the implementation of the AEWA Action Plan; climate-resilient flyways; strengthening the monitoring of migratory waterbirds; and financial and institutional arrangements. The AEWA Plan of Action for Africa for 2019-2027 responds to contemporary waterbirds conservation issues in Africa and across the flyway. MOP 7 also considered a report on the effects of plastic on waterbirds and on the conservation status of species listed under the Agreement.

On key species action plans, MOP 7 adopted new International Single Species Action and Management Plans (ISSAPs and ISSMPs) for the Barnacle Goose and Greylag Goose. The MOP extended the ISSAPs and ISSMPs for Black-tailed Godwit, Eurasian Spoonbill, Ferruginous Duck, Great Snipe, Lesser Flamingo, Maccoa Duck, Madagascar Pond Heron and White-winged Flufftail for an additional ten years. In addition, MOP 7 retired the plans for the Light-bellied Brent Goose and Black-winged Pratincole.

AEWA Executive Secretary, Jacques Trouvilliez, welcomed the MOP’s adoption of a new Strategic Plan and a Plan of Action for Africa. He said this mandate will enable all countries to collaborate to “ensure a future for waterbirds across a flyway that stretches from the very tip of Africa, across the Middle East to the High Arctic.” Trouvilliez also underscored the Agreement’s work to make the flyway more resilient to climate change, noting that climate change is a key driver of species decline.

AEWA is an intergovernmental treaty focused on the conservation of migratory waterbirds that migrate along the African-Eurasian Flyway. The Agreement covers 254 species of birds that are ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle.

348,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/a-shark-tale-growing-conservation-infrastructure-for-pelagic-species/,"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: A Shark Tale: Growing Conservation Infrastructure for Pelagic Species,"Globally, shark populations are threatened by a long and difficult list of challenges. They include over-fishing, fisheries by-catch, illegal trade, habitat destruction, depletion of prey, pollution, boat strikes and climate change – according to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). These obstacles – formidable on their own – are compounded by the pelagic nature of many sharks. They range beyond any one country’s borders or jurisdiction.

In this context and amid declining populations, almost a decade ago, countries came together to do something about it. A big step was taken on 1 March 2010, in Manila, the Philippines – when range States signed into effect the CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. This was the first dedicated global instrument focused on safeguarding pelagic sharks. Its establishment set in motion a series of important policy steps that would raise awareness and the stakes for sharks conservation well into the future.

The first event was a meeting of the MoU signatories in 2012. With funding provided under the European Union Thematic Programme for Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy (ENRTP), the First Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 1) to the MoU convened in 2012. Its major outcome was the adoption of a Global Conservation Plan for the seven sharks species listed (at that time) under the MOU. The Plan aimed to catalyze global and regional initiatives to reduce threats to migratory sharks and to maintain their favorable conservation status based on the best available scientific information.

The Plan was based on five objectives: improving the understanding of migratory shark populations through research, monitoring and information exchange; ensuring that directed and non-directed fisheries for sharks were sustainable; ensuring, to the extent practicable, the protection of critical habitats and migratory corridors and critical life stages of sharks; increased public awareness of threats to sharks and their habitats, and enhanced public participation in conservation activities; and enhanced national, regional and international cooperation.

2014 shaped up to be an important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU.

Two years later, 2014 would shape up to be an incredibly important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU and Conservation Plan.

First, progress was made, also with ENTRP support, towards the implementation of the Plan, particularly to prevent wildlife trafficking in sharks in the Middle East and North Africa Region. Three workshops were organized to inform fisheries officers, custom officers and coast guards about legal requirements and guidelines regarding the conservation of sharks under various Conventions and relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). These meetings were held in Yemen, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and they exemplified the kind of outreach needed for the MoU to gain traction. Through these meetings, Arab countries came together to combat illegal international trade and looked for ways to collaborate under the framework of MoU. By the time these meetings concluded in 2014, the MoU’s membership had grown by 33%, with nine Arab countries joining.

Second, recognition of the MoU went beyond range State countries all the way to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). In a 2014 resolution, the UNGA welcomed a FAO review of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and affirmed the importance of the Sharks MoU (See A/RES/67/79).

Finally and also in 2014, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CMS (COP 11) convened in November. Of the thirty-one approved proposals to add species to the Convention’s two appendices, a record 21 shark, ray and sawfish species were added, as proposed by Kenya, Egypt, the European Union, Fiji, Costa Rica and Ecuador and leading the Conference to be nicknamed the “Sharks COP.” These listings were made as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group (SSG) released the results of the first-ever global analysis showing that a quarter of the world’s sharks and rays were threatened with extinction.

The work of the MoU was timely and gaining momentum. By 2016, as the Second Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 2) convened, MoU membership had grown to 40 countries. At this meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 15-19 February 2016, these Signatory States added 22 additional shark and ray species to Annex I of the MoU. They also created a Conservation Working Group.

Signatory States have now gathered for their third meeting, which is taking place from 10-14 December 2018, in Monaco. With 29 species now listed under the MoU, well beyond the seven species when it originally commenced, these States will discuss progress on the Action Plan and the agreement. It will also be an opportunity to harness momentum for the MoU, which has enabled collaboration on the conservation of sharks at a time when challenges to the ocean and all its inhabitants are growing.

349,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/gentle-rain-from-heaven/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Gentle Rain from Heaven,"Do you recall Shakespeare’s masterpiece, ‘The Merchant of Venice?’ The story is set in the 16th century “Floating City.” Although past its heyday, it is still teeming with wealthy merchants making huge gains from silk or spice trade. Antonio, one of those wealthy merchants, has defaulted on his loan because he lost his ships at sea. His moneylender, Shylock, is pursuing his debts, asking for a pound of flesh.

It was around this time that insurance as we know it was invented, developed as a mechanism particularly in response to the needs of merchants – not necessarily to protect their flesh, but to protect their wealth, in case ships were lost to pirates or storms.

From the 16th to the 21st Century

Fast forward more than 400 years, the insurance industry has expanded and evolved.

Insurance is now available to us in many forms. We are all acquainted with life, health and home insurance. Those making a living from agriculture are also familiar with crop insurance, available to safeguard against the unexpected arrival (or not) of rain.

Yet while it is more widespread, it not yet universal. Just as many people in developed countries cannot imagine life without it, it continues to be out of reach for many, including farmers in developing countries.

Take the Philippines, one of the countries I have worked closely with over the last five years. Here, only 6 and 3 percent of rice and corn farmers, respectively, are protected by insurance. Probably the Venetian merchants of yore were more protected than Filipino farmers today.

Pursuing Protection for the Most Vulnerable

The question is how do we extend coverage to those who need it most? Essentially, we need to innovate.

In the Philippines, the Government and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) are doing just this: between 2014 and 2017, we tested a form of crop insurance accessible and affordable specifically for poor farmers: weather index-based insurance, or ‘WIBI’.

Under the project, financed by the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) established under the UNFCCC, WIBI was delivered to more than 2,000 farmers. Put simply, instead of payments contingent on damage verification by insurance agents (often months after an event), payments were automatically made within five days of rainfall being registered as too much or too little.

This short animation explains why crop insurance has traditionally been inaccessible for such farmers, why WIBI is considered a promising alternative and what we achieved.

Not There Yet

What were the results? Some 2,413 farmers signed up for a WIBI policy. Over the course of three years, 178 of those received payouts, totaling nearly US$30,000. Importantly, the recipients received payouts within five days, proving the advantage of WIBI over traditional insurance. The fast payouts enabled them to re-start planting activities in the same cropping cycle. This is critical as most farmers take out loans to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and a bad harvest immediately puts them in debt.

Does this mean that WIBI will replace traditional insurance? I don’t think so. During implementation, we also learned about the inherent shortcomings of WIBI, the biggest of which is the fact it only covers damage related to rainfall. It does not cover pests and diseases, which rice farmers report as an equally big risks for production.

In addition, the concept of WIBI is extremely difficult for farmers to understand. While traditional insurance is pretty intuitive – any damages on a farm, once verified by an insurance agent, will be compensated, whether they are due to pests, diseases or rainfall – compensation under WIBI is determined by whether the right amount of rain falls in the various stages of a crop’s growth. Yet farmers often don’t know how many millimeters of rain are required in different stages for good harvests, creating confusion as to eligibility.

Many of us can probably empathize. I certainly cannot explain what kind of coverage I have under my health insurance.

Where to Now?

Our work with the Government of the Philippines yielded some important findings: neither WIBI nor traditional insurance has the kind of versatility to make it attractive for poor farmers; and we need to be prepared to evolve different models and means of delivering insurance.

Efforts are underway. Recent technological advancements are reducing the time-consuming payout process of traditional insurance. For example, some are testing the use of photos taken by farmers themselves with their mobile phones for verifying damages. Meanwhile, satellite images, which are becoming cheaper and more precise, are also being used to verify damages on the ground.

Our work also highlighted fundamental questions about how best to protect poor farmers. Should countries invest their finite resources in developing better insurance products as we tried to do with the Government of the Philippines? Or should the same resources be used in educating farmers for pests and disease management, or in irrigation development so that insurance is not needed in the first place? Although the concept of crop insurance is gaining currency in developing countries, these questions are hardly asked, and the conundrums remain unresolved.

Gentle Rain No Longer Drops from Heaven

Returning to ‘The Merchant of Venice.’ The finale nears when Portia makes a plea to the moneylender Shylock to show mercy:

The quality of mercy is not strained;

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven;

Upon the place beneath…

(Act 4, Scene 1)

In the end, Antonio is saved. He also learns that his ships returned safely.

Farmers are not so lucky. If they have to default on their loans because of bad harvests, their lives must go on. There is no Portia to make a plea for them.

World leaders meet again in Katowice, Poland, this month to agree on the rulebook for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as promised in the landmark Paris Agreement three years ago but effective climate action does not appear to be in sight yet. As another year goes by with GHG emissions unabated, the quality of mercy seems to be strained as the gentle rain no longer drops from heaven.

A couple of weeks ago, on the night of an Aquaman screening, I accidentally went to the wrong theater, and was chagrined for more reasons than one to find myself sitting through the first few minutes of Peter Jackson’s dystopian Mortal Engines (which went on to tank with both audiences and critics).

Since I had blown my chance to catch Aquaman that night, I briefly toyed with the idea of staying for Mortal Engines, but quickly decided against it. What I saw in those few minutes struck me as off-puttingly bleak, ugly and dull, like so much Hollywood spectacle these days.

So many blockbusters pour millions of dollars in immense computer-generated illusions that may be more or less persuasive, but aren’t especially worth looking at. Superhero movies are especially guilty of this. Cities are laid waste, planets are imperiled, fleets of starships clash, but not a single memorably crafted image of beauty or poetic power lingers in the imagination.

There are occasional exceptions. Black Panther’s Wakanda was a production design triumph. Doctor Strange, above all, crafted a dazzling visual vocabulary to express the magical world its characters inhabit.

What else? I recall no visual poetry in Avengers: Infinity War or Justice League. I’ve seen Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 twice each, but their brightly colored fantasies are as ephemeral as cotton candy.

So, now that I have managed to see Aquaman, there is this to say for it: Like the Star Wars prequels, like James Cameron’s Avatar, it’s a movie with tons of problems, but it also contains images that made me catch my breath — gorgeous and even numinous sights I will remember forever.

At times it feels almost like a setting for a live-action Hayao Miyazaki film, which is about the highest praise I could give for blockbuster production design.

Miyazaki has often found mythic power in human spaces, especially ancient cityscapes, flooded with water. However he would feel about this rather dim-witted film as a whole, I suspect the animation legend would appreciate the vision of Atlantis conjured by director James Wan (the Conjuring movies) and production designer Bill Brzeski, abetted by cinematographer Don Burgess (Cast Away, The Conjuring 2).

That’s not just due to the mesmerizing beauty of its translucent, jellyfish-like structures rising from the sea floor on slender stalks, with sea-creature-esque vessels soaring among them alongside actual sea creatures, but also for the haunting juxtaposition of the living bioluminescent cityscape with the shattered domes and pillars at the city’s roots: the ancient ruins of the original island city destroyed when Atlantis sank.

In the first of a pattern of striking parallels to Black Panther, Atlantis is just one of seven undersea kingdoms, each with its own vibe, all descended from the original Atlantean civilization.

What’s more, the plot turns on a struggle for the Atlantean throne between our hero and a sinister relative who wants to unite the kingdoms to wage war on the surface world for its malfeasance — in this case the despoiling of the world’s oceans rather than racial injustice, although racial themes also play a role here.

That’s because our hero, Arthur Curry, the half-Atlantean Aquaman (Jason Momoa), is disparaged by his full-blooded Atlantean half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) as a “half-breed” and “mongrel” (as well as a “bastard,” though the marital status of Arthur’s parents isn’t established).

As the first major superhero film with a virtually all-black cast, Black Panther is a landmark achievement, but racism and racial alienation are depicted in Aquaman where Black Panther only talked about them.

When Momoa was cast, I thought his Pacific Island heritage well suited to playing a man of the sea. Oddly, though, Aquaman establishes that the Atlanteans are Aryan; Arthur’s brown heritage comes not from his royal marine mother (Nicole Kidman), but from his human father, a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison, of partly Maori descent).

In another reversal of Black Panther, it’s the malevolent Orm who sits on the throne while Arthur is the outsider living in exile. Unlike Killmonger in Black Panther, moreover, Arthur wants nothing to do with Atlantis or his royal heritage (he’s got a major Aragorn complex).

Aquaman starts out unpromisingly enough. From the prologue, depicting the brief, star-crossed romance of Arthur’s parents in the wake of his mother’s attempt to flee an arranged marriage, to early action sequences involving submarines, the first act is pretty rote and surprise-free.

When Mera (Amber Heard), a red-tressed submariner from the undersea kingdom of Xebel, comes looking for Arthur, hoping he will challenge his brother for the throne and avert war with the surface world, Arthur initially wants nothing to do with it.

Things get more interesting when Arthur winds up being taken in chains, much like his mother years earlier, to Atlantis.

There’s an abrupt tonal shift as Arthur and Mera escape from Atlantis and embark on a quest for the fabled Trident of Atlan. In this Arthurian mythos, this is the equivalent of Excalibur, and would establish Aquaman not only as the rightful king of Atlantis, but as the master of the seven seas.

Here Aquaman improbably morphs into what feels more like an Indiana Jones sequel — or more precisely a Brendan Fraser Mummy movie — with the action moving from an underground desert crypt to a picturesque Sicilian coastal village. A lucidly directed and edited rooftop chase sequence pitting Mera against a tough but fragile opponent is a highlight in a film where a lot of the action is underwater.

Moving into the third act, the tone shifts again into full-on mythic mode. Aquaman faces an ordeal that goes to the heart of what heroism is as well as the nature of his claim to the throne.

In the climax, the parallels with Black Panther almost function as a rebuke to the earlier film. Black Panther was efficient and elegant where Aquaman is clunky and awkward; but by the same token Aquaman is wondrous and powerful where Black Panther is functional at best.

There are a half-dozen characters in Black Panther I care about more than I do anyone in Aquaman. But where Black Panther’s big climactic CGI battle was that film’s least interesting sequence, in Aquaman it’s a finale of preposterous grandeur, with leviathans and sea monsters that are a credit to Wan’s horror background. The final duel, too, is more satisfying on a number of levels, from what happens to why and how it happens to what happens afterward.

Like Thor in his first outing, Aquaman must prove himself worthy to wield an all-powerful weapon — but where Thor basically whiffed on what worthiness is all about, Aquaman proposes a ringing answer. There’s also moral progression from an early set piece in which, with fateful consequences, a heedless Arthur shows no mercy to an enemy (“Ask the sea for mercy,” he sneers) to the very different note of the denouement.

One thing is missing from this mythology: some representation of transcendent reality. Wonder Woman had the classical Greek gods, and Black Panther’s story started with a panther goddess and depicted mystical encounters with departed ancestors. Aquaman has a throwaway line about “the gods” making known their will through combat, but no thought went into this.

Aquaman is kind of a mess, but at its best it’s a glorious mess in a way that few popcorn movies these days are glorious. Roast it as much as you like, there is still joy to be had here.

As the first major superhero film with a virtually all-black cast, Black Panther is a landmark achievement, but racism and racial alienation are depicted in Aquaman where Black Panther only talked about them.

The Uganda NAP-Ag framework, a partnership among UN agencies, government institutions, non-State actors, academia and research agencies, presents adaptation actions for different agro-ecological zones, and aims to guide farmers, technical officers and decision makers on investments aimed at increasing the resilience of communities, systems and institutions. It provides 21 priority adaptation options in the areas of: crop production; livestock production; fisheries management; climate information, early warning and disaster preparedness; forestry, land and natural resources management; and research and knowledge management. It also links to government commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.

Climate actions and solutions, which will help achieve SDG 13 must also contribute to achieving SDG 5 by being gender-responsive.

During the launch of the framework on 28 November 2018, UN Resident Coordinator in Uganda, Rosa Malango, underscored that climate actions and solutions, which will help achieve SDG 13 (climate action), must also contribute to achieving SDG 5 (gender equality) by being gender-responsive and giving rural women relief due to the fact that women are the hardest hit by the negative impacts of climate change. Participants also highlighted that, inter alia, NAP-Ag has set a good foundation and precedent for the preparation of NAPs for other sectors.

Integrating agriculture into NAPs will also help to enhance: institutional capacities and processes for operationalizing climate response strategies in the agriculture sector; access to international climate finance sources; and strategic allocations of national budgets earmarked for adaptation investments. Next steps include disseminating the plan to relevant stakeholders, resource mobilization and implementation of the 21 adaptation options.

The strategic framework was developed with technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), through the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs (NAP-Ag) Programme, which supports partner countries to identify and integrate climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sectors into relevant national planning and budgeting processes. The NAP-Ag Programme is funded the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU).

The Polish Presidency of COP 24 hosted a special event for ministers and heads of delegations on ‘Forests for Climate’ to highlight the role of forests in achieving the Paris Agreement on climate change. Speaking at the event, Poland’s Minister of the Environment, Henryk Kowalczyk, said Poland’s forest cover has systematically expanded, increasing by 504,000 hectares between 1995 and 2004. He stressed that the Polish Presidency wants to show how to strive to achieve a balance between greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and absorption “through the application of innovative solutions in the field of forest management and by relying on the natural process of carbon dioxide absorption by soil and forests.” Following discussion, ministers adopted the Declaration by acclamation.

Ministers encourage the scientific community to continue to explore and quantify the contribution of sinks and reservoirs of GHGs in managed land.

In the Declaration, ministers pledge to accelerate actions to ensure that the global contribution of forests and forest products is maintained and further supported and enhanced by 2050 to support achievement of the Paris Agreement. Ministers encourage the scientific community to continue to explore and quantify the contribution of sinks and reservoirs of GHGs in managed lands, including forests, to achieve a balance between anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the second half of this century and to explore ways to increase this contribution. Ministers further encourage non-Party stakeholders, including cities, regions, businesses and investors, to continue to display their ambition and commitments in their forestry-related climate actions through the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the NAZCA Platform.

The Declaration builds on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, the UNFCCC and related instruments, the Warsaw Framework for REDD+, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the UN Strategic Plan for Forests and other global and regional initiatives on sustainable forest management. The Declaration stresses the importance of strengthening synergies among these instruments, where appropriate.

The Declaration is the third deliverable championed by the Polish COP 24 Presidency. The first deliverable, ‘Driving Change Together: Katowice Partnership for Electromobility,’ is a dedicated framework for encouraging technological and organizational changes in the sector to further develop zero-emission transport.

According to the SDG India Index, the nation as a whole has a score of 58, showing the country has reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the sustainable development goals adopted by India and 192 other nations in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.

Four goals, including climate action and sustainable use of marine resources, were left out because of lack of data at the state level.

Kerala’s overall top rank (69) is attributed to its strong performance in providing good health, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100—the point at which it fully meets the sustainable development goal.

Himachal Pradesh ranks high with a similar overall score in providing clean water and sanitation, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among Union territories, Chandigarh takes the lead with a score of 68 on account of its track record in providing clean water and sanitation. Performance in providing quality education has also helped Chandigarh achieve the high score.

Tamil Nadu topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh.

Kerala and Tamil Nadu also topped in facilitating good health and well-being. Gender equality, however, is an area all states and the nation as a whole need to improve upon. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.

Jharkhand, Odisha and Nagaland are also among the states that have a lot more ground to cover in the overall rankings.

The scores represent the current status of achievement in meeting the goals. NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant said that the index, which is also available for reference in the form of an online dashboard, will be updated in realtime. “This will lead to a lot of changes at the grass root level. Competition among states is key in achieving the SDG,"" said Kant.

NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar urged the fifteenth finance commission (FFC) member Ramesh Chand, who was present on the occasion, to use the index as a tool while finalizing its recommendations on sharing of central government’s divisible pool of tax revenue with states. “Unless development becomes a mass movement, I do not think we can achieve what we want to,"" said Kumar. In an interview, Chand said that the SDG India index relies on the most recent data and will be a useful resource for the FFC. India’s progress in achieving these goals are crucial for the world as it is home to about 17% of the world population, said a statement from NITI Aayog.

The Alliance aims to: help raise capital for climate investments in developing countries; encourage other countries to increase their climate protection efforts and financial contributions to developing countries; and compensate for unavoidable emissions by supporting international climate protection projects.

Facilitating emission reduction and carbon offsetting processes helps to raise funds and enable financial transfers to developing countries.

The Alliance seeks to make it easier for companies and organizations to finance carbon dioxide (CO2) offset projects in developing countries, such as biogas plants, wind power, solar energy and reforestation. Such projects avoid emissions or remove them from the atmosphere, while promoting economic and social development locally. The Alliance also aims to promote the voluntary CO2 market by improving the political framework for voluntary offsetting and helping companies network with offsetting specialists and project developers.

A First Climate press release notes that “facilitating emission reduction and carbon offsetting processes helps to raise funds and enable financial transfers to emerging and developing countries where climate protection projects can be implemented easily and more effectively than in industrialized countries.” Such projects also support sustainable development, have a positive impact on people and the environment, and generate social, economic and environmental co-benefits.

The partners proposed a partnership and an annual forum that would underline how a transition to clean transport can provide cleaner air, innovative industry and a safe and stable climate.

According to the UNFCCC, the transportation sector has had the fastest emissions growth of any sector over the last 50 years. The transportation sector is responsible for 23 percent of global energy-related carbon emissions, and represents a major source of air pollution.

COP 24 is a platform to promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.

Kurtyka said the Polish COP 24 Presidency proposes “e-mobility as one of the main topics of this year’s COP.” He explained that Poland aims to contribute to global climate policy and galvanize global trends towards electromobility through the Partnership and its annual forum. He highlighted Poland’s experience in implementing legislation and projects on electromobility, including the ‘Zero Emission Urban Bus System’ (ZeEUS). Kurtyka stressed that Poland wants e-mobility actions “to become an impulse towards ensuring universal opportunities to live in clean, environmentally friendly cities.” Harrington said the UK and Poland “are calling on all countries to renew their efforts to accelerate the transition to low-emission vehicles to create a cleaner, greener legacy for future generations.”

The ‘Driving Change Together Partnership,’ or ‘Katowice Partnership for E-Mobility,’ is a dedicated framework for encouraging technological and organizational changes in the sector to further develop zero-emission transport. A proposal on the Partnership stresses that transport must be decarbonized to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and underlines the potential economic, health and environmental benefits of a transition to a low-carbon economy, in particular the development and deployment of zero-emission vehicles. The proposal recognizes initiatives committed to achieving the goal of sustainable transport and development of e-mobility, and calls on Parties and non-Party stakeholders to use COP 24 as a platform to “promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.” The proposal further declares an intent to work together to ensure that e-mobility and the UNFCCC process “complement and enhance each other” and share experience and expertise towards e-mobility through capacity building and peer-to-peer cooperation.

Through the Partnership, supported by an annual forum, the Polish COP 24 Presidency will create a network of partnerships between regional and national governments, cities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to build and share knowledge of electromobility and accelerate a “transport e-mobility revolution” at international and local levels.

The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.

These two new ambulances, and every ambulance to be purchased going forward will have a new Stryker Power-Load System and new blue emergency lighting systems on the front and back.

The new power lift system lifts the ambulance stretcher and the patient into the ambulance and locks it in place without effort from the paramedics.

“This is a new safety system for paramedics and patients,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall and SDG Paramedics. “Until now, the paramedics had to lift all of the weight.”

Lister explained that the stretcher weighs 100 pounds, and that their average patient weighs 190 pounds, but that the new power-load system can lift up to 700 pounds.

The new power-load system will reduce the annual lifting load of paramedics by over 10 million pounds a year.

The new lighting system on the ambulances replaces the traditional red-white emergency lights on the front and back of the vehicle with a red-blue combo.

“Many studies have shown that the blue lights are more noticeable and effective in difficult weather situations like fog, rain and snow,” said Lister.

The Stryker Power-Load System costs $27,000 each and the new emergency lighting system will cost $600 each. Right now, only the two newest ambulances are equipped with these systems. Cornwall and SDG Paramedics replace an ambulance every 54 months and their goal is to have their entire fleet of 14 ambulances equipped with these systems within four years.","CORNWALL, Ontario – The Cornwall and SDG Paramedics Service unveiled two new ambulances on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018 that come with two new features that promise to increase the safety of paramedics and patients.

GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has expressed dissatisfaction over the state’s ranking at the fourth spot in the SDG ( Sustainable Development Goals ) Index by the Niti Ayog in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday and instructed secretaries to take the SDG index ranks of Gujarat seriously — especially the poor rank on social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health etc.

The officials also claim that the state could have performed better if the state schemes and other indicators had been included in the overall ranking. Chief secretary J N Singh also reportedly directed secretaries for regular monitoring of the goals and preparation of the district-wise goals to improve Gujarat’s SDG ranking next year.

Niti Aayog classified the states on four grades namely Achiever (100 score-1st grade), front runner(65-99 score-2nd grade), Performer (50-64 score 3rd grade) and Aspirant (0-49 score-4th grade). Though Gujarat managed to achieve 4th rank (along with other five states) in overall score due to its performance in industry, sanitation, urban management etc., its performance on the key social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health, gender ratio balancing have shown the state in very poor light as the state is clubbed with low-ranking states.

A senior officer close to the development said, “To improve the state’s ranking in the SDG index the strategy have been made to aligning/mapping of 388 state indicators identified by the State with 306 National Indicators Framework (NIF) through consultations with the line departments. Preparation of indicator-wise meta data by the state SDG cell and other agencies have been initiated. For a day-to-day monitoring, development of the state SDG dashboard will be started shortly.”

“The government has also decided to constitute district level SDG implementation committees,’’ said the official.

SDG SDG SDG

Mountain bike component manufacturer SDG has a cool new upgrade kit that’s colour-coordinated and could be the perfect Christmas present for young riders.

Advertisement

The JR PRO KIT boxed-set comprises saddle, handlebar, grips and pedals, which are made, says SDG, to a similar standard as its main product lines.

The kit is designed for young riders on 18in- to 24in-wheeled bikes. There are four colour ways on offer: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue.

SDG

SDG Fly Jr saddle

SDG is known for its saddles, having been in the business of producing them for over 20 years. It’s taken that expertise and applied it to developing a saddle specifically for younger, smaller, lighter riders.

The Fly Jr saddle is constructed from synthetic leather with tough cordura sides for wear resistance. It’s shorter and narrower and has been ergonomically designed to fit smaller sit bones, according to SDG.

It’s also got a slight rise at the rear to help get the pelvis in a comfortable position, and to push against when powering off from a standing start. There’s also a small nose platform for climbing.

SDG Slater 90 pedals

These nylon composite pedals have a low profile design of 18mm and a 90x90mm platform for smaller feet. The pedals include six replaceable 2mm steel pins per side for grip.

A cro-mo axle with fully sealed bushing is designed to last a lot longer than many of the cheaper, plastic kids’ pedals on the market, and is also serviceable to keep it running. You’ll also be able to purchase additional parts and pins.

SDG Slater 650 handlebar

The cockpit has had some consideration put into it too. The Slater 650 handlebar is, unsurprisingly, 650mm wide and constructed from 6061 aluminium.

While the mount is 31.8mm, the bars taper to 19mm rather than the standard 22.2mm to suit smaller hands and fit the thinner Slater JR grips.

The bars are also supplied with four 15mm nylon shims, which will allow standard brakes and shifters to be mounted.

Slater Jr grips

To finish the whole set off it comes with colour-matched grips designed specifically for smaller hands. In addition to fitting on the thinner 19mm diameter handlebars, the grips also have a dual-density design that offers vibration damping and have a lock-on system.

SDG

SDG Jr PRO Kit price and availability

The SDG Jr PRO Kit is available now for £129.95 / $149.99 via SDG or Silverfish in the UK.

364,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse,"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse’,"Here, at last, is the Spidey that family audiences need and the Spidey they deserve — and that’s just two of them!

One day in 1982, when I was 13 years old, I had just left the Haledon Sweet Shop on Haledon Avenue with a stack of comic books, bought with money earned delivering papers for the owner of the sweet shop. I stopped at Food Town to buy a candy bar and a Coke, and a young black boy, perhaps 8, saw the comics in my hand and asked if he could have one of them.

I was willing — but which one? I leafed through the small stack, chagrined to realize that the storylines of Daredevil and X-Men were too mature and involved for a younger reader.

Then I had it: I handed him the latest Marvel Tales, reprinting an early Amazing Spider-Man from 1963. Those early Spider-Man stories were simple and self-contained — ideally targeted to young readers. (Our transaction had escaped the notice of his mother, who caught up to me near the exit, a bit flustered, and offered to pay for the comic, which I didn’t accept.)

I wish, now, that I had been able to introduce that boy to Miles Morales, the young hero of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

For that matter, I’ve felt a similar chagrin for years watching Hollywood churn out one superhero blockbuster after another — all PG-13, except for the rare R rating. If Guardians of the Galaxy is too tame for your tastes, Hollywood has you covered with Deadpool and Logan. But what about viewers too young for Guardians of the Galaxy? Where is their superhero movie?

I’ve always found Spider-Man the most relatable of all classic superheroes, certainly for children. But even Spider-Man: Homecoming, despite featuring the youngest big-screen Spidey to date, threw in unnecessarily crude language and sexually themed humor.

Which brings me to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Here, at last, is the Spidey that family audiences need and the Spidey they deserve — and that’s just two of them!

We also meet the Spidey you wouldn’t exactly want to grow up to become; the Spidey you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley; the Spidey you would want to meet almost anywhere if you could muster the nerve to talk to her; and more besides: over a half-dozen webslingers in all.

Most of these Spider-folks are at least somewhat familiar (“I’m pretty sure you know the rest” is a recurring phrase), though not every Spidey has lost an Uncle Ben, and two of them become some kind of Uncle Ben figure to a third, whose family of origin is intact.

Miles Morales — our main Spidey, voiced by Shameik Moore — is Afro-Latino, the son of a black police officer and a Puerto Rican nurse. (In the comics he made his debut in 2011 in an alternate continuity, but proved popular enough to introduce into what is now the main, ongoing Marvel universe.)

Of the other web-heads, at least three are named Peter Parker; two are girls; one is Asian and has a mecha-suit; and then there’s the one that’s sort of like Porky Pig crossed with Bat-Mite. (Believe it or not, “Peter Porker” first appeared in 1983, long before the “Spider-Pig” gag in The Simpsons Movie.)

So, yeah, different cinematic traditions are also represented here: film noir, anime, even Looney Tunes-type funny animals. The big-screen Spider-Verse is the nuttiest, most creatively daring animated multiverse since — well, since filmmaking partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who produced Into the Spider-Verse (Lord also wrote the story), took on the many faces of the Lego-verse in The Lego Movie.

Which is not remotely to say that Into the Spider-Verse is another exercise in ironic, absurdist superhero self-parody, like this summer’s Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, a deconstructionist hall of mirrors that, while entertaining, basically dispensed entirely with heroism, sacrifice and real stakes.

On the contrary, Into the Spider-Verse is grounded in a winsome sincerity shared by few recent superhero movies (Wonder Woman being the most notable exception).

For Miles, that grounding comes primarily from his relationship with his loving parents, especially his father, a NYPD cop (Brian Tyree Henry). Miles’ mother (Lauren Vélez) plays the familiar maternal role of mediating between Dad and offspring, but for once this isn’t because Dad is unreasonable or overbearing.

The tension between Miles and his father over Miles’ penchant for street art, discouraged by his law-and-order father but supported by his cool uncle (Mahershala Ali), raises the possibility of another tiresome “Junior Knows Best” dynamic — but thankfully it doesn’t work out that way at all.

There’s a moment when Dad drops off Miles at school (an elite charter school Miles has mixed feelings about attending) that is simultaneously every school-age kid’s nightmare about being humiliated by your parents and also drives home how lucky Miles is.

When Miles’ dad tells him “I love you,” I couldn’t help thinking that the last cartoon in which I recall a black father telling his child “I love you” was Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs — also from Lord and Miller.

Cloudy was also super geeky and very silly, so a Spider-Man multiverse story is firmly within Lord and Miller’s wheelhouse.

Not that Miles himself is as geeky as Peter, or as the movie — though he is smart. “I liked your joke,” whispers new girl Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) in response to Miles’ lame quip about being late to class. “It wasn’t funny … but it was smart.” The movie is all three: geeky, funny and smart. It’s family-friendly, but doesn’t dumb down the plot for kids.

The premise involves rifts between dimensions resulting from a desperate gambit by the villainous Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) and a female version of Doctor Octopus (Kathryn Hahn). I won’t explain why the rifts specifically wind up sucking Spider-people from other realities and bringing them into Miles’ world, but there’s a clever reason.

Miles’ world is already unusual because it has two native Spideys, and he is one of them. The other is Peter Parker (Chris Pine), but a Peter Parker who seems a few dimensional clicks outside the Spidey mainstream, judging from his blond hair (among other things). So is his formidable Aunt May, voiced by Lily Tomlin.

This super-together Peter would make an ideal Spider-mentor. Unfortunately, Miles winds up with a somewhat broken-down substitute: an older, cynical Peter (Jake Johnson) who is divorced from Mary Jane (Zoë Kravitz) and has begun to let himself go. This paunchy Parker might have something to teach Miles, but doesn’t seem jazzed about doing it.

That’s a problem, because with a terrifying supervillain called the Prowler stalking him, Miles needs a good mentor in the worst way.

Between his dad, his uncle, the Spidey he didn’t quite get to know, and the Spidey he gets to know better than he’d like, Miles has no shortage of male role models. (That’s before we get to female Spider-mentors like the mysterious, white-hooded Spider-Woman.)

What Miles learns the hard way (vague spoiler ahead) is that some role models are better than others, and people we think we know may be more complicated and more compromised than we would ever suspect. There’s a bitter, ironic twist on the classic Spider-Man origin story: one that will resonate with many viewers who’ve lived long enough to become disillusioned with people they once looked up to, who might have led them down the wrong paths in life.

One of the most thrilling things about Into the Spider-Verse is just how unlike other recent computer-animated films it looks. Though clearly computer animated, it has a hand-drawn, comic-book quality enhanced by occasional onscreen captions, sound effects and panel layouts. It’s sometimes reminiscent of the excellent small-screen Spectacular Spider-Man series, though vastly more sophisticated. It begs to be seen on the big screen.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse changes what is possible for superhero films and animated films. Going beyond even Black Panther and Wonder Woman, it makes the case that our childhood heroes can be anyone and look like anyone. And, wonder of wonders, it does it in a fairly self-contained story that’s actually appropriate for children.

This is the superhero cinematic universe that matters now.

St. Denis said they then started to talk about the animals that didn’t have homes and she asked Richer if he wanted to do something for them.

“I explained it to him and he said, ‘oh yea,’” she said.

This was stated in the NITI Aayog report released on December 21 titled ‘SDG India Index Baseline Report, 2018.’

The government’s premier think tank developed the country’s first SDG India Index to document the progress made by India’s states and Union Territories towards meeting SDG targets and released a baseline report for 2018.

The SDG India Index was constructed spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs (leaving out Goals 12, 13, 14 and 17). The Index tracks the progress of all the States and Union Territories (UTs) on a set of 62 Priority Indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India. The SDG India Index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its States and UTs.

Each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are mapped with a set of 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. These were used as the foundation for building the SDG India Index.

A composite score was computed for each State and UT of India based on their aggregate performance across 13 of the 17 SDGs. The value of the score indicates the average performance of the State/UT towards achieving the 13 SDGs and their respective targets. The score ranges between 0 and 100.

It may be mentioned that if a State achieves a score of 100, it signifies that the State has achieved the national target set for 2030. On the other hand, if a State achieves a score of 0, it signifies that the State was the worst performer.

Target settings and its scores are Achiever (100), Front Runner (65-99), Performer (50-69) and lastly Aspirant (0-49). As per the SDG Index Score of States and UTs, Nagaland stands at a total score of 51 which fall under the ‘Performer’ category.

In the break-up of SDG India Index score by component goals, Nagaland is one of the three worst performers under Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure category with a Zero score. The other two states with zero score include Mizoram and Goa.

However, majority of the States and UTs have fallen behind on this Goal with 26 States and UTs in the ‘Aspirant’ category (with Index score less than 50).

In SDG Index Score for the Goal of Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Nagaland is also among the last three worst performers with a score of 40 with Manipur the lowest with a score of 33 and Jammu & Kashmir at 43.

Under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Good Health and Well-being, Nagaland is again has one of the lowest score (34) under the ‘Aspirant’ category.

However, under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Peace, Justice and Strong, Nagaland is one of the ‘Front Runner’ with a score of 87. Under the Goal of Zero Hunger, Nagaland was accorded 69 points which also falls under the same category. In Goal of Clean Water and Sanitation, Nagaland stood at 58.

The SDG Index Score for the Goal of Reduced Inequalities for Nagaland stood at 80 which fall under the ‘Front Runner’ category, while Meghalaya, Mizoram and Telangana were the only three states which were deemed as ‘Achiever.’

In general, from among the states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have come out as the front runners in implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets.

Along with the three states, the UTs of Chandigarh and Puducherry were also among the front runners on the SDG India Index with a score between 65 to 99 on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 signifies that it has achieved the 2030 national targets.

369,https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/new-safety-features-added-to-cornwall-sdg-ambulances,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Standard Freeholder,New safety features added to Cornwall-SDG ambulances,"“It’s a hydraulic system that is now installed in the ambulance that lifts the stretcher into the truck,” said Lister. “That is important because paramedics are lifting a lot of weight and it is dangerous for them to be lifting that much weight.

The power-load system allows the paramedics to load the stretcher into the ambulance without using muscle power.

“Every year we recycle our ambulances,” said chief of EMS Bill Lister. “They last about five years and on this cycle we have two upgrades. The first one is the power-load system.”

The city has introduced blue flashing lights on ambulances, making them easier to see; and, a Stryker Power-Load System that will aide paramedics in loading patients into the ambulances.

The city announced on Friday it had brought in a couple of safety features that will make things easier, not only for our paramedics, but for drivers who encounter an ambulance on its way to helping residents.

“It’s a neat safety feature for them because it will reduce the loads on their bodies.”

Lister said the lifts act as a forklift in the back of the truck. Paramedics just bring the stretcher to the back of the truck and the forklift system lifts it into the back of the ambulance.

“The paramedic doesn’t have to worry about the lift part,” he said. “They can concentrate more on the patient. It’s a safety system.”

The system has the capacity of lifting a patient and all the emergency equipment up to 700 pounds. Each system costs approximately $27,000 and all 14 ambulances in the city’s fleet should be equipped with them within the next four years.

“There is about 50 pounds of equipment (taken on each stretcher every call) and a patient, about 190 pounds average, plus the stretcher which is about 100 pounds, that is what they used to lift before we got this mechanism,” said Lister. “About 15 years ago, we got these yellow stretchers which are battery powered lift stretchers and now we have the second component which is the power-load.”

The other change in ambulances is the addition of blue flashing lights.

“The change in the Highway Traffic Act allows us to change the lighting pattern on the trucks,” said Lister. “This is a safety feature for two reasons. One it alerts the drivers better to yield to the ambulance and the second it is seen from a greater distance.”

Lister said the decision to add the blue lights was a culmination of a number of studies, which proved blue lights worked best in fog and rain and other weather conditions.

“They realized that white and red was good, but it’s better with a blue light in there,” he said. “We will be rolling these across as we replace the ambulances.”

SDG council was welcomed to its council chambers on Friday as North Glengarry Mayor Jamie MacDonald took his warden’s oath of office.

MacDonald then joked that outgoing councillor Dennis Fife had 100 years of experience alone, but that was OK, change was good.

“Every four years, council gets to do a reset and start to plan this term of office and beyond,” he said. “We have many issues facing this term of council.”

MacDonald said he was hoping for better communication with the City of Cornwall as it was essential to the services they shared.

“Both sides need to work together,” he said. “I am confident under the leadership of Mayor (Bernadette) Clement this is achievable, stronger together.”","Article contentSDG council was welcomed to its council chambers on Friday as North Glengarry Mayor Jamie MacDonald took his warden’s oath of office.
