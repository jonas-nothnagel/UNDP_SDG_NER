In 2012, six young Australians — Jamie Chivers, Monique Alfris, Ben Merven, Katerina Kimmorley, Emma Colenbrander, and Alexie Seller — came together to see if they could find a way for children living in a slum in North Bengaluru, to have light to study.

Initially, the co-founders worked with another Australian social business, 40K Home — an enterprise focussed on providing education to a small migrant community living on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The co-founders focussed their efforts on finding a business model for three slums, but quickly realised there were hundreds of other slum communities that needed their help.

After speaking to suppliers and micro-finance organisations, they realised that no one was willing to provide a solution for these families – they were seen as too poor, and too risky. So, the co-founders decided to start Pollinate Energy and moved to India to set up operations. The co-founders started with a pilot of 100 solar lights, and once they reached that milestone, they knew they had something that worked.

What began as a trial of solar lights in a northern Bengaluru makeshift community, replacing dangerous, unhealthy and costly kerosene, and became an immediate success. Today, Pollinate Energy is a thriving social business, with the purpose of improving the health, safety, quality of life and cost of living of the urban poor in India through the sale of life-changing products. The also brings about wins for the wider community and the environment.

Alexie, Co-founder and CEO of Pollinate Energy, shares,

“It's been a massive learning curve. At the beginning, all co-founders were incredibly good at learning new skills, diving in the deep end, and just doing what needed to be done. However, we found ourselves at a point of transition where we needed more experienced people to lift the company to the next level. We are proud to have seen both our Indian and Australian teams expand!”

Currently, Pollinate Energy offers a range of products, including large solar home systems, water filters, solar fans, clean cookstoves, mobile phones and mosquito nets. In order to continue making the products accessible to families at the “bottom of the pyramid,” they have introduced new pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar technology, which acts like a prepaid SIM card.

So far, Pollinate Energy has provided 27,298 products to over 20,000 families, impacting the lives of more than 123,602 people living in slums. Pollinate Energy now operates across five Indian cities — Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Kanpur. It operates as not-for-profit in Australia, and operates as a social enterprise (registered as an LLP) in India. The products are manufactured by the B-Corp certified organisation Greenlight Planet, which owns manufacturing facilities in China, and some lights are assembled in East Africa and India. Pollinate Energy’s flagship product, SunKing Pro2 generally sells at Rs 3,000 paid over five to 12 weeks on a payment plan.

Pollinators

Pollinate Energy wants not just their products, but their business model to be sustainable too. To this effect, they have trained and supported hundreds of local men and women, whom they call ‘Pollinators’, to sell and service the products in slum communities.

This gives them new skills and allows Pollinate Energy to capture key information and data on how they are making a difference on the ground. Every Pollinator has a 'business in a bag', including a smartphone, customer data and access to the products on consignment, so that their micro-business can flourish.

Each of cities Pollinate Energy operates in has staff to support the Pollinators and help them grow. In December 2017, they have taken another big step and founded the company Pollinate Power LLP. Pollinators now have the option to be employed and take up a stable salary and benefits. If they have ambitions to continue to develop their own business, they can continue as a franchisee and Pollinate Energy will provide ongoing business development support on request.

The 2017 Christmas Campaign has allowed the establishment of the Pollinate Energy Education Fund to support Pollinators in sending their children to a high-quality school. The fund provides qualifying Pollinators with the $200 tuition they are required to pay up front, at the beginning of the school year. Over the year, Pollinators repay 75 percent of the loan in interest-free monthly installments and keep the remaining 25 percent for other school supplies.

Impact stories

Five years ago, Laxmi moved her family to a slum of Hyderabad to find employment. Born into poverty, Laxmi has lived a challenging life with few opportunities. She earns only Rs 200 per day as a dhobi (washerwoman). Despite her low income, Laxmi bought Pollinate Energy’s product, the Sun King Boom, by entering their five-week payment plan.

The solar-powered light includes a digital FM Radio, MP3 player and mobile phone chargers. Pollinate Energy’s light allows her to work extended hours in the evenings and consequently increase her earnings. Her grandchildren are benefiting too — instead of straining their eyes under the dim light of a kerosene lamp and breathing in toxic gases, they can safely study under the bright solar lamp. Plus, the radio provides entertainment for the entire household.

Sandeep is a Pollinator in Lucknow. As a child, Sandeep wanted to join the army — a dream fuelled by an intense desire to serve his country. However, when his elder sister passed away, his family experienced great trauma, and Sandeep gave up his dream to work and support them financially. Being a Pollinator not only guarantees him a steady income, but inspires him to persevere on a daily basis.

For the urban poor

India’s urban poor, are often overlooked by government schemes, which tend to focus on rural poor. As urbanisation and migration in India increases, urban poor continue to be vulnerable, without access to quality housing, education and infrastructure such as electricity and sanitation.

They recently unveiled their first concept, an SUV, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). While it may not look all that different from a regular SUV on the outside, the interior features a sprawling display screen controlled by hand gestures – the first hint that Byton aims to make the car of the future.

“The future of design is digital,” Byton says on their website. Their electric SUV reflects that idea: it’s equipped with multiple screens allowing a driver to interact with the car. There’s an eight-inch tablet in the steering wheel and a 49 by 9.8 inch Shared Experience Display allowing for navigation, communication with others, or entertainment.

Voice recognition, biometric identification, and touch control also allow a driver to interact with the car. Byton’s Life Cloud Platform connects devices, apps, and data so drivers can work or be entertained during a trip. It’s a key-less vehicle – a facial recognition camera allows or denies access. Rotating front seats can turn inward 12 degrees.

That’s not to mention the car won’t be powered by polluting fuels. Instead, it can be equipped with a 95 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack that will allow drivers to travel 323 miles on one charge. The base version beginning at $45,000 will have a 71 kWh battery pack offering a range of 248.5 miles. The company says users can charge a battery pack up to 80 percent in 30 minutes.

Byton, which is the international brand of China-based Future Mobility Corporation, plans to bring the car to China in 2019 and the United States and Europe in 2020. Executives from Tesla, BMW, and Nissan started the company. Time will tell if the company will be able to bring their futuristic concept to production.

But if all goes according to plan, town homes built from shipping containers will begin rising up within a year on the site.

Named The Cotton Groves, the community is a new stock of affordable housing planned for the northern Collin County suburb.

North Collin County Habitat for Humanity purchased the nearly three-acre plot on the city's east side in November. Last month, McKinney City Council members unanimously approved plans for the 35-unit neighborhood development.

This map shows the site for the proposed Cotton Groves development. (City of McKinney)

'An expensive place to live'

Shipping containers for homes isn't a new idea, but it's a first for the Collin County nonprofit. Habitat's design advisory group, the JDL group, pitched the idea for the higher-density container home community because of their sturdiness, low-cost, quick-build and ability to house more people.

""Cost of living in McKinney is not low. It's an expensive place to live,"" McKinney Mayor George Fuller said. ""We have a lot of industry, a lot of businesses that depend on a labor force that quite frankly can't afford to live in the city.""

Each home will be made of four shipping containers to make-up a 1,280-square-foot home. The homes will feature three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a second-floor balcony and covered carport.

Habitat plans to sell the homes to people at 30 percent of their gross monthly income. Qualified applicants must have lived or worked in north Collin County for one year, currently be living in substandard housing and willing to contribute sweat equity to help build their home and others.

""The ultimate goal was to serve more families,"" said Celeste H. Cox, CEO of the North Collin County Habitat for Humanity. Currently, the nonprofit has about 170 people on its waiting list.

""We just can't build fast enough to serve the need for housing in Collin County,"" she said.

But there's still a ways to go before it's a viable community.

This architectural rendering shows what The Cotton Groves will look like. The 35-unit affordable housing development will be built from shipping containers by the North Collin County Habitat for Humanity. (North Collin County Habitat for Humanity)

Habitat still needs to raise $4.5 million to fund the project and plans to launch a capital campaign in a few months. The McKinney Community Development Corporation is contributing roughly $331,000 toward building the homes.

And remember that aforementioned abandoned home on the property? It's contaminated with asbestos and lead-based paint. Habitat has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for remediation funds to clean-up the home and then demolish it.

Then infrastructure — water, sewer and roads — needs to be built. There are plans for a prototype home to be built next to Habitat's office this spring to show off to donors and potential homeowners.

It's unclear how much the homes will cost, since it depends on their appraisal. But Habitat owners won't pay the full price. Currently, Habitat's three-bedroom home values in North Collin County range from $120,000 to $130,000, Cox said.

In Collin County, the median home price in the second quarter of 2017 was more than $319,000 — nearly 50 percent higher than the nationwide price of a typical home, according to the National Association of Realtors.

""There's just not a lot available in a price range families earning $20,000 to $40,000 a year can afford,"" Cox said. ""And the appraised values keep going up.""

'A constant challenge'

Already, Cox said the nonprofit has heard from a church and private landowners asking Habitat to build additional container communities.

""It is a constant challenge for cities to keep affordable housing,"" Cox said. ""As each of these cities reach build out, the need for more affordable housing — and just more housing period — becomes more desperate because there's less land to build on.""

In a Facebook post, McKinney residents weighed in on the project. Some praised the development's innovativeness, but others called the homes ugly and questioned their safety.

""Everyone talks about how we want more restaurants. We want more this. We want more that,"" Fuller said. ""Well, we need workforce, and we need to be able to house that workforce.""","Named The Cotton Groves, the community is a new stock of affordable housing planned for the northern Collin County suburb.

The Dallas Morning News Wine Panel found a dish that checks all those boxes: a hearty lentil vegetable soup. It's an earthy dish made with French lentils, which is a more savory variety that holds its shape and doesn't get mushy.

Teamed with a salad and garlic bread, this penny-wise meal is low in fat, high in fiber, and tips the scales for flavor. Pour the right wine -- nothing fancy needed -- and you've got a French bistro-style supper.

The wine panel tasted 20 wines with the lentil soup and found eight matches. Not surprisingly, French wines dominated our picks, but wines from Portugal, Italy and Macedonia also wowed us. Although our price limit was $20, we found several $12 to $14 wines that went toe-to-toe with pricier picks. Read on for the soup recipe and the wines that enhance it. If you're serving just four people, cut the recipe in half -- unless you're hoping for leftovers.

Domaine Pichot Vouvray 2015, France (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Domaine Pichot Le Peu de la Moriette Vouvray, 2015, France

This semi-dry, single vineyard wine comes from a reliable Loire Valley producer, and it's a bargain to boot. Showing intensity and roundness, it was the only white we tried that worked well with the lentils. ""It's rich and slightly sweet, and rounds out the acid in the soup,"" Tidwell said. He added that the wine showed ""an earthiness that matched the earthiness of the dish."" Schawel noted that the carrots and sweet elements in the dish worked well with the wine. ""It's perfectly complementary. There's a continuity of flavors between the wine and the food,"" Houser said. $14 and widely available at liquor stores and specialty supermarkets.

Macedon Pinot Noir (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Macedon Pinot Noir, 2015, Macedonia

Like it's southern neighbor, Greece, the Republic of Macedonia produces some great wines for the money. Among them is this easy-drinking pinot. ""It's not boring. It's got some identity and refreshing acidity,"" Schawel said. ""It's a lovely, clean windshield wiper for the tongue, especially after a bite of earthy lentils drizzled with the silken fat of olive oil,"" Uygur said. ""It's not a wine you meditate over, it's a wine you just want to drink. It's simple,"" Tidwell said. $18.99 at select Whole Foods Market stores, Central Market (Dallas and Plano stores), Pogo's, and McKinney Wine Merchant.

Zenato Valpolicella Superiore DOC, 2014, Italy

This medium-bodied red blend shows ripe red fruit with earthy and herbal notes. Botamer liked the wine's savory, herbal and floral qualities with the soup. ""This is what Valpolicella was built for -- simple peasant food,"" he said, noting that the wine was more savory than most of the wines we tried. ""It balances the flavors of the dish,"" Houser said. $12.17 at Goody Goody, Central Market, select Kroger stores, Market Street, Spec's, Total Wine, Pogo's, and select Whole Foods Market stores.

Domaine Guy Mardon ""La Rousseliere"" Touraine Pinot Noir, France (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Domaine Guy Mardon ""La Rousseliere"" Pinot Noir, Touraine AOC, 2016, France

Made of 100 percent pinot noir grown on a family estate, this Loire Valley wine shows cherry, raspberry and blackberry fruit and delicate tannins. ""The wine's sweet, juicy fruitiness picks up the sweetness in the carrots, and there's a touch of green note that plays with the celery,"" Uygur said. $19.99 at Pogo's.

Clos Siguier Cahors 2014, France (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Clos Siguier, Cahors AOC, France

Southwest France is the birthplace of malbec, the dominant grape in wines from the Cahors appellation. Clos Siguier's distinct terroir produces a lighter, brighter style of malbec than typical of Cahors. ""It's a well-made wine,"" Tidwell said. He pointed out that it had a supple texture and both fruity and savory qualities. The latter is a characteristic of French malbec. ""It's aromatic and simple, so it doesn't interfere with the dish,"" Schawel said. ""It's surprisingly clean for a malbec from France. It's a simple wine for a simple dish,"" Uygur said. $15 to $17 at Whole Foods Market and Pogo's.

Crasto Douro 2015, Portugal (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Quinta do Crasto Douro Red 2015, Portugal

A blend of four Portuguese grape varieties, this is an intensely fruity wine with good structure and more body than the other wines we chose. ""If you want a fuller-bodied wine [to pair with the lentil soup], this is it,"" Tidwell said. Houser picked up a mineral note in the wine, which he said helped it work with the dish. $17 to $19.99 at Spec's, Whole Foods Market, Pogo's, and Royal Blue Grocery.

Les Pouches Saumur 2016, France (Ron Baselice / Staff Photographer)

Les Pouches Saumur Red, 2016, France

Made of 100 percent cabernet franc, this light, earthy red from the Loire Valley's Saumur appellation is a bargain. Panelists were intrigued with this wine. Botamer picked up on the wine's herbal notes and ""hint of green,"" which he appreciated with bites of the food. ""It's the most herbal wine we've had [in this tasting],"" Uygur said. Schawel liked the wine's fresh, clean fruit, noting that the herbal note is an undertone. ""The wine plays a good supporting role with this dish,"" he said. ""The herbal tones in the wine match up perfectly with the herbs in the dish,"" Botamer said. Tidwell liked the wine's supple texture. $10.99 to $13.99 at select Whole Foods Market locations.

Dão Alvaro Castro ""DAC"" Red Wine Blend, 2014, Portugal

A blend of three Portuguese grape varieties, this light-bodied red shows bright red fruit with herbal and peppery notes. It was the last red wine that the panel sampled, and the favorite pairing for the lentil soup. ""I like the wine's brightness with the dish. It picks up the brightness in the food like no other wine we've tried,"" Tidwell said. ""It has a meaty note that works with the dish, Schawel said. Uygur noted that this was the only wine that brought out the hint of cumin in the dish. $14.99 at Whole Foods Market and Pogo's.

The major works will start early 2018, and the scheme will include full refurbishment of 62 currently vacant properties that the City Council has recently acquired from The Guinness Northern Counties, as well as facelift works to another 151 properties, with other improvements to the street and public areas, including works to the shared alleyways.

The project will be carried out by leading housing maintenance provider Wates Living Space and, when finished, the empty homes being refurbished will be managed by One Manchester – which will be affordable to Manchester people, using the Manchester specific definition of affordability.

The refurbishment works will bring the 62 empty homes up to decent homes standards with re-roofing works, energy efficiency upgrades, new fully-fitted kitchens and bathrooms, flooring and carpeting, with new heating system, lighting and power, along with alarm systems, and fire and smoke detection systems.

The facelift works to the front of properties will, where needed, replace all existing windows and doors with modern UPVC, improve guttering, and clean brickwork before repointing the mortar.

Alleyway improvements will include removing overgrown vegetation, new gating to all properties and essential repairs to the alleyway walls.

New traffic calming measures will be introduced following resurfacing works in the area, narrowing the carriageway that will be subject to a 20mph speed restriction. New trees will also be planted and new car parking developed.

One Manchester will also be purchasing a further five empty properties to further enhance the Ben Street area, which it will refurbish and manage.

As a second phase to the scheme, a vacant site currently owned by Manchester City Council on Alpine Street and Ilk Street will make way for around 55 new family homes, expected to start on site in two years.

Cllr Bernard Priest, Deputy Leader of Manchester City Council, said: “Renewing the city’s housing is a key element of our housing strategy, enabling us to use our resources most effectively to keep up with demand for high quality homes.

“We have been very successful in bringing Council-owned empties back in to use, but this scheme sees us acquiring long-term empties to make sure the city’s current housing stock is being utilised.

“The Ben Street area is already brilliantly serviced with great transport links, leisure facilities, school and shops, so we have an opportunity here to deliver a really successful neighbourhood.”","The Ben Street neighbourhood in Clayton – close to the Etihad Stadium and National Cycling Centre – holds significant potential to improve and expand the housing offer in the area says the City Council.

I had heard about these guys when they did research in this field of technology at the Technical University of Denmark DTU. In 2014, infinityPV was founded and now they mean business.

The patent originally granted to DTU is now owned by the new company, and anyone at DTU who had contributed their work to this technology were invited to buy a share of the company, resulting in 32 current owners.

A quick look at the company’s website surprised me. They actually sell a select range of products already. However, CEO Frederik C. Krebs doesn’t want to rush things. He has seen good ideas get smothered by greedy investors much too soon. Instead, they want to build the business foundation for a solid technology, and scale up from there.

On the infinityPV website, the world-renowned scientist professor and now CEO Frederik C. Krebs — in his ambitious goal of providing clean energy for the entire world — explains:

“Printed solar cells hold the promises of solving our energy needs — we have the technology, all needed materials are abundant, and we spend extremely limited energy producing them.

“I am really happy and look forward to dedicating all my time to the technology that I have worked on for 18 years. I want to make infinityPV realize the full potential of organic photovoltaics and printed solar cells and I want to enable anybody to manufacture, implement, and disseminate this technology in the right way.

Academia has lifted this technology, once we struggled for 1% efficiency and now laboratory records easily exceed 10%. However, there are problems ill-suited for University work. In many ways the discovery phase is over for the technology. We have high efficiency and good lifetimes, but we will continuously encounter challenges as we scale the technology. I believe these new challenges are best met in the private sector, where scientific ambition does not interfere with our focus.

“Organic solar cells are often viewed and compared to crystalline silicon which is a tremendously successful technology. Currently we cannot compete with the prices of installed capacity for silicon, but we must not forget that the true potential lies in the thin outline, flexibility, freeform design, and scalability. At infinityPV our reach is wide from fundamental materials, through equipment and machinery to real life products.

“I believe this wide scope is necessary until the technology has become more mainstream and more strong actors have entered the industry.

“I want to show that it is possible, because I know it is, and my dream is for others to join forces and together make a strong industry. If I where to guess were infinityPV is in 5 years, I would perhaps rather say where I think printed solar is. It will be huge.”

The polymer solar cells are non-toxic and at the end of their useful life they can be burned without creating contaminating byproducts. Small contents of silver can be recycled almost entirely.

One of the cool things infinityPV has available for order right now is the HeLi-on solar charger. Though small in size, it demonstrates quite well the potential of this technology:

Solar energy harvesting technologies are indeed rushing forward in many forms, and will have a significant impact on affordability of energy for all of us. Recently I happened to initiate a lively discussion about hydrogen vs battery storage, and I was relieved to learn that it is not at all a matter of one or the other, but a matter of all-in clean technology action to prevent rampant climate change. Printed solar cells are obviously a key contributor. And later on even more exotic technologies like nanopeapods with near-infrared active plasmonic hot-electron injection for water splitting may contribute. Yes! Thats a thing!

San Francisco has some great things going for it. There’s a mild climate, plenty of high-paying tech jobs coming out of Silicon Valley and the basketball team is pretty good, among many other cool things about the city.

One thing that’s not cool about San Francisco? The housing prices are higher than the Golden Gate Bridge. According to Zillow, the average price of a home in the area exceeds $910,000 – if you live in the city itself, the current home value is nearing $1.3 million.

While you might be able to afford that if you’re the star quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, Jimmy Garoppolo, or you’re a member of Train, not everyone has access to that kind of green.

Today, we thought we’d take a look at some cities where the cost of living is a little more affordable. After all, with prudent budgeting, there’s no reason you should have to save up for 15 years just for a down payment on the home you’re looking to buy.

Judging Affordability

In order to determine the affordability in any given city, a set of criteria is important. In compiling data for this story, we looked at roundups from Student Loan Hero and Business Insider with some Zillow housing data mixed in.

The three reports use slightly different criteria. The Business Insider article is essentially looking at the best cities where you can live comfortably by the 50/30/20 rule. The idea of this rule is that you put 50% of your income toward necessities, 30% toward discretionary spending and 20% to saving for the future Still, among the common factors being used are income, housing, healthcare, utilities and groceries.

With that, let’s look at some of the top affordable cities by region.

South

The South is often recognized as one of the nation’s biggest regions in terms of housing construction, so it’s a good place to start.

Memphis, Tennessee

A city that’s home to good blues and barbecue, Memphis has a pretty low cost of living; the median home listing price within the city itself is $82,000. This represents just 39.7% of the national average ($206,300, according to Zillow).

Beyond the housing part, Memphis gets high marks from Student Loan Hero for having transportation and healthcare costs more than 13% below the national average. It’s also 8% below the national average from a grocery standpoint. Finally, the unemployment rate sits at 3.9%, below the national average of 4.1% as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Knoxville, Tennessee

While not as big of a bargain as the homes of its Tennessee cousin Memphis, homes in Knoxville go for a median of $136,000, or 65.9% of the national average. While the median household income is a little low at just $34,556, the cost of living is 17.8% below the national average, and it boasts the lowest unemployment rate of any city on the Student Loan Hero list at 3.1%.

Also on the plus side is a grocery cost that’s 13.2% below the national average and transportation costs at 15.3% below average. Healthcare and utilities are also very affordable in comparison to most areas of the country.

El Paso, Texas

Right along the U.S. border with Mexico, El Paso gets a lot of sunny weather. It’s the most affordable city in the Business Insider report. Home prices are just 55.9% of the national average at $115,400. El Paso has the lowest necessary income needed to cover necessities with just 50% of their budget, leading to an annual salary of $40,204.

It has canyons, cliffs and caverns to explore as well as several nearby state and national parks.

Midwest

Several cities in the Midwest offer very affordable home prices. Let’s run through a few of them.

Springfield, Missouri

The list price for homes in Springfield is just 57.3% of the national average at $118,400. In the data sourced by Business Insider, it also has the lowest median monthly rent of any of the cities on the list (in case you’re not quite ready to buy yet).

Springfield is also near the Ozarks, which means there’s likely some good hiking in the area for enthusiasts, and it’s home to several universities, including Missouri State. Go Bears!

Detroit, Michigan

Detroit fell on some hard times for a while, but it’s a city on the rise. There’s quite a population of young people moving downtown and getting in on the ground floor of something special. Residents of the Motor City put the world on wheels and still do, but there’s also a growing number of high-tech companies looking to meet the needs of a 21st-century society.

Housing prices in the city right now average just 21.5% of the national average at $44,400. Thousands of new jobs have been created in the past year, and we have a brand-new sports and entertainment district downtown that’s second to none.

As a lifelong resident of the area, I might be a little biased, but there’s no city more passionate about its sports teams, either.

Another Michigan city made the Student Loan Hero list – Kalamazoo. According to the data gathered in the article, Kalamazoo’s cost of living is 19.5% below the national average by double digits in terms of grocery cost, utilities and healthcare.

Wichita, Kansas

Wichita has quite the presence from aircraft manufacturers that have flocked to the city. Its rent is just 63.2% of the national average. You need just $44,776 in annual income to live comfortably here under the 50/30/20 rule.

The area also has 33 museums, 28 art galleries and more than 80 miles of walking areas in the city parks. The Shockers of Wichita State are also a perennial pick to go far in the NCAA basketball tournament each year.

West

The West has some of the fastest rising home values, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some areas that are affordable.

Fresno, California

Fresno has a minimum take-home pay needed of $44,838 annually. It’s got some great local attractions, including being close to three national parks.

Although home prices are slightly above the national average, sellers are slightly higher than some of the other cities on the list in order to make up the difference.

Reno, Nevada

Median property value in Reno is more than $334,000. However, according to Forbes, the average household income is $57,613 and its unemployment levels are below the national average. According to the calculation of the Business Insider, it would only cost $46,269 a year to live there.

Healthcare and technology have joined gaming and entertainment over the last several years in order to become major parts of the local economy. Reno is also near the Sierra Nevada Mountains which could offer great opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts.

Northeast – Or At Least Rochester, New York

The one region that doesn’t get a lot of love on any of the lists we looked at is the Northeast. However, Rochester gets points for a lower cost of living. It costs $46,964 to live comfortably there, as opposed to $86,446 in the Big Apple.

Many industries have made their presence felt in the city, from tech and biotech to manufacturing and food industries. There are also two different universities in the area and many entertainment, music, art and sports options for everyone.

Affordable housing, homes for the homeless and mental health care were among major themes city staff found in the city of Bellevue’s 2017-18 Human Services Needs Update.

City officials present the needs update — a comprehensive set of data from needs assessments — every two years with the most recent unveiling on Feb. 5. The update will drive the Human Services Commission’s upcoming recommendations on which projects to fund during the 2019-20 budget funding cycle. Approximately $3.5 million was available in the Human Services fund in 2017-18 with $685,000 in Community Development Block Grant funding estimated for 2018.

Human Services usually receives about 100 applications for funding each biennium and funds about 70 percent.

“The work that has been done on this needs update is so critical to allocating funding where it belongs and where it’s impactful to the community,” Deputy Mayor Lynne Robinson said at a recent City Council study session. Robinson is the liaison to the Human Services Commission.

After surveying 400 Bellevue residents in February and March 2017 through phone and online surveys, as well as other small focus groups and providers, the city received feedback on issues from opioid use to services for older adults and people with disabilities.

Jude Mercer, the Human Services Commission chair, said the commission oversaw the planning and development of the needs update.

Although there were at least 11 areas where staff found ongoing trends, Alex O’Reilly, the city’s Human Services manager, highlighted five major themes at a recent council study session.

Affordable housing

“Housing continues to be a major issue facing the city,” Mercer said of the themes. “And, as you know, this goes beyond just discussions about a men’s year-round shelter. The needs and solutions cover a much broader range including areas that don’t always come up in the men’s shelter conversations, like low cost legal support for landlord or tenant issues, food support, access to affordable health care and help finding or maintaining employment. All of these things impact a person’s ability to maintain housing in crises and these areas can be the tipping point to homelessness or reasons to move out of our city.”

O’Reilly added that in 2017, 77 percent of survey respondents rated lack of affordable housing as the No. 1 community problem facing Bellevue. Just over 30 percent of Bellevue renters reported being cost burdened, meaning they are paying more than 30 percent of income on rent. And 16 percent said they were “severely cost burdened,” meaning they reported paying more than 50 percent of their income on housing.

O’Reilly said the perception for the need of affordable housing in Bellevue has been a top problem since the 1980s, but it has gone up a statistically significant amount between 2015-2017.

Homelessness

Homelessness is also a major issue. The Bellevue School District recently reported an increase of homeless students. In 2006-07, the district knew of 58 homeless students. During the 2016-17 school year, they reported 257.

O’Reilly said the Eastside winter shelters served 429 men, 192 women and 137 adults and 182 children in their family shelter in 2016-17. Although those are duplicated counts, O’Reilly pointed out the shelter for youth and young adults in Redmond recently expressed their need to expand along the Interstate 90 corridor due to increases in volume for that population.

Racial and ethnic discrimination

Although only 24 percent of survey respondents rated racial and ethnic discrimination in Bellevue as a major or moderate community problem, that was a statistically significant change compared to 2015 data in which only 17 percent rated it an issue. According to the survey results, 7 percent said racial and ethnic discrimination was a household problem. Many also had concerns related to immigration and not feeling welcome in the community.

Mental health/substance use disorder

“We heard great concerns from Bellevue School District staff and members in the community about the increase in serious mental health issues, including suicide ideation for youth and even some younger children,” O’Reilly said.

In 2016, 15 percent of eighth graders, 17 percent of 10th graders and 16 percent of 12th graders in the school district said they had contemplated suicide. Eastside Pathways has also created a mental health and well being committee to look at what can be done.

O’Reilly said agencies across the board from the Bellevue Police Department to health care providers reported an increase in adults with substance use issues, or addiction, to prescription opioids and heroin.

Transportation access

In a providers-only survey as part of the needs update, 70 percent said their clients need access to transportation. And almost a quarter of residents said lack of public transportation was a top household problem.

“Although transportation is not by definition a human service, it has shown up consistently as the biggest barrier to access of human services and, in some cases, employment,” O’Reilly said, noting this affects older adults who can no longer drive and low-income people who work odd shifts, are younger and do not have their licenses or those with disabilities.

The application deadline for those interested in Bellevue Human Services funding is April 10. Applications can be submitted online. For more information, applicants should contact Dee Dee Catalano, human services grant coordinator, at dcatalano@bellevuewa.gov or 425-452-6165.

After staff receive all of the applications, the Human Services Commission will make recommendations on which projects should be funded in the spring and summer. The City Council is then expected to vote on those recommendations in the fall.","Low Income Housing Institute’s 57-unit August Wilson Place apartments in downtown Bellevue includes affordable housing unites for households at 30, 50 and 60 percent of the area median income.

This week, the transportation agency’s board approved plans to solicit proposals for converting the Moscone Center Garage at 255 3rd St. into a structure with 650 hotel rooms and at least 100 units of permanently-affordable housing.

SFMTA will work closely with the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development and the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, OEWD spokesperson Gloria Chan told us.

Staff from participating agencies are finalizing the request for proposals and intend to issue it by the end of the month with the intention of selecting a developer by this fall, Chan said. The selection timeline depends in part on the number of proposals submitted, she added.

According to SFMTA, the garage is typically less than 55 percent utilized on weekdays and usually stays fairly empty on weekends. Last year, it generated about $2.3 million for the agency.

SFMTA considered retaining the site’s existing use, but because the parcel is zoned for 320 vertical feet, it determined that a parking garage with an average 53 percent occupancy “may not be the highest and best use of the space.”

The agency also decided a fully residential building wouldn’t capitalize on the site’s proximity to the Moscone Center, which is slowly undergoing an expansion, or generate the employment opportunities that a hotel could.

San Francisco’s hotel occupancy rate is nearly 84 percent, according to SFMTA, so it also determined there is a need for additional hotels in the area.

Interested developers will be asked to submit two designs: one with no off-street parking and one with a 200–300 space garage to replace the site’s existing 732 spaces.

According to the draft request for proposals, the affordable housing could be developed offsite, as long as it is within one mile of the Moscone Center Garage site and there are at least 133 permanently affordable units provided.

The design of the new development should be pedestrian-oriented and help activate the nearby streetscapes, according to the staff report recommending that SFMTA's board adopt the resolution.

The goal is to advance the Central SoMa Plan, which if fully implemented by 2040, could bring 9,600 new housing units and 25,000 new jobs to the area while decreasing the use of personal vehicles for travel by 40 percent, according to a study conducted regarding the potential of converting the site.

In July 2017, the site’s ownership was transferred from the Parking Authority to SFMTA to allow the conversion of the parking garage into a more productive space. SFTMA also gained authority of the Performing Arts Garage near the Civic Center to consider a similar development plan.

It’s not the first time the city has converted an underutilized property into a large-scale development.

In 2005, the city entered an agreement with the developer of the Hotel Vitale to build a 200-room hotel on a Muni bus layover yard at 8 Mission St., and the business will continue to generating ground lease revenue for the city until 2070 under the current lease.

The developer selected to convert the Moscone Center Garage will be responsible for all construction and associated costs, and would be required to pay an upfront deposit to cover the cost of staff and site review procedures.

There may be some city funding available to support the affordable housing component of the project, but developers will be asked to maximize other subsidies and external funding sources first, Chan said, in a process similar to other 100 percent affordable housing developments.

No public funds will be used to build the hotel portion, she added.

Once the site is converted, SFMTA would negotiate a 65-year lease with the development team with the option for a 34-year lease extension.","The SFMTA has decided a underutilized parking garage is not the best use of a site near Moscone Center that's zoned for buildings up to 320 feet tall.

DFA's conceptual proposal involves constructing a complex of housing, recreational and commercial facilities on the square-shaped Pier 40. The structure extends 250 metres over the Hudson River and currently houses car parking facilities and a popular football field.

By adapting the existing pier – which was built in 1962 and fallen into disrepair – the architecture studio is offering several responses to current issues in New York City, including a lack of affordable housing and resiliency to flooding due to climate change.

""We see so many projects going up in New York that are quick, chart-driven responses to serious problems,"" said DFA founding principle Laith Sayigh. ""These short-term resolutions will not safeguard the city from rapid changes in the environment or protect future generations of people.""

The concept envisions 19 cylindrical high-rises, wrapped in golden net-shaped window frames and planting. These would house a total of 450 living units, which would be sold at price points from affordable to luxury.

Ranging from 96 to 455 feet (29 to 138 metres) tall, the towers would be set in 11 clusters that the architecture firm based on analysis of the pier's structural base – comprising thousands of steel H-pile girders reinforced with concrete and sunk into the river.

The residences in the towers would be elevated 60 inches (1.5 metres) above expected storm surge levels as one of a series of ways to protect the complex from flooding caused by sea-level rise.

An elevated undulating pathway would wrap around the bases of the clusters, over a series of public pavilions. These would remain open until 2050, when water levels are expected to increase between 11 and 30 inches (30 and 76 centimetres).

But 50 years later, when the tidal river could be 50 to 75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 metres) higher, the pavilions would be completely submerged by water. In this scenario, the platform above would provide the new access for the complex.

""Beyond 2050, as regular flooding begins to engulf the coastline as we know it, the landscape deck transforms into a floating island with new pathways built to connect the evolved wetland ecosystem to Manhattan,"" said DFA.

Other resilient features of the complex include a series of pods that will float around the pier to act as a buffer to damage during storms.

DFA – which stands for D Form A – developed its Pier 40 proposal as part of a series of projects that imagine a better future of the New York City. The firm has also proposed a prefabricated timber tower for New York's Central Park that would both filter a contaminated reservoir and provide views over the city.","DFA's conceptual proposal involves constructing a complex of housing, recreational and commercial facilities on the square-shaped Pier 40.

Current owner L Catterton is reinventing the skin-focused, spa-inspired beauty brand as a whimsical mass market skin-care line aimed at Millennials.

All existing Bliss products are being phased out in favor of a completely reformulated line with new packaging, distribution and price structure.

The new Bliss is focused on trend-driven product innovation designed for Instagram. New prices are more than 50 percent less than the original line, and distribution will be sharply focused on the mass market.

Founded as a spa in New York’s SoHo by serial entrepreneur Marcia Kilgore, Bliss has gone through several iterations and owners since its early days in the mid-Nineties, including stints with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Starwood Resorts and Steiner Leisure. L Catterton purchased the brand as part of its 2015 acquisition of Steiner Leisure. By then, the sassy product line known for its signature sky blue and lemon yellow color scheme and tongue-in-cheek items like the Fatgirlslim cellulite cream had lost its way. Bliss’ heritage is as a young brand targeted at young consumers — but with a cluttered product lineup and a widespread distribution ranging from Kohl’s to gym bathrooms and hotels to Nordstrom, the brand hasn’t fostered any real relevance with the Millennial generation.

“The needs of the 18- to 34-year-old girl are different than they were 20 years ago,” said Meri Baregamian, chief executive officer of Bliss. “She [now] wants accessibility and experiential, efficacious products without paying an arm and a leg, and that’s what we’re going to offer her.”

Referring to the brand’s most recent primary channels of distribution — mainly Kohl’s — Baregamian said, “She cross-shops across various channels, and we definitely know she is not shopping in those destinations.”

Baregamian joined the company in 2016, shortly after L Catterton acquired Steiner Leisure, coming over from Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she ran the North American business for Soap & Glory, another Kilgore ideation that she sold to the drug chain.

One of the first things Baregamian did as ceo of Bliss was separate the product side of the business from the spa chain — there are 14 Bliss spas across the country, including three in Manhattan — moving the product headquarters to Los Angeles and the spa headquarters to Miami.

The new Bliss products — all 39 of them — will roll out to all Target and Ulta doors and online in March after launching on blissworld.com on February 27. Prices will range from $10 to $30. Most are facial skin care, with a heavy emphasis on masks and cleansers, but there is body care as well.

“The consumer’s biggest complaint was that our products were overpriced,” Baregamian said. “Especially when it comes to fun experimental skin care. When you look at what is happening across the industry — you know, ColourPop going into Sephora — the girls today don’t want to spend an arm and a leg if they don’t have to. Particularly that younger consumer, they want the product, but she doesn’t want to overpay.”

Baregamian told WWD she was able to lower prices because the brand hadn’t updated any of its manufacturing practices or switched ingredient suppliers in its more than 20 years in business. She is focused on using green technology, like solar-powered energy, where she can.

Several products are revamped versions of cult favorites, such as the Lemon and Sage Body Butter, Triple Oxygen Mask, Poetic Wax and Fab Foaming Cleanser, but formulated without microbeads, parabens, phthalates and sodium lauryl sulfates, along with other ingredients many Millennial consumers are wary of. Baregamian said the entire new line is free from such controversial ingredients.

The rest of the product assortment is new and feature playful textures and consistencies, like the Marshmallow Mask, Patrol Clay Soufflé Mask and Makeup Melt Jelly Cleanser.

Baregamian also has plans to revamp the spa business, though that is happening at a slower pace. Beginning in March, the old Bliss products will be swapped out for the new Bliss items, and any products from third-party vendors that are not cruelty-free will be phased out by 2019.","Current owner L Catterton is reinventing the skin-focused, spa-inspired beauty brand as a whimsical mass market skin-care line aimed at Millennials.

The proceeds will be used to finance developers of affordable housing as per the criteria specified in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, a government scheme that aims to ensure housing for all by 2022, IFC said in a disclosure.

L&T Housing Finance is registered under the National Housing Bank and serves the housing and real estate finance segments. As of 30 September, 2017, it held assets worth over $1.6 billion. Headquartered in Mumbai, L&T Housing Finance is present in 12 states.

The investment comes at a time when IFC has gone aggressive in tapping into opportunities in the affordable housing space. The segment has gained prominence on the back of the central government’s push to provide housing to all. Since the government stated its mission for housing in its first budget, it has taken a slew of policy and regulatory measures to add muscle to the segment.

In its latest budget, the government proposed to set up a fund dedicated for affordable housing while it granted infrastructure status to the segment last year.

Given the momentum instilled by the government, a host of investors has come forward to support affordable housing through financing to retail home loan takers and developers.

IFC has backed financial institutions that give money to both buyers and developers of affordable homes and also supported developers directly.

Recently, it agreed to create a platform worth $800 million with PNB Housing Finance to support affordable and green housing. It has also created a $800 million platform with HDFC Bank to push for opportunities in the affordable segment.

Previously, it had backed Ashiana Housing, Aspire Home Finance, Micro Housing Finance and Aptus Value Housing Finance with an aim to tap into low-cost housing segment.

Hintonburg community trades extra height for affordable housing

Article content A nine-storey rental building on Wellington Street West would be taller than land-use rules allow, but the councillor for Hintonburg and the community association are willing to make a trade: more height for two affordable units. It’s a small number of low-cost homes in the proposed 57-unit rental building at 979 Wellington St. W., but the deal between the community and the developer could inspire other builders and resident groups to negotiate affordable housing in new residential buildings. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Hintonburg community trades extra height for affordable housing Back to video City council’s planning committee on Tuesday approved the zoning and official plan changes to allow the development. There wasn’t a single voice of opposition from the public at the meeting, a rare feat in an urban community when a developer wants to change the rules for a property protected by a secondary plan. Kitchissippi Coun. Jeff Leiper said the planning report is more like an “essay on what did you do for your summer vacation,” since he worked on the deal over the summer of 2017.

Article content The property — which is currently home to law firm Beament Hebert Nicholson, whose principals are the development applicants — is at the corner of Garland Street, where Wellington and Somerset streets meet. There would be commercial units and three residential units on the ground floor and one underground level of mechanical “puzzle parking” for 15 vehicles. The building design has nine-storeys along the Wellington Street West, with the building stepping down to five storeys along Armstrong Street. The Wellington Street West secondary plan calls for a maximum of six storeys on the front part of the property, but if a developer offers some benefits to the community, the height limit can be increased to nine storeys. There was skepticism aired by the city’s urban design review panel last April over the building height after the first development plan went public, but the community was willing to negotiate. The community, developer and city came to a deal: the developer would have to pay $155,000 to reconstruct the field house at nearby Laroche Park, contribute $10,000 for cycling improvements on Armstrong Street, help gussy up the streetscape around the new building and provide public art. The architect, Richard Chmiel, reduced the height on the northern side of the building by one storey in response to public feedback. The developer also agreed to throw into the deal two affordable units, a unique cherry on top for a community concerned about the loss of low-cost housing. Leiper estimated the cost to the developer at $250,000, taking into account the revenue potential of market rent on those two units.

Article content The trick for the city will be holding the landlord, and any future landlords, to the deal. There could be a covenant on the land to make sure those two units are “affordable” under standards set by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp, Leiper said. The deal is “an example of what we can do when we have the leverage,” Leiper said. It’s also the city’s version of “inclusionary zoning.” The province is considering inclusionary zoning provisions to boost affordable housing in new developments, but so far not in the rental sector. Linda Hoad of the Hintonburg Community Association told the planning committee she hopes the affordable housing arrangement can be repeated in other developments. The community, however, is still concerned that allowing a taller building at a gateway property might lead to “gateway creep” in other nearby developments, Hoad said. The land-use amendments won’t go to council for final approval until the city finalizes the deal for community benefits. jwilling@postmedia.com twitter.com/JonathanWilling

The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it has identified an initial pipeline of Rs 3,000 crore ($466 million) for transactions across the main Indian realty markets.

Piramal Finance will follow the partnership approach for its investments in the affordable housing space.

The company provides both pure and preferred equity capital to top-grade developers looking to buy or develop land and in need of early-stage growth capital.

The firm may also explore acquiring land on its own and invite developers to participate on a joint development basis.

“While many players in the market are focused on providing equity or debt capital towards affordable and mid income housing, we believe that our ability to provide a comprehensive end-to-end solution – including both early stage equity as well as construction-linked debt – is truly unparalleled as it helps the developer achieve financial closure for the project on Day Zero,” said Khushru Jijina, managing director, Piramal Finance Limited and Piramal Housing Finance Limited.

He added that the firm’s ability to further drive sales through Brickex – its business-to-business (B2B) sales and research arm - and fund those sales through customised home loan products, specifically tailored towards salaried as well as self- employed end-users, acts as unique competitive advantage.

At the same time, through its proprietary wholesale loan book, PFL is able to sanction milestone-linked construction finance for developers so that they are able to achieve financial closure for their projects at the very outset.

As of September last year, PFL had a loan book of Rs 200 crore, originating primarily from its corporate lending relationship with real estate developers. It is targeting a loan book of Rs 15,000 crore by 2020.

The development comes at a time when affordable and mid-income housing has become a preferred segment for investors. Shunned for years, affordable housing has found many takers following a push by the central government.

Recently, HDFC Capital tied up with Prestige Estates to create a $390 million platform for low-cost housing in India.

Another active investor in the affordable housing segment is International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank. IFC recently committed capital for projects of north India-based developer Ashiana Housing.

Last September, PFL had announced its foray into retail housing finance through wholly-owned subsidiary Piramal Housing Finance Pvt. Ltd. Besides home loans, the company will offer construction finance and loans against property to small developers.

Piramal Finance’s assets under management stood at about Rs 50,000 crore as of September 2017.","Non-banking financial company Piramal Finance Ltd (PFL), a subsidiary of the diversified Piramal Enterprises Ltd, has set up a dedicated team to invest in affordable and mid-income residential projects across major metro cities in India.

A family-friendly take on fish en papillote (fish in paper), these tasty Thai-inspired parcels are a great way to get the kids involved in cooking.

Serves 4

Prep time 15 minutes

Cook time 20 minutes

Ready in 30 minutes

Ingredients

600g boneless, skinless, white fish fillets

3 Tbsp soy sauce

1 Tbsp finely grated ginger

1 clove garlic, minced

1 Tbsp sweet chilli sauce (preferably mild)

½ tsp runny honey

zest of 1 lemon

2-3 handfuls baby spinach leaves

½ capsicum, core and seeds removed, finely diced

½ red onion, thinly sliced

To serve

400g dried egg noodles (or your favourite fresh or dried Asian noodles)

1 head broccoli

1 lemon, cut into wedges

Method

Preheat oven to 200degC. Set aside an oven tray. Bring two medium-sized pots of salted water to the boil. Cut 4 large squares of baking paper and foil (measuring about 30cm x 30cm).

Lay foil squares on a flat surface and place a piece of baking paper on top of each. Pat fish dry with paper towels and cut any larger fillets in half.

Place some fish in the centre of each square, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sweet chilli sauce, honey and lemon zest, and spoon over fish. Top with spinach, capsicum and onion.

Wrap paper/foil into parcels by pulling two sides up and rolling together towards fish. Twist each end of the parcel tightly, ensuring sauce does not leak out.

Place on oven tray and bake for 15-18 minutes (depending on thickness), until fish is just cooked through and vegetables are still crunchy.

While fish is baking, add noodles to first pot of boiling water and cook for 9-10 minutes (or according to packet instructions) until just tender. Drain and toss with a little oil to prevent sticking. Cover to keep warm.

While noodles are cooking, cut broccoli into small florets and dice stem into 1cm pieces. Add broccoli to second pot of boiling water and cook for 3-4 minutes, until bright green and tender, then drain. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

To serve, open parcels (being careful of steam) and place noodles and broccoli to one side of the fish. Place a parcel on each plate and serve with a lemon wedge for squeezing.

19,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-to-save-energy-in-your-home-with-these-smart-affordable-upgrades,"Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",PBS NewsHour,"How to save energy in your home with these smart, affordable upgrades","My parents grew up in southern India during the 1960s and ’70s. Water was scarce in their villages and power outages common throughout the state of Karnataka, where they lived. To save water, they showered once a week. When the power went out, they studied by candlelight. Decades later, as I grew up on the outskirts of Chicago, my parents badgered me to shut off the faucets while brushing my teeth and turn off the lights when leaving the house. It was easy to take these things for granted.

Now an adult, I’m reminded of their stories as I take care of my own home and pay my own bills. In my head, I hear my mother’s voice: “Think about people when you use water or electricity,” she would say. “Not everyone has access or money to afford these things.”

In 2009, U.S. households spent an average of $2,024 on energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s most recent energy consumption data. (That’s a 6 percent rise from 1993, after adjusting for inflation.) Home appliances, such as refrigerators, water heaters, and heating and cooling systems, constantly guzzle up energy from the power grid. With recent tech innovations, we now have affordable, “smart” options that can help us be more eco-friendly without breaking the bank. Here, five experts provide their recommendations for smart home devices and upgrades that can improve our standard of living — and make our parents proud too.

Before you jump into any home renovation: Do a home energy audit and check your home energy score. Not all recommendations are necessary for everyone, so the U.S. Department of Energy recommends assessing your home’s existing structure, heating, cooling and hot water systems. And if you find these upgrades a bit too pricey, the DOE suggests looking into your state’s financing, incentives and assistance programs, such as the Weatherization Assistance Program. Private financing can also help foot the bill through programs like Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE).

Room-by-Room Upgrades

Kitchen

Let’s start in the kitchen, where appliances suck up the most energy. The best time to run, say, a dishwasher is just before you leave for work or during the day. (The same goes for appliances elsewhere in the home, such as a clothes dryer.) That’s when fewer people use these appliances, so it’s helping the grid work more efficiently. And that’s a no-cost change in habit that benefits everyone.

But if you want an upgrade, most major companies offer so-called smart kitchen appliances. For example, GE’s WiFi Connect smart fridge sends alerts to your phone if the temperature is too high, if it needs maintenance, if the door was left open, and most importantly, when it’s time to heat the water for your morning cup of coffee. GE’s smart dishwasher monitors cycles and notifies users of leaks. Whirlpool and Kenmore offer similar products with similar capabilities. These appliances can cost as much as $3,500.

Salt River Project could settle its three-year-old lawsuit with SolarCity by buying a massive battery from the company, now owned by Tesla Inc., and giving incentives to customers who want to put batteries on their homes.

SRP's board of directors voted Monday to negotiate a deal to end the lawsuit, which dates to 2015 when SRP OK'd new rates for customers with solar panels. The U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear oral arguments on the case this month.

SolarCity sued SRP in Arizona District Court, accusing the utility of ""anticompetitive and tortious conduct designed to eliminate solar competition.""

SRP tried unsuccessfully to dismiss the case on grounds of immunity — arguing that as a public utility it can't be charged with antitrust laws meant to deter monopolies. It appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The settlement would have Tesla drop its challenge to the solar rates and SRP drop its Supreme Court appeal of the immunity issue.

""I would like to request approval from you today to resolve this matter and resolve this litigation, moving forward to a more constructive relationship with Tesla on behalf of customers, both theirs and ours,"" Michael O'Connor, SRP's chief legal executive, said to the board of directors before the vote.

Tesla and SolarCity

Electric car maker Tesla merged with SolarCity in 2016. Its products include a Powerwall home battery that can pair with rooftop solar panels to supply most of a home's electricity. The price is about $7,000 to $9,000 with installation.

The settlement requires Tesla's approval, though the companies already have agreed to the broad terms, O'Connor said.

Tesla officials did not respond to requests for comments Monday.

""We've had advanced discussions with Tesla and their attorneys in terms of a potential resolution,"" O'Connor said following about 20 minutes of private discussions with board members. ""I'm not going to divulge what was discussed in executive session. There are several details that need to be worked out in terms of a settlement agreement.""

The deal could make it cost effective for customers in SRP's electric utility area to install solar. While hundreds of customers were installing solar in SRP's area before 2015, the rate changes reduced the rate of solar installations to a trickle because customers could not save as much money if they installed panels to generate their own power.

Solar customers on the rise

SRP had about 15,000 customers with solar when the new rates were approved in 2015. The next year, few people in the territory installed solar, but last year about 1,700 SRP customers did so. It has more than 17,000 solar customers now.

""We have been experiencing a steady increase in the number of applications for rooftop (solar), and with the potential for increased battery storage for residential customers, we would anticipate that trend continuing,"" spokesman Scott Harelson said.

Specific settlement details won't be available until Tesla approves the deal. The broad terms approved by the SRP board call for:

SRP to purchase a 25-megawatt battery that will be installed at the Agua Fria Generating Station in Peoria. O'Connor said SRP would pay market price. A battery that size can power about 6,000 homes at once and costs about $10 million, based on public statements from Tesla on pricing of other projects.

SRP to launch a ""limited"" incentive program for residential batteries. O'Connor said incentives would be given to customers, not Tesla, but did not cite a dollar figure.

SRP to launch a limited program for customers to test new demand rates. The rates, which are the subject of the litigation, charge customers a fee for the peak amount of electricity they draw from the utility each month.

The litigation to be dismissed with prejudice.

Each side to pay their own legal fees.

Notably, the settlement does not involve SRP repealing its demand rates, which spurred the litigation and prompted hundreds of protestors to attend SRP's hearings in 2015.

Frustration with the demand rates solar customers must pay has prompted new candidates to run for SRP's elected board of directors. Two solar advocates won election to the board in 2016 and five more are running this year.

The alliance was co-founded by both countries two years ago on the sidelines of the Paris climate summit to boost the use of solar power, countering the impact of climate change.



Dozens of country leaders, including many from Africa, attended the meeting in the Indian capital and emphasized the need for access to solar technology and concessional financing to address massive energy shortages in many of their sun-drenched nations.



Promising more loans and donations for solar projects by 2022, Macron stressed the need to remove obstacles in scaling up clean energy.

“We only have one planet, and we are sharing it,” he said.



Pointing to African women called “solar mamas” who are trained in India to use solar technology to light up homes and villages, Macron said they had continued their mission, even after ""some countries decided just to leave the floor and leave the Paris agreement"" — apparently alluding to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to quit the Paris climate accord.



“Because they decided it was good for them, for their children, their grandchildren. They decided to act and keep acting, and that’s why we are here, in order to act very concretely,” Macron said amid applause.



One hundred and twenty-one countries, situated between the tropics, have signed on to the ISA. Backed by the World Bank and other multilateral agencies, it aims to raise $1 trillion for projects by 2030 for a massive deployment of solar energy.



Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who is chairman of the African Union, pointed out that half the members of the ISA are African countries.

“The sunniest countries in the world should not lack for energy,"" he said. ""The fact that they do is an unacceptable irony.”



The solar alliance initiative is seen as a bid by India to be at the forefront of countries addressing the challenge of climate change — a departure from its stand some years ago that developed economies should cut their emissions more drastically, rather than pressure developing countries.



After the U.S. walked out of the Paris accord, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to abide by it. India, which is the world’s third largest polluter, is ramping up solar energy rapidly in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. The country plans to source at least 40 percent of its energy from renewables by 2030.



“If you want all of humanity to benefit, then I am confident that we all will come together and think like one family, so that we are able to bring unity in our objectives and efforts,” said Modi, advocating a solar revolution worldwide.

United Nations environment chief Erik Solheim, who attended the meeting in New Delhi, called the ISA a ""milestone"" in the fight against climate change and pollution.

Even though pursuing a double policy of promoting Hindutva politics and allowing hate politics targeting Muslims, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is on perpetual world tour, also talks about useful issues.

PM Modi has expressed his desire to make solar energy affordable so that common people could adopt solar energy use.

French President Emmanuel Macron is in India in connection with the first summit of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in New Delhi. ISA, headquartered in Gurgaon near New Delhi, is now a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation that was established following the Paris Declaration as an alliance dedicated to the promotion of solar energy among its member countries.

On his first visit to India after he assumed office in May 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron India and France inked, during just 11 minutes of their talks, total 14 pacts in the areas of railways, education and logistics support between the armed forces of the two nations. The leaders also assured to protect classified information, and discussed ways to enhance cooperation in civil nuclear power.

In this connection, speaking at the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented a 10-point action plan that includes making affordable solar technology available to all nations, raising the share of electricity generated from photovoltaic cells in the energy mix, framing regulations and standards, consultancy support for bankable solar projects and creating a network of centres for excellence.

Modi addressed the gathering first summit of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) held on Sunday and co-hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron saw 23 heads of nations and 10 ministerial representatives in attendance. Modi said that the Vedas consider the Sun the soul of the world and a life nurturer.

Today we need to look at this ancient idea to find a way to combat climate change. India will produce 175 gigawatts of electricity from renewable sources by 2022. Of this, 100 gigawatts will come from solar energy.

India has allowed France to use its airports for military purposes. Terms and conditions are not revealed. India’s greed or nuclear terror goods is well known.

Solar energy can have a variety of uses – agriculture, solar water pumps, clean cooking. The distribution of 28 crore LED bulbs in three years has saved $2 billion and four gigawatts of electricity. *The development of solar energy will not just lead to our prosperity, but will also reduce the carbon footprint of the earth. We must ensure that better and affordable solar technology is available to all. If we link other forms of energy to solar, the results will be even better. We need to encourage innovation in the solar energy sector to find different uses for it. For the good of humanity, we will have to move out of the personal and work as a family to achieve our aim”

PM Modi has also called for concessional and less-risky finances for raising the share of solar electricity in the energy mix and pledged to generate 175 gigawatts (GW) of electricity in India from renewable energy sources by 2022.

For achieving the ISA target of over 1,000 GW of solar generation capacity and mobilization of investment of over USD 1 trillion by 2030, Modi called for concessional financing and less-risky funds being made available for such projects.

India, PM Modiji said, will generated 175 GW of electricity from renewable sources including 100 GW from solar.

As a demonstration of India’s commitment to ISA, Modi said 500 training slots will be created for member countries and a solar technology mission will be started to lead R&D in the sector. ISA secretariat has to be strengthened and made professional, he said, adding that solar energy presents a permanent, affordable and reliable source for meeting energy needs of mankind.

To supplement solar energy generation, India has distributed 28 crore LED bulbs in the last three years which have helped save USD 2 billion and 4 GW of electricity, the prime minister said.

Going by his actions so far, like the black money and demonetization and GST – people of India gained nothing out of all this but the demonetization has harmed the people just like the GST move as they are burdened with more problems and expenditures. Modi considers Indian as being equals of Americans and they have to pay more as the impression goes.

The PM speaks of innovation in solar energy. But the government’s approach is anywhere but being innovative. When it comes to solar energy the government has a blinkered view of encouraging only photovoltaic and selling the country to China. Why is the government blind to CSP technologies which can be indigenized to a much greater extent and generate employment on a much larger scale?

All said and done, if solar energy is subsidized for the poor and common people that would benefit India in a great measure.

But will the USA, now a big strategic partner of India, allow subsidies to be given to the poor?

That is indeed the trillion dollar question.","PM Modi has expressed his desire to make solar energy affordable so that common people could adopt solar energy use.

Gaudenzia, a nonprofit organization focused on addiction recovery services, is providing 24 units of permanent supportive housing for adults, primarily women, recovering from addiction and their families in Philadelphia.

Tioga Family Center, which was completed at the end of October and expected to be fully leased by the end of this month, provides substance-free, affordable housing and on-site services aimed at households transitioning from treatment to independent living.

“This assists women with treatment in their recovery process and gives them a helping hand in that process and for the long term,” says David Slinger, director of operations at Gaudenzia.

Gaudenzia primarily operates drug and alcohol treatment centers and shelters. However, finding that a lack of stable housing has been a determinant factor in relapses for its clients, especially for women, it moved into the permanent housing space. Next door to the development is another 22 units of affordable housing at Tioga Arms, and on the other side is a treatment facility.

“It’s a continuum of care in that women can come in at the beginning of their recovery period when they’re really just trying to get themselves clean and sober and move through Gaudenzia’s programs in that neighborhood,” says Emily Perschetz, a project manager with Stone Sherick Consulting Group, the development consultant on the project.

Cecil Baker + Partners designed Tioga Family Center with families in mind. All units are furnished, with accent paint colors on the walls and warm and friendly finishes.

Amenities include play equipment for both younger and school-age children as well as a half-sized basketball court. The development also has a community room with a kitchen, a dedicated child-care space, and three classrooms that overlook the outdoor green space.

“Gaudenzia has an amazing environment to really help the residents get on their feet, and they’ve had great success,” says Nancy Bastian, a partner at Cecil Baker + Partners. “I love when housing can be proven to be so critical to people. Having a safe environment to live in just means the world.”

The development also is constructed with rigorous energy-efficiency standards. It complies with the requirements of Enterprise Green Communities as well for a lowered Home Energy Rating System Index Score. The building is highly insulated with triple-glazed windows, energy-recovery units in each of the apartments, and LED light fixtures.

“The hope is that tenant’s utility bills will be very low and keep apartments quite comfortable with very little heating and cooling,” says Bastian. “That should be a really nice benefit for the residents.”

The units serve residents earning less than 60% of the area median income. In addition, the Philadelphia Housing Authority provided vouchers for all 24 units.

The $10.1 million development was financed primarily with low-income housing tax credits allocated by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency and equity provided by National Equity Fund. Additional financing included permanent debt from Community Lenders; Affordable Housing Program funds from the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, New York, and Pittsburgh through member banks Citizens, M&T, and PNC; and money from The Reinvestment Fund, the Housing Opportunities Program Philadelphia, and private foundations.","AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE Affordable Housing for Adults Recovering From Addiction Opens in Philadelphia Tioga Family Center provides 24 units of permanent supportive housing with wraparound services.

The Solana Beach City Council on March 14 voted 3-1 to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) calling for designs to redevelop the 1.3 acres at 635 S. Highway 101. The March 26 RFP will cap construction at two stories no taller than 27 feet, and assumes that the housing will be built in the city hall’s parking lot, along with a parking structure to replace the lost spaces and provide parking for the new housing. The parcel is zoned for 14 housing units; a state density bonus could allow up to 19.

While the RFP is written for city hall to remain, three of four councilmembers showed interest in changing those terms to give developers wider latitude in crafting their proposals.

“I would prefer more flexibility as it has to do with the [city hall] structure, and keep it, or not keep it, or build over it, whatever—just all possibilities that you can envision for this property,” said Councilwoman Judy Hegenauer. “I think it’s a brilliant idea.”

Razing city hall and redeveloping the entire site could increase the housing total to as many as 28 units, depending on various factors—including setbacks, mixed-use requirements and the number of units designated affordable—that won’t be known until designs come in, said City Manager Greg Wade.

Flexibility may yield better proposals, but Councilman Dave Zito urged the city not to overstate its willingness to demolish the 14,000-square-foot building.

“People can get creative, but don’t expect us to come up with $16 million to rebuild city hall like Del Mar,” he said.

Submissions are due June 4. The city is not obligated to approve any of the proposals. If viable projects emerge, the council would select a developer at its Sept. 12 meeting.

The potential project would be Solana Beach’s second sizable effort this decade to expand its scant stock of affordable housing. The site is one of five candidates identified in the housing element of Solana Beach’s General Plan, along with the train station, the Solana Highlands apartment complex and two city-owned parking lots.

One of those parking lots has been eyed since 2009 for a project known as The Pearl. The city council in April 2014 approved the plan to develop the lot at 500 S. Sierra Ave. into a mix of uses topped with 10 “very low-income” apartments—reserved for tenants who make 50 percent of the county’s Area Median Income. Neighbors along South Sierra immediately sued and took their case to state appeals court, where the city prevailed in December 2016. Despite a $2 million loan from the city, the $6 million project has stalled for lack of financing.

Solana Highlands, a 47-year-old apartment complex on Nardo Avenue, is bogged down in preliminary planning stages to redevelop the 194 multi-family units into 260, more than 50 of which would qualify for designation as affordable. A plan unveiled in 2015—which would increase the buildings’ height limit from 30 feet to 68 feet—met stiff opposition from the city’s View Assessment Committee. Alternative designs have yet to be submitted.

Faced with similar affordable-housing shortages throughout California, state officials have been pushing more and more mandates onto local governments, said City Attorney Johanna Canlas, including a requirement to explore the viability of city-owned property.

Nonetheless, Mayor Ginger Marshall voted against the city hall RFP.

“I just don’t like state government shoving this down our throats,” she said.

Marshall has voiced concern before about South Sierra becoming an “affordable housing row,” and last week reiterated her disdain for clustering below-market projects close together. Building The Pearl’s 10 units followed by even more units one block to the north, she warned, would incur the wrath of the scores of residents who fought so hard against The Pearl.

“I’ve had conversations with those property owners, and there’s a lot of negativity and opposition, I should say, to putting a second affordable housing project on South Sierra,” Marshall said.

But Zito countered that not having a state-certified housing element, as happened to Encinitas, would jeopardize Solana Beach’s ability to secure state funding along the lines of the $500,000 used to upgrade Stevens Avenue last year.

“Construction prices are really high right now, the market’s different, who knows what’s going to happen, but it is our responsibility to put this [RFP] out there because it’s part of our housing element,” he said. “… We have limited land. We’ve got to make use of what we have, and these projects can be nice if they’re done correctly.”

Compounding the decision’s gravitas was the once-per-decade update of the county’s projected housing needs. To the dismay of elected officials from cities across the region, the San Diego Association of Governments announced a few days earlier that 171,685 housing units will need to be built during the upcoming housing cycle (2021 to 2028). That breaks down to 21,000 new units per year, three times the rate San Diego County has allowed over the past decade, “and probably a much higher rate than that in Solana Beach if we’re going to try to stay compliant,” Zito said.","After a decade of minimal progress toward state mandates, Solana Beach this summer will consider proposals for building below-market housing alongside—and possibly, in place of—city hall.

The social mix or integration of affordable houses and services is a critical principle for new urban planning in order to ensure sustainability, an official has said.

Vincent Kitio, chief of the urban energy unit at the UN agency for human settlements and sustainable urban development, was yesterday presenting strategies to integrate sustainable city planning into a roadmap of a sustainable energy future for East Africa on the final day of the first Sustainable Energy Forum for East Africa 2018, in Kigali.

In urban planning a social mix refers to the availability of houses in different price ranges and tenures in any given neighbourhood to accommodate people with different incomes.

Kitio, who works for UN Habitat’s Urban Basic Services Branch, was categorical that things are being done the wrong way.

He advised that developers “should not just build for the rich because you will create insecurity as people will go to where they can afford.”

The time for owning land, individually, in Africa is over, he said, emphasising the importance of proper and better planning to cater for the social mix.

He said: “We are not planning for slum communities properly. Look at it carefully; in new urban housing there is no provision for the housekeeper, the driver, the cleaner and others. There is need to ensure that everybody is included, and it is about government being involved.”

UN-Habitat supports countries to develop urban planning methods and systems to address current urbanisation challenges such as population growth, urban sprawl, poverty, inequality, pollution, and congestion.

UN-Habitat’s five principles for new urban planning also include: adequate space for streets and public space in an efficient street network (50% for public spaces and 50% for buildings); mixed land use (combining economic and residential activities); adequate density and compact pattern; and connectivity or linking different cities spaces.

During the session on sustainable city development in East Africa, Kitio also said that promoting sustainable cities requires a multi-sectoral approach including six priorities areas: urban planning with focus on density; energy efficient building (green building); urban mobility with reliable and affordable public transportation; clean energy generation from local sources; waste management and resource recovery (efficient waste municipal waste management); and resource efficiency in commercial and industrial sectors, as well as in the generation and transportation of energy.

According to Kitio, for appropriate architectural design there is need to design architecture that is suitable to the local context and embrace environmentally sound building design strategies.

Tareq Emtairah, the director of UNIDO’s department of energy, observed that part of the challenge goes back to the degree at which local governments are empowered to deal with the planning challenge.

Dima Reda, president and co-founder of Nataij Consulting, a boutique consulting firm, highlighted challenges for urban sustainability, including “constraints of underdeveloped transportation infrastructure.”

Her baseline study of urban sustainability in the East African Community cited issues such as high cost of doing business and lack of infrastructure or technology for basic services as some of the other challenges for urban sustainability in the region.

She said: “It is also important to facilitate a dialogue among local, national, and regional governments and connect officials in specific ministries and cities to co-develop project proposals.”

One of the biggest challenges facing the global water supply is quality. Low-cost solutions to improve water quality could greatly benefit communities around the world

Most of us are used to turning on a tap and water coming out. We rarely question whether this will happen or whether the water is clean enough to bathe in or drink. Though the process of maintaining water quality is practically invisible to most of us, removing bacteria and contaminants from water requires a lot of effort from both humans and treatment systems alike.

Mohammad Alizadeh Fard, a doctoral student in Michigan Tech's Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and Brian Barkdoll, professor of civil and environmental engineering, are developing low-tech, affordable solutions to improve water quality in municipal water tanks, and to remove micropollutants from water using renewable materials.

Their research has been published in three journals--Journal of Hydraulic Engineering (DOI: https:/ / doi. org/ 10. 1061/ (ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001459), Journal of Molecular Liquids (DOI: https:/ / doi. org/ 10. 1016/ j. molliq. 2017. 11. 039 ), and Colloids and Surfaces A (DOI: https:/ / doi. org/ 10. 1016/ j. colsurfa. 2017. 08. 008 )--with a fourth paper pending review. Their work proves that solutions to vexing problems can be elegant in their simplicity.

An Elegant, Low-Tech Solution

In communities around the nation, there are large water-storage tanks for municipal drinking use. Many such tanks have a line in to supply the tank with water, and a line out. However, these lines in and out are frequently at the tank bottom. Though the tanks are refilled daily, the water at the top of the tank is never used and becomes stagnant. Even though many municipal water supplies are treated with chlorine, the top water layer can become a breeding ground for bacteria, algae or waterborne illness, such as giardia and E. coli.

""If the water is not moving, (bacteria and algae) can start growing,"" Barkdoll says. ""It may not be originally from the water source; it could be from the air. Or the chlorine in the stagnant water could be used up after some time. You want the water to keep moving, especially in hot regions of the country.""

But if there's a large fire in the community or surrounding countryside, the water tank is drawn down significantly, and people then drink the stagnant water.

""So, when you have a fire, all the stagnant water goes out to everybody's house,"" Barkdoll says. ""After a fire, people get sick, that's a known thing. That's the problem that we're trying to fix.""

To remedy the problem, Alizadeh Fard and Barkdoll created shower head-like attachments that can be added to new or existing water tanks for minimal cost. Adding a PVC-pipe sprinkler at the top of the tank, and a reverse sprinkler at the bottom of the tank, injects water into the system and keeps all the water circulating. Alizadeh Fard and Barkdoll published their article on this simple but effective system in the Journal of Hydraulic Engineering March 15. They hope it will be a low-tech solution easy for water quality managers to adopt.

Unseen Menace: Micropollutants

But organic contaminants are not the only source of contaminated water. Few municipal systems are equipped to handle micropollutants--such as pharmaceuticals, hormones, microplastics, nanoparticles in socks and synthetic fleece, and antifungal compounds--even types of industrial waste that are present in very low concentrations. Despite the small amounts--mere micrograms--of these pollutants in water, they still have carcinogenic effects on humans and aquatic creatures. Retrofitting treatment plants to filter for micropollutants is expensive, leading Barkdoll and Alizadeh Fard to explore potential solutions.

""These contaminants have long-term effects on health,"" Alizadeh Fard says. ""Most of our treatment plants have not been designed to remove them from water, so it's important to find a reliable solution to address the problem.""

The researchers struck on the idea of adsorbing pollutants from water. Adsorption occurs when molecules essentially stick to a surface. The first method Alizadeh Fard and Barkdoll tested was to use polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles to adsorb Tonalide (used to mask odors and often found in detergents), Bisphenol-A (better known as BPA, used to make plastics clear and tough), Triclosan (an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent used in cleaning products that is now banned), Metolachlor (an herbicide), Ketoprofen (an anti-inflammatory) and Estriol (an estrogen supplement).

The polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles were most effective at adsorbing Ketoprofen and BPA, removing the pollutants in 15 minutes with 98 and 95 percent effectiveness, respectively, with only 0.1 milligram of the adsorbent.

But what happens once the nanoparticles have done their work? Because the adsorbent is magnetic, the researchers can use magnets to remove the nanoparticles from the water.

Barkdoll and Alizadeh Fard say that one of the key components of their work is that the adsorbents are reusable once rinsed with a restorative methanol solution. In the lab, the polymer-coated nanoparticles were restored and used again five times before seeing decreased effectiveness.

The researchers have also used magnetic carbon nanotubes and activated carbon as absorbents. During the lab trials, the polymer-coated nanoparticles have so far proven to be the most efficient.

Next Steps: Validating the Research Empirically

The researchers say the next phase is to scale-up for use in water treatment plants. Removing micropollutants from water using technology that is sustainable and affordable offers the potential to protect human and aquatic health without expensively retrofitting treatment plants.

Unfortunately, some of humanity's greatest problems are those of their own making. But pioneering and validating technologies to solve human-created problems has long providence and will no doubt continue.

""Civil and environmental engineers will have to handle whatever society hands to us,"" Alizadeh Fard says. ""We will have to remove nanoparticles, and other things such as opioids. It's a topic we have to discuss politically and socially as well.""

###","Low-cost solutions to improve water quality could greatly benefit communities around the worldMost of us are used to turning on a tap and water coming out.
Mohammad Alizadeh Fard, a doctoral student in Michigan Tech's Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and Brian Barkdoll, professor of civil and environmental engineering, are developing low-tech, affordable solutions to improve water quality in municipal water tanks, and to remove micropollutants from water using renewable materials.
But if there's a large fire in the community or surrounding countryside, the water tank is drawn down significantly, and people then drink the stagnant water.

28,https://www.startribune.com/ecovillage-provides-infusion-of-affordable-green-housing-in-north-minneapolis/477137363/,"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Minneapolis Star Tribune,"EcoVillage provides infusion of affordable, green housing in north Minneapolis","Detrick Cheairs gave a tour of his brand-new, two-bedroom apartment in north Minneapolis’ Hawthorne EcoVillage. It is a modest corner unit with large windows and an open floor plan.

For Cheairs though, his unassuming new home feels a bit like divine intervention — a glimmer of hope after homelessness knocked his little family off their feet.

“We are so blessed,” Cheairs said repeatedly. “There is more than enough from me and my daughter.” He and his 7-year-old daughter, De’Liyah, were forced to sleep in shelters last fall after a breakup and then financial turmoil left them homeless.

Two days before Thanksgiving, they moved into their new apartment.

They are one of 75 families now living in the Eco­Village, a new environmentally friendly, four-story apartment and townhouse development built and managed by Project for Pride in Living (PPL). The nonprofit developer and social service provider has been investing in affordable housing in a four-block area of the Hawthorne neighborhood for more than a decade. The idea behind the venture is that safe, affordable homes are essential to improving student performance, which leads to better-paying jobs, happier families and more vibrant neighborhoods.

“That stability of having a dependable, decent place to live — everything springs from that,” said Paul Williams, president and CEO of Project for Pride in Living.

EcoVillage, an $18 million, 75-unit affordable housing community, opened in January along Lowry Avenue in north Minneapolis.

The $18 million EcoVillage is PPL’s largest single investment in the neighborhood, and relied on nearly a dozen financing partners including the city of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Units range in size from studio apartments to three-bedroom townhouses, with rents from $670 to $995 a month. They are available to residents making no more than half the area’s median income.

The group’s work is taking on a new urgency as razor thin rental vacancy rates, rising rents and home prices are making large swaths of housing out of reach for those with modest incomes.

“We had over 600 inquiries for this property before we even officially opened up application for the 75 units,” Williams said. “We have seen the demand for affordable rental housing continue to increase and intensify. That low-to-moderate income housing stock has been bought up, slightly upgraded and the rents are really jacked up.”

The average rent for a two-bedroom unit in the Twin Cities is about $1,200, but the median household income for that neighborhood is less than $30,000, said Danyika Leonard, a manager with the education-focused nonprofit Northside Achievement Zone.

“Our families do whatever they can to make sure roofs are over their babies’ heads, but it can sometimes feel impossible,” Leonard said.

An apartment with a comparatively affordable $655 monthly rent has allowed Cheairs to turn his attention back to work, parenting, sports and even nutrition.

Northside Achievement Zone, which partners with PPL, selected 11 of the Eco­Village families, including the Cheairses. Leonard said they also believe that a stable home is pivotal to improving student performance.

Cheairs, a welder, is nearing the end of his probationary period at a new job. He coaches youth basketball. De’Liyah is on a basketball team and he is trying to expand his cooking skills.

He said he’s motivated by his daughter, at one point hugging her photo to his chest.

“This is my heart,” he said.

A new vision

PPL spent years working with neighbors to design the EcoVillage at 617 Lowry Av. N., near Lyndale Avenue. The building, erected on an empty lot, has a modern look, but the facade includes brick, a nod to much of the neighborhood’s architecture and design. A row of townhouses behind the building act as a transition into the neighborhood of mostly single-family houses.

Andrew Bornhoft, housing administrator with the Hawthorne Neighborhood Council, said he’s pleased with PPL’s commitment to the neighborhood and its work to help some of the area’s families that are vulnerable to rising rents. In addition to the new apartments, PPL has built or rehabbed more than 20 single-family houses in a four-block area of the neighborhood.

‘We find it very positive’

Other nonprofits, including Habitat for Humanity, have also built or rehabbed homes in the area. That investment aids families, builds prides in the community and lowers crime, Bornhoft said.

“We find it very positive and exciting,” Bornhoft said. “It’s an example to other developers about what can get built in this community.”

The EcoVillage includes a playground, outdoor picnic area, underground heated parking and a state-of-the art rainwater infiltration system. The roof has been seeded with grass. Water that doesn’t get soaked up is funneled into an underground holding tank and will be used to water a series of rain gardens on the property.

“We are trying to do away with the myth that low income housing means low-quality tenants,” Bornhoft said.

The building is energy efficient and can be outfitted with solar panels. During construction, crews relied on techniques to reduce waste.

“We had to cut down a tree on site and we made it into furniture,” Williams said.

The building is also designed to promote a healthy lifestyle for residents. PPL already manages a community garden on a lot adjacent to the EcoVillage. The new building includes a secure bicycle storage room and a fitness center. The building includes wide sweeping stairways while the elevators are tucked out of sight, to encourage walking.

Founded in 1972, PPL manages 1,300 affordable housing units across the Twin Cities. In addition to the Hawthorne neighborhood, PPL has worked extensively in the Phillips neighborhood in south Minneapolis.

Said Williams, “A tougher inner city neighborhood can be a place of promise and opportunity.”","The nonprofit developer and social service provider has been investing in affordable housing in a four-block area of the Hawthorne neighborhood for more than a decade.

But efforts to clean those places up have indicated another problem—a lack of affordable housing.

Soon after Cheyenne Mayor Marian Orr took office in 2017, she formed the Fight the Blight committee.

Orr said there are several abandoned properties in the community that have been taken over by all kinds of things, “by squatters, and drug dealers, and other criminal activity, raccoons, skunks… Nobody wants an abandoned property next to theirs, or next to their grandmother’s, or their mother’s.”

Orr asked the committee to come up with a list of areas in town that need to be addressed. At the top of the list? A trailer park in south Cheyenne.

“This particular trailer park has not been really held accountable for meeting codes,” said Orr.

The city was concerned with four trailers in the park after an inspection revealed no connection to water, sewer, gas or electric services.

The trailers weren’t always occupied, though. They used to be boarded up. Mayor Orr said last year when the park came under new management, landlord Robert Wink decided to put them to use.

“He knew of some people that were in need of homes, and he’s has a very good heart and thought that perhaps unboarding these structures and allowing individuals and families to move into these units was somehow better than their current situation,” said Orr.

Landlord Robert Wink declined multiple requests from Wyoming Public Radio for an interview.

Mayor Orr said because the trailers were not fit for human beings, the city posted notices of code violations on the four trailers. Residents would need to bring their homes up to code, or they would have to find somewhere else to live.

But the problem wouldn’t be solved if tenants simply left the park.

“I think that is absolutely the root of all of this, is a lack of affordable housing here,” said Lori Kempter.

She’s executive director of Family Promise, the sole family-only shelter in Cheyenne.

According to the Wyoming Business Council, there’s a housing shortage in every county in the state. To meet housing demands, Cheyenne—a city of about 64,000 people—would need 12,000 more units.

Kempter said people underestimate how many experience homelessness in the area. That’s because it looks different in Wyoming. Often times it’s people crashing with family or in motels and their cars.

“We serve usually between 15 and 20 families a year with emergency shelter and the majority of the last 12 months we have operated with a waiting list of 15 families at a time,” said Kempter.

The same goes for the other homeless shelter in Cheyenne, COMEA. Executive director at COMEA, Robin Bocanegra, said it is almost always operating at full capacity.

“We always end up with this pocket of people that because of the lack of services there’s just nowhere for them to go,” said Bocanegra.

She added those limited services would help people become more self-sufficient.

“And it’s really hard for us then to find, or to make room, for new people that are experiencing homelessness, because we are full of the folks that we have nowhere to place them,” said Bocanegra.

COMEA and Family Promise each receive about $10,000 a year from the city, and some of that money is set to run out in 2019. Bocanegra said there could be more beds and services provided if they had more funding.

“$10,000 is nothing. When I look at how many people we’re taking off the streets and trying to help them, that’s a community issue,” said Bocanegra.

Both shelters said they would like to see the city take a greater interest in combating homelessness. Mayor Marian Orr sees things differently.

“I don’t believe that it’s up to city government to solve it,” said Orr. “Because it’s a much larger social issue and we simply don’t have that bandwidth and that capability within city government.”

Lori Kempter with Family Promise said the problem is bigger than the local government. She says it’s Wyoming’s weak landlord-tenant laws that cause people to live in the conditions seen at the trailer park in south Cheyenne.

“They’re not choosing to live in conditions that are not meant for human habitation and that don’t have the same basic necessities that you and I have,” said Kempter. “They’re doing that because they have nowhere else to go. So for a landlord to be able to legally rent places out to people that don’t have all of those necessities, that’s a really bad law.”

It’s not clear what will happen to the trailer park in south Cheyenne. Lori Kempter said Family Promise will be stopping by this weekend to hand out flyers with information on community resources. She said if residents do have to vacate in the future, she hopes there’s room at the shelter.","Soon after Cheyenne Mayor Marian Orr took office in 2017, she formed the Fight the Blight committee.

In Guernsey, Wyoming—a possible solution to the affordable housing problem that’s plaguing many parts of the nation, including the Mountain West.

There’s not a single traffic light in Guernsey, Wyoming; only stop signs and two main roads—U.S. Highway 26 and Wyoming Avenue.

Doug and Chuck Frederick have lived in Guernsey their entire lives.

“My great-grandad was a soldier at old Fort Laramie, homesteaded up Flaming Canyon in 1879. We’re the fifth generation, so we’ve been here a long time,” said Chuck.

Doug said it’s a friendly town.

“We used to know everybody, but times are changing!” he added.

One of those changes is affordable housing in this small town of about 1,100 people.

Right now it costs an average of $250,000 to buy a house in Guernsey. Bruce Heimbuck said that’s what inspired the group to take action.

“We decided going in that we weren’t going to make money,” said Heimbuck. “But we were going to use our money to try and at least make a little bit of a difference.”

So, over the last few years, Heimbuck along with Chuck and Doug Frederick and three of their peers have met on a regular basis in the backroom of Wyoming West Realty to tackle that problem. They call themselves Growing Guernsey, or G2.

This was their idea: the six of them would approach the bank and ask for a line of credit. Each would offer $20,000, either inland they owned, or the cash itself as collateral.

“It was definitely an interesting first discussion,” said Dan Sissin, the President at First State Bank in Guernsey.

“Obviously if you’re in business, you’re looking to make money,” said Sissin. “But they're more concerned with helping clean up some areas in town and have some new housing for people.”

Sissin said the bank approved a line of credit for $120,000 and G2 used it first to buy an old apartment building at auction. G2 member Bruce Heimbuck said the building was cheap because it was basically stripped down to the studs.

“We turned around and sold that at our cost to a local contractor who then completely finished it off and it now has ten apartments,” said Heimbuck.

That’s ten rental apartments that are now affordable housing in the community. The group then turned their attention to building a house from scratch. Heimbuck said first they had to find the right lot to build on.

“Because lot costs are a major factor in housing,” said Heimbuck. “And you can’t do affordable housing if you don’t have an affordable lot.”

Finding an affordable lot was one challenge. Chuck Frederick said finding one that the owner was willing to sell was another.

“We still have a lot of vacant lots, but some people are not willing to release them and sell them,” said Chuck. “Some of them are, ‘No, I’m going to give it to my son or daughter. We’re going to keep it in the family.’”

Eventually, success! They found a lot, hired contractors, and built their first house. It was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, two-car garage home.

“Not a fancy home, but we sold it for about $135,000,” said Heimbuck. It was just below market price.

And it was just what Mark and Heather Wilson had been looking for. The houses they had looked at in the area that fit their needs were out of their price range, but then they saw the house G2 built and they bought it.

G2 built two more houses and even fixed up a property downtown that now hosts three different businesses.

But the last house they built stayed on the market for a while and then they had trouble finding another lot to buy. Chuck Frederick said it appeared that the market was changing and fewer people were looking to buy houses. They needed something else.

“Rental homes are certainly needed in the town,” said Frederick. “There’s very few places to rent.”

At that point, they decided G2 had run its course. They paid back their loan and pretty much broke even. Now they hope some younger people in the community will pick up the baton. Dan Sissin at First State Bank said he’s not sure that will happen anytime soon.

“To be honest with you,” said Sissin, “I think it took a special group of people to come together that were willing to take some risk”

He said he’s not holding his breath.

Archestratus in Greenpoint is dedicated to food, from its cookbook inventory to selection of plush fruit toys. Photo Credit: Google Maps

Paige Lipari always wanted a store. She grew up hearing stories about her grandparents’ fresh dairy and Italian imported goods grocery in Bushwick, and though the Sicilian immigrants happily retired before she was born, the lore of their fresh mozzarella sold in a small space in Brooklyn continued.

For Lipari, a bookstore just made sense. She’d worked in the rare books department at Barnes & Noble, as well as a bookseller at Housing Works, McNally Jackson and Idlewild Books.

And thus Archestratus Books & Foods, Lipari’s Greenpoint bookstore dedicated to cookbooks and titles about food with an attached cafe, debuted in 2015. The unusual name (pronounced Ark-eh-stratus) references an ancient Sicilian poet who is considered the author of one of the world’s first cookbooks.

“I come from a poetry background, so I’m always going to be obscure,” Lipari says. “I really believe that cookbooks are like personal documents; the most appealing thing to me is the voice behind the cookbook, and even though Archestratus is from 350 BCE, he is really funny.”

Most importantly, the store’s namesake writes about “keeping things simple and letting the ingredients shine,” paraphrases Lipari. Indeed, the store has “more of an artistic angle” than a technical one, meaning that the community forming at Archestratus is “less concerned with knife skills and more concerned with having the script of ‘My Dinner with Andre.’”

To prepare for Archestratus’ opening, Lipari, her father and her nonna spent a year “picking” books at church sales and library sales throughout the tristate area to find the unique and out-of-print titles on Archestratus’ shelves.

“When I started this I didn’t know [what people would buy],” Lipari says. “I knew that having less expensive, eccentric books would be exciting, but the new books really do sell.”

Archestratus’ customers, who range from neighbors to tourists who’ve read about the store in a Japanese guidebook, frequently buy popular new cookbooks like “Love and Lemons,” based off the blog of the same name, Joshua McFadden’s “Six Seasons” and Alison Roman’s “Dining In.”

The cookbooks may lure customers into the space, but Archestratus is just as focused on building a community.

Part of that is regularly serving inexpensive Sicilian dinners prepared by Lipari, for no more than $20. “It can be cheap to have a meal when everyone’s eating the same thing,” Lipari says.

Diners might feast on timballo (a cake-shaped pasta bake) or vegan pesto while sharing a communal table in the back of the store. Beer, wine and vermouth are also for sale.

When pop-up dinners aren’t held, the tables in the back cafe are filled with locals for lunch or people attending trivia night, craft night, cookbook club or social activism events.

“I loved the idea of designing and creating a space and a community space for people to come together,” Lipari says. “Coffee shops used to have that energy, but now everyone just sits very quietly at their laptops. I wanted a space for people to sit down at a table and have a meeting of some kind.”

Six False Creek affordable housing lots still empty after three decades In 1989, after Concord Pacific bought the old Expo lands, the developer agreed to sell six lots at low-cost to city hall for affordable housing. Those properties, which were to provide 600 affordable homes for families and seniors in popular False Creek, are still empty today.

Article content Thirty years ago, the city of Vancouver unveiled an innovative plan to transform the former Expo 86 lands along False Creek into an urban village with thousands of new homes — and 20 per cent were to be affordable units for families and seniors. John Shayler and other housing advocates begged city hall at the time to find money for those low-cost homes before the developer who bought the massive site began constructing market-priced condominiums.

Today, among the gleaming towers and modern townhouses that line the north shore of trendy False Creek, six lots still remain empty — land that is supposed to hold a total of 600 units for lower-income residents. Those lots were part of a deal the city signed with developer Concord Pacific after it bought the Expo Lands: To reach the 20 per cent affordable housing goal, Concord agreed to sell to Vancouver about a dozen parcels of land at far-below-market value once the city had money from senior governments to build low-cost units on the sites.

Article content For at least six of those lots, that financing from provincial and federal governments never materialized and, as a result, fewer than 10 per cent of homes in False Creek North are deemed affordable right now. “We never did get the housing we were promised,” Shayler says today, standing in front of one of the lots that he predicted three decades ago would remain empty. “We were really keen (in 1989) on getting something written, almost in blood, because we knew that with the price of land, unless the municipal government, the provincial government and the federal government were all in to support the cost of the non-market housing, … the market would not supply what we were looking for. And you can look at it today: The market is failing as far as low-income housing.” Indeed, Metro Vancouver’s sky-high real estate prices have created an affordability crisis for many households today. There is renewed optimism, though, that these lots won’t sit empty forever, given recent promises by the NDP in Victoria and the Liberals in Ottawa to invest in affordable homes — such as co-ops — for below-average-income families. “There’s kind of a shift in the landscape and a new opportunity for partnership that has emerged very recently,” Abigail Bond, Vancouver’s director of affordable housing, said in a recent interview. “So we will definitely be pursuing all possibilities to bring these sites forward.” Rather than being frustrated that these lots remain empty, Bond is grateful a deal was struck long ago to make them available to the city — a deal that, with the right government funding, could help the city “get closer to meeting the needs of Vancouver citizens in relation to affordable housing.”

Article content Photo by Arlen Redekop / PNG The city’s new blueprint to develop the neighbouring community of Northeast False Creek, including the land under the Georgia Street viaducts, states a desire — but no solid details — to “expedite” the construction of affordable housing on those six lots. But can Vancouverites singed by the red-hot real estate market count on these affordable-housing promises in either of the False Creek communities, when for three decades nothing has happened on these six pieces of prime real estate that collectively cover more than three standard football fields. Photo by Arlen Redekop / PNG Maybe, experts say, but it all comes down to money. Land values are soaring. Construction costs are high. And the ground, contaminated by industries originally on the land, still needs to be cleaned up. “There is a lot of money at stake here,” said Cameron Gray, the city’s former housing director. There was certainly much more confidence back on April 27, 1988, when the province announced it had sold to Concord the 82.5 hectares of Expo Lands, which were to eventually hold 7,600 new homes, including 20 per cent at low-cost. Photo by Arlen Redekop / PNG The plan went well at first, since the federal and provincial governments of the day had been making hefty annual investments in affordable housing. But in 1993, the federal Liberals abruptly halted the expensive program, leaving the B.C. NDP to build what it could afford with only provincial dollars until the party lost power in 2001. By then, five affordable developments were completed, including the Roundhouse Co-op and Quayside Family Housing, said Gray, who was not directly involved in the False Creek North deal.

Article content “Since the (B.C.) Liberals came in, in 2001, there have been no programs to speak of,” said Gray. “These sites have been sitting here — the last one that was developed was in 1998.” Today, there are only 542 affordable units in False Creek North, according to the city, far fewer than the 20 per cent target of approximately 1,500. In fact, rental and non-market housing units together make up only nine per cent of the housing stock in False Creek North, much lower than the overall city average of 32 per cent. More than six sites were initially left empty, Gray said, and some trade-offs were made because the cost of the land was rising and there was no money to get the buildings constructed. For example, Concord gave the city 58 West Hastings for social housing — which has turned into a controversial Downtown Eastside project — in exchange for building market-value residential towers at the north end of Cambie Bridge. The provincial Liberals, over their 16 years in power, did invest heavily in social housing for the homeless, including money for new buildings on 13 sites the city of Vancouver provided, said Gray, who oversaw much of that deal. But when it came to affordability for lower-income families and seniors, the Liberals mostly relied on rent subsidies rather than building new co-ops. Photo by Concord Pacific Developments / PNG “The question now is: We have an NDP government, so will there be (an affordable housing) funding program, and will that trigger the redevelopment of the sites?” Gray said.

Article content Several of the experts who spoke to The Sun for this story predicted Concord might be unwilling to sell these sites to the city now, given how valuable they would be in today’s over-inflated real estate market. Appraiser Burgess, Cawley and Sullivan tried to help The Sun determine the value of these lots — which range from 16,400 square feet to 41,700 square feet — but it is difficult to find the answer because they are zoned only for affordable housing, and therefore appraised at far below market value. The Sun asked Concord if the city still has the option to buy these lots from the developer, if the same low-cost price formula hammered out 30 years ago would still apply, and how much the city would have to pay. A brief response from Matt Meehan, Concord’s senior vice-president of planning, said: “These sites are great opportunities to provide non-market and affordable housing. … We look forward to working with the city and the province to build and deliver to the city these much needed housing units.” The city’s Bond remains confident an agreement to buy the lots could be reached and, although she didn’t reveal a specific price tag, argued it would still be cost efficient. “It still presents a really good deal for the city,” she said. “If we are able to find a way to bring those lands forward it still gets us a really unique opportunity for affordable housing in this location that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford to do.” The provincial NDP’s throne speech last month promised “the largest investment in affordable housing in B.C.’s history,” and its budget included $6.2 billion over 10 years to create 33,700 affordable housing units.

Article content But when asked whether these six sites could be part of this affordable housing agenda, the government’s B.C. Housing agency refused to answer, referring questions to Vancouver city hall and the Finance Ministry that oversees the property-buying agreement between Concord and the city. In a brief statement, the Finance Ministry made no commitment to building housing on the sites but noted, if a development deal is ever reached, the province has an agreement to clean up the soil on these sites, as False Creek had previously been a heavy industrial area. Last year, the federal Liberals announced a 10-year, $40-billion housing program that included 100,000 new affordable housing units, but there have been no details so far about how much of that money will be spent in B.C. and where. Following the release of last month’s federal budget, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James was among the critics who complained it did not include a specific long-term strategy to address the affordable housing crisis in cities like Vancouver. Veteran architect and planner Michael Geller said it is “outrageous” that these sites haven’t been developed, but he believes talks could now be rekindled — even if the levels of government come up with a different plan for who might live in these future buildings, such as a mix of social, low-income, rental and affordable ownership. Some type of solution is required, he argued, if people are going to believe the affordable housing promises made for future developments in the city.

Article content “When Northeast False Creek came up, I did say: Look, it’s great to promise all this affordable housing, but let’s not forget we still have these six sites undeveloped in the north shore of False Creek,’” said Geller, who was involved in the Coal Harbour development at the time. One option for these six lots is for the city to sell off the rights for huge profits and to use the money to build affordable housing in less affluent areas; Nathan Edelson, though, believes that would not only create ghettos but would go against the 30-year hope for a mixed-income community for False Creek. “The planning department held on to the principle that a mixed-income community would enjoy living on the waterfront,” said Edelson, a Vancouver city planner from 1983 to 2008 and formerly a University of B.C. adjunct professor of regional planning. Even if these lots have to remain empty a few more years, that is a trade-off Edelson would accept in exchange for an eventual development deal that would, for example, offer housing to workers such as nurses, firefighters and teachers so they could afford to live near where they work. He believes the city did an impressive job in the 1980s negotiating with Concord’s billionaire owner Li Ka-shing to ensure there would be walkways along the water and other community amenities, in addition to land for low-cost homes. It was just not realistic to argue that the city should also have secured upfront money for affordable housing at the start of the deal, added Edelson, who more recently was a member of the Mayor’s Task Force on Housing Affordability.

Article content Shayler, who was with the Downtown Eastside Residents Association before joining the Tenants Rights Coalition, said advocates in the 1980s feared these False Creek units would be desperately needed because affordable housing — such as SROs and low-cost rentals — were increasingly being lost as high-end developments expanded in other parts of the city. “We were calling it then a housing crisis, and that is a long time ago now,” Shayler said. “When we look at the north side of False Creek, yes there are some good things that happened there, but I think (people who need affordable housing) got the short end of the stick. And I’m afraid we will again.” lculbert@postmedia.com

The Lismore City Council wants to hear from possible partners to deliver $3.5 million in affordable housing to combat the accomodation crisis in the region.

The funding is from the Federal Government’s Building Better Regional Cities program, which provided $5 million to Council in 2016 to achieve more affordable housing options across the city.

The council offered 200 grants of $20,000 for residents to purchase and build homes on new land releases, however, less than a quarter of the available fund was used.

Strategic Planning Coordinator Paula Newman said the council had now decided to use the remaining funds to enter into one or more partnerships to build affordable housing with community housing providers, private developers or any other organisations or individual with an interest and experience in housing.

She said the council was looking for innovative ideas and housing models, from a tiny homes estate to small unit developments that champion best-practice sustainability and renewable energy.

‘We’re looking for people to come to us with options – if there is a housing provider with a suitable piece of land we could help build affordable homes, or there may be a developer who is keen to complete a development and reduce the cost of the blocks to affordable standards. We’re happy to look at any realistic proposal,’ Ms Newman said.

‘We are eager to make this happen quite quickly, as we are keenly aware of the housing issues Lismore faces. We do not have enough 1-2 bedroom dwellings to cater for our older population and smaller family structures and we do not have enough housing that is suitable for low-income earners.

‘Our Growth Management Strategy clearly states that building smaller, more affordable dwellings close to services is what Lismore needs. We are excited to see any proposal that genuinely helps address these issues.’

Expressions of interest close at 2pm on Thursday, 29 March 2018.

Interested parties are required to register at the council’s eProcurement portal www.tenderlink.com/lismore to access relevant documents.

Submissions may also be lodged at this site in the electronic tender box. All tender schedules must be completed for submission of a conforming tender.

Design

If you’ve never seen a Razer Blade Pro before, at a glance it definitely doesn’t strike you as a gaming laptop, most of which are thick, large, heavy, and not very portable. The Razer Blade Pro isn’t your typical gaming laptop. The first thing I definitely noticed was the thinness of it, coming in at a mere 0.88″ thick. While there are plenty of thinner laptops out there, for a gaming laptop with these specs, this is definitely one of the thinnest configurations you can get.

The Razer Blade Pro has a nice, simple, sleek black design, housed in a CNC aluminum unibody chassis. Centered on the lid is, of course, the Razer Snake logo which lights up in green when the laptop is powered on. Save

Starting with the left side of the laptop, going from front to back, you’ll find a side speaker, 3.5mm audio/mic jack, two USB 3.0 ports, LAN port, and power port. On the right side, you’ll also find a side speaker near the front, as well as an SD card reader, USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, a third USB 3.0 port, HDMI 2.0 out, and a Kensington lock. Save

Centered at the front of the laptop is a beveled edge which allows you to easily lift the lid. Upon opening the lid, you’re greeted by the full-size keyboard, minus number pad, and the screen. The keyboard has an interesting layout as in place of a number pad is a 4″ x 3 ¼” trackpad. Due to the placement of the trackpad, the up arrow key is sandwiched in between the / and shift keys, while the left, right, and down arrow are on the bottom row between the CTRL and Fn keys. Centered above the trackpad is a volume rocker with two media playback control keys on either side. The media control keys can be set to act as mouse buttons as well if you wish. The keyboard is backlit, as is the outside edge of the trackpad and the edges of the volume rocker. Save

As far as the keyboard is concerned, this is probably my only issue with the laptop. While the keyboard works great for keyboard/mouse gaming and typing is responsive with the low travel keys, the placement and size of the trackpad make it feel like the keyboard is off-centered while typing. Additionally, by moving the up arrow key between the / and right shift key, I frequently found myself moving up a line while typing or selecting an entire row of text instead of typing a / or ? as I intended. Even after a few weeks of use, I still run into that happening more than I’d like. The backlighting is nice as well, however, when playing in a darker environment, you can’t see the additional markings like punctuation and the Fn key functions due to the way the keys are lit. It’s not a huge deal but made it a bit of a pain when trying to find the screen brightness keys (F8/F9) while in a game trying to turn down the brightness. Save

On either side of the keyboard is a thin ½” x 4″ speaker grille. The power button is centered in the top third of the area above the keyboard rounding out the pretty minimalistic looking palm rest/keyboard portion of the laptop.

As far as the screen is concerned, the Full HD IPS matte screen display panel is framed by ¾” bezels on the side and 1″ bezels on the top and bottom. Centered in the bezel above the screen is the 2.0MP webcam with dual microphone holes, one on either side. The lid is attached to the base of the laptop with a 10″ centered hinge which offers nice stability and rigidity when the screen is open.

The bottom of the laptop is pretty minimal as well, with two rubber feet that run the width of the laptop from left to right at the front and back. Just below the back foot are a pair of three vents for cooling on either side of the laptop.

The power adapter is equally slim, especially for its 165W size. While the main wall cable is your typical rubber finish, the cable from the power adapter to the laptop is nicely braided cable. Overall, the Razer Blade Pro is a very sleek and thin gaming laptop given the specs.

Display

As mentioned above, Razer has placed a Full HD IPS matte screen display panel in the Razer Blade Pro FHD version. The matte finish is great for pretty much any lighting condition and greatly reduces glare that you may encounter. Viewing angles are pretty decent as well. In addition, the screen supports 120Hz refresh rate from the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 video card which offers smoother gameplay. Save

While there is a 4K Razer Blade Pro available, affordability is the name of the game here and as far as 1080p displays go, this one is nice and crisp, has a high refresh rate for gaming, and is relatively glare free.

Software

As far as software is concerned, it’s pretty standard fare here with 64-bit Windows 10 Home running things under the hood. As is the case with Windows installations these days, there are a few pre-installed games like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Disney Magic Kingdoms, Bubble Witch Saga 3, and a few others. While some people might enjoy these, they are easy enough to uninstall if you don’t want them on your system. Still, it’d be nice to go back to the days when a clean Windows install meant just that. That being said, fortunately, two of the biggest — in my opinion — pain in the butt pre-installed software items that are usually found on systems — McAfee or Norton — are thankfully missing from the Razer Blade Pro.

The Razer Synapse 2 software is also installed and lets you remap keys, set up profiles, change the primary behaviour of the Fn keys, adjust trackpad settings, set profiles, enable/disable gaming mode, set power options, view keystroke/heatmap stats, and control the lighting. You can also create macros and load Chroma Apps for custom in-game lighting. There are plenty of games and apps that are supported and some will pre-install while others require you to download the profile and add it in manually which is easy enough to do. What these profiles do is modify keyboard lighting based on the game or app you’re using. For example, in Diablo III, the 1/2/3/4 and Q keys are lit in white while the rest are red. While this looks kind of cool, unless you’re in the habit of looking at your keyboard while playing, it isn’t very useful in my opinion. Save

While the Razer Synapse 2 software is great for adjusting lighting and keyboard or trackpad behaviour and profiles, unfortunately, you may have to also install the Razer Synapse 3 beta software if you’re using a newer Razer peripheral like the Razer Naga Trinity gaming mouse. The Synapse 2 software doesn’t recognize the mouse, and likewise, the Synapse 3 software doesn’t recognize the Razer Blade Pro. The biggest issue with this, aside from having two versions of Synapse installed, is that you can’t sync your lighting between the Blade Pro and your Synapse 3 supported Razer peripheral. Razer did mention when asked that “Synapse 3 will eventually replace the existing Synapse 2 once features are complete and all devices are supported,” so at some point you’ll be able to adjust your Razer Blade Pro from within the Synapse 3 software as well.

In addition, for all you music creators out there, Razer has partnered with Image-Line to give every Razer Blade Pro owner (2016 and newer models) a free copy of FL Studio 12 (a $199USD value). If you’re into playing around with music creation, this is a pretty sweet deal.

Performance

Given the specs on this laptop — Quad-Core 7th Gen Intel Core i7-7700HQ, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5, 16GB dual-channel memory, 256GB SSD PCIe M.2, and Killer Networking — you’d expect pretty decent performance, and you wouldn’t be wrong. For day-to-day tasks like word processing, photo editing, streaming video, and browsing the internet, the Razer Blade Pro performs admirably with no hesitation, lag, or slow down.

But hey, the Razer Blade Pros are gaming laptops so how does it fare for gaming? While the GTX 1060 isn’t the top of the line NVIDIA card, at the price point and other components of the FHD version of the Blade Pro, it does just fine. For games like Heroes of the Storm, the system ran at about 80fps with everything set to Ultra. For more CPU/GPU intensive games like Forza Motorsport 7, with the settings set to Ultra (1920×1080) we saw a consistent 60fps. As mentioned in the Display section, the 120Hz refresh rate really adds to smoother gameplay as well.When hooked up to a 4K monitor, the Razer Blade Pro keeps up pretty well, although you may have to drop down from Ultra or Extreme settings in some games to get a decent framerate.

The addition of a 2TB hard drive, albeit a 5400RPM drive, makes it easy to keep the precious space on the SSD for games and apps with all your data like photos, videos, and other files on the 2TB drive. Should you choose the 4K route, the Razer Blade Pro is also available with a 512GB or 1TB SSD as well should you wish to pay a bit.

I’ll cover this more in the Price/Value section below, but really, for the price, you’re getting great specifications and performance with the FHD Razer Blade Pro for both gaming and day-to-day computing use.

Sound Quality

Laptops are notoriously not that great for sound. In the case of the Razer Blade Pro, the sound is crisp and clear and gets quite loud but, unfortunately, still lacks the required bass and lower end for more enjoyable and immersive gaming. Most gamers have solid gaming headphones anyways, but in a pinch, the onboard sound on the Razer Blade Pro will do just fine.

The Razer Blade Pro is also equipped with Dolby Digital Plus software which can be used to select pre-tuned sound for music, gaming, movies, or create your own presets to tweak the sound more to your personal preferences. Save

Camera/Microphone

As with most laptops, there’s not much to say here. The front-facing 2MP webcam is decent for video conferencing or broadcasting while streaming games and provided a clear enough image. In addition, the dual-array microphones were good enough for the other party to be able to hear clearly without having to ask me to repeat what I had just said.

Battery Life

Again, laptops — especially gaming laptops — are notoriously bad for battery life. The Razer Blade Pro isn’t too bad as far as gaming laptops go and during testing, we saw between 4 ½ – 5 hours while doing basic tasks like word processing, browsing, or Photoshop. Of course, while gaming this dropped down to between 2 ½ and 3 hours depending on the game and settings. It’s not the greatest, but it is better than some other gaming laptops and given the specs, to be expected.

Price/Value

With an MSRP of $2299.99USD ($2899.99CAD), the Razer Blade Pro FHD version is a bit on the pricier side considering the components used. However, if you’re looking for a thinner gaming laptop that can handle most of what you can throw at it, you might be willing to shell out the extra cash. Razer is currently offering $300USD off this price so you can snag it for an extremely reasonable $1999.99USD. The company is also offering a lesser discount of $350 for Canadians, bringing the price down to $2549.99CAD.

Wrap-up

Decent gaming laptops are usually notoriously huge and expensive. The Razer Blade Pro FHD is a more affordable option with great performance with a sleeker design than is normally seen in gaming laptops. Even though there are still a few minor issues like sound and battery life, these are pretty standard when it comes to gaming laptops, especially with specs like the Razer Blade Pro has under the hood. Overall, given the price — and the current sale price at that — coupled with the specs, if you’re looking for a decent gaming laptop at a decent price, the Razer Blade Pro FHD nicely fits the bill.

Design

The Creative Pebble desktop speakers are aptly named given Creative derived the inspiration for them from the zen Japanese rock gardens. Circular in shape, each black (in the case of our review unit) plastic satellite has a flat back and the front is angled at 45º which gives it a sleek, modern look. These definitely wouldn’t look that out of place sitting in a zen rock garden either…

The front of each speaker has a round tweeter in the upper two-thirds of the face which has a gold sticker in the middle. The gold ties in with the Creative logo on the bottom portion of the left speaker. On the right speaker is where you’ll find the power/volume knob beside a small green power LED indicator light. Underneath the knob is a small circle towards the left to indicate lower volume and a solid filled circle with the letters VOL beside it on the right for full volume. While the outer shell is a matte black, the inside of the front of each speaker is a glossy, more rubbery finish which easily attracts fingerprints. It does look nice though, it’s just something to be aware of when handling or moving the speakers around. Save

Turning the speakers around, the aforementioned flat component is where you’ll find an oval-shaped passive radiator on each one. Below this is a small (and easily missed) L or R to indicate left or right speaker. Near the bottom is a small cutout from which a single wire runs from the left speaker to the right and the USB and 3.5mm audio wires run out of the right speaker. The wires are plenty long with the left to right speaker wire running about 42″ in length and the USB and 3.5mm audio wires running about 48″ in length. Depending on your setup, this should be ample to comfortable place the speakers where you want them in relation to your computer and/or monitor. Save

The bottom of the speakers have an oval-shaped rubber ring as well which rests nicely on your desktop, preventing both scratches and errant sliding around.

The Creative Pebble desktop speakers definitely have a low profile, modern look to them and they do look rather nice on your desk.

Ease of Use

Desktop speakers, even the 2.0 variety, can be super simple or a bit more complicated to install depending on how many cables you have to connect and if they are externally powered or not. Thankfully, the Creative Pebble are of the former category and simply require that you plug the USB cable into an available USB port on your computer and the 3.5mm audio jack into your headphone out or green audio port on your computer. Once connected, turn the volume knob clockwise past the click to turn them on and adjust your volume accordingly.

Being USB-powered, if you have limited ports on your laptop then you might need to get a bit creative. Fortunately, being USB-powered you can always plug them into a USB power adapter and power them off of that. The nice thing about that route is that you’re not taking up one of the few ports you may have on your computer (if that is an issue) but you can also use these with other devices that have a 3.5mm audio jack like portable music players or even your smartphone.

Sound Quality

If you’re like me, you generally stay away from cheaper desktop speakers because more often than not, the price you pay reflects the sound quality you get. Fortunately, in this case, the Creative Pebble desktop speakers sound rather fantastic for a pair of 2.0 speakers. It helps that the 45º front design fires the audio up towards you instead of straight towards you. As well, the passive radiators add just the right amount of bass. Save

As far as music is concerned, everything I put through these speakers from hip-hop to rock, EDM to dance, and classical to chill sounded great and relatively balanced. If anything, these may favour the low end a bit more than the highs but personally, I like that. Depending on what music you listen to, you can definitely feel the beat through your desk as well. That might be annoying to some but I rather like that side-effect as it pulls me into whatever music I’m listening to.

Of course, I had to try them out for gaming as well and I must say that they were pretty impressive on that front as well. Keeping in mind that these aren’t 5.1 surround speakers, you’re not going to be getting the full surround effect that can be helpful in some games. That being said, the Creative Pebble speakers were more than satisfactory for playing games like Heroes of the Storm and even Forza Motorsport 7 on the desktop.

Simply put, the Creative Pebble desktop speakers had surprisingly decent sound for their size and will easily give you acceptable sound for your desktop computer or improve the sound coming from your laptop.

Price/Value

Priced at $24.99USD, the Creative Pebble desktop speakers are very affordably priced, especially considering the sound quality they put out. These little speakers are definitely in impulse-buy territory. Save

Wrap-up

The Creative Pebble Modern 2.0 USB Desktop Speakers offer great sound at an extremely reasonable price. If you’re looking for a small pair of desktop speakers that aren’t going to break the bank and give you decent sound, you should definitely give the Creative Pebble a go.

41,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/charlotte-debate-highlights-tensions-in-affordable-housing,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Next City,Charlotte Debate Highlights Tensions in Affordable Housing,"In what was a contentious session, Charlotte City Council yesterday approved financing for 11 affordable housing projects, The Charlotte Observer reports. The debate, largely between the mayor and newer city council members, highlighted multiple tensions in affordable housing development.

On one dimension, there’s affordability. As the Observer reports, some newly elected members said the city isn’t doing enough for its poorest residents. That “drew a sharp rebuke” from Mayor Vi Lyles, who campaigned on affordable housing — Lyles believes the city should also build housing for people earning 60 percent of the area median income, which would be a salary of about $43,000 for a family of four. “I am beginning to wonder if we believe in upward mobility,” the Observer quoted Lyles saying.

That tension reflects debates going on in other parts of the country, where cities like NYC are getting headlines for top-line numbers of affordable housing units produced, but heavy criticism that the units produced aren’t affordable for those who need them most. One study clearly shows that the “affordable” units produced through city-subsidized financing under Mayor Bill De Blasio’s housing plan do not match up with the income levels of those who are “rent burdened” — spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent. While housing industry veterans rightly point out that affordable housing is in need across a variety of income levels, tenant advocates maintain that public dollars should be spent on those most in need.

On another dimension, there’s the location of affordable housing units, and the desire to break the historic pattern of concentrating them in existing low-income neighborhoods — a pattern the U.S. Supreme Court has declared at odds with the Fair Housing Act. In Dallas, the Department of Housing and Neighborhood Revitalization used a data-driven process to identify locations where the city should be building new affordable housing versus preserving existing affordable housing. But when it unveiled a housing plan based on that process, the city’s established network of neighborhood-based affordable housing developers felt left behind.

“The idea of the Fair Housing Act is to give people access to more upwardly mobile communities,” Raquel Favela, chief of economic development and neighborhood services for Dallas, told Next City’s Jared Brey. “And that’s exactly what this plan seeks to do.”

Back in Charlotte, the Observer reports that five of the eleven approved projects needed waivers from the city’s housing locational policy, which was designed to ensure subsidized housing was not clustered in poor areas. According to the Observer, council members in recent years have been usually willing to approve those waivers. None of the approved projects are in south Charlotte’s affluent “wedge,” where there is little subsidized housing — Council Member James Mitchell, a Democrat, said the city needs to revisit the waiver policy, the Observer reports.","In what was a contentious session, Charlotte City Council yesterday approved financing for 11 affordable housing projects, The Charlotte Observer reports.

The slow death of fully public development — which has been replaced steadily with public-private partnerships — is partially to blame, the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) told L.A. officials last week, according to the station. Today, private developers often use public funds for construction, and in exchange agree to rent units at a reduced rate for a set time period. When that period expires, the developer is free to raise the rent; owners of Section-8 funded apartments operate under a similar agreement. As properties age and incur maintenance costs, the risk increases that landlords will, in fact, raise the rent.

In Los Angeles County, 11,000 units fall into the public-private partnership category, CHPC said in its presentation last week.

As Next City has covered, L.A. officials are scrambling to deal with an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis. L.A. Metro has studied placing supportive services on its properties, for example allowing people who live in their cars to park at Metro-owned stations and shower at bus storage yards. In 2016, voters approved Proposition HHH, a $1.2-billion bond expected to fund the construction of 10,000 new units for homeless and low-income people over the next ten years (24 projects have been approved so far). Last year, L.A. City Council approved a plan to impose so-called linkage fees on higher-end development to fund the construction of below-market-rate units.

And to a certain extent, homeowners are joining in. A series of state legislative tweaks in 2016 and 2017 reduced regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs), and in 2017 L.A. residents filed nearly 2,000 applications to convert their basements, garages and backyard cottages into low-cost housing (only 90 applications were filed in 2015 before the regulations were reduced).

But all of those city-led measures don’t erase the fact that federal and state resources are drying up. In anticipation of federal tax reform, low-income housing tax credits have plummeted in value, KPCC reports. In 2017, L.A. County saw a 21 percent decline in tax credit funding for new affordable homes.

And the state’s 2012 shutdown of city Redevelopment Agencies hasn’t helped matters. Those agencies were supposed to set aside 20 percent of their property tax revenues for affordable housing projects. In L.A., that translated to about $50 million annually, the city’s housing department recently told the Los Angeles Times.

Compounding that loss, the city opted to spend state funds that would have gone to the agencies (before they were shut down) on city services such as law enforcement, firefighters and pensions, rather than on affordable housing, the paper reports.

From the L.A. Times story:

Some jurisdictions, including Oakland and Emeryville, dedicated a similar percentage of boomerang funds to housing or helping the poor after redevelopment ended. However, many California cities and counties were reluctant to do the same, facing pressure to spend money to restore services and increase salaries for government employees in the aftermath of the recession.

L.A. County needs to identify affordable housing that’s at risk of evaporating and provide incentives for landlords to keep the units low-cost, CHPC President Matt Schwartz said last week, according to KPCC.

“Over a ten-year period, if there are not further changes … we could be short about 70,000 affordable homes [state-wide],” he said.","Despite Los Angeles’ new bond for homeless housing and recently-approved linkage fees, the surrounding county is at risk of losing $3 billion worth of affordable housing over the next half-decade, radio station KPCC reports.

The Cape Development, located at Cape Paterson in Southeast Victoria, is an eco-village of 220 lots, each of which will be occupied by an extremely energy-efficient home just a short walk from the beach. The latest model on offer is a CORE 9 prototype from the Wonthaggi-based architectural firm Beaumont Concepts.

A ""raked roof"" promotes daylighting, while a 6Kw photovoltaic solar array with 4.8Kw battery storage generates clean energy. The front porch encourages socializing with the neighbors.

CORE is an acronym that stands for carbon positive, zero waste, recyclability, and economics. As such, the home relies on passive solar design and renewable energy sources, and uses materials that can be recycled or have recycled content. Construction waste was minimized during the build process. Highlights of the compact three-bedroom design include its nine-star energy rating, superior thermal performance, water-harvesting system, and streamlined style, all constructed for just $323,000 (or $420,000 in Australian dollars).

The home's rectilinear floor plan facilitates coastal cross-breezes (or passive cooling), while thermally broken double-glazed windows ensure the building envelope stays tight to reduce carbon emissions.

In order to encourage affordability, the CORE design can be adapted for different energy star ratings (set by the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme in Australia) and budgets, starting at a 6-star energy rating for around $192,000 (or $250,000 AUS dollars) and topping out at a 10-star rating (price to be determined).

The home boasts high indoor air quality thanks to zero emission joinery, low-VOC paint, stains, and carpets, and construction that utilizes cross-ventilation.

In keeping with their design and construction approach, Beaumont Concepts filled the home with select handmade and locally-sourced products that are composed with upcycled or recycled content.

The kitchen stools are from Tuscan Outdoor Tables, a Dandenong, Victoria, outfit that crafts furniture from local Cypress and reclaimed timber.

A pass-through window in the kitchen connects to the porch for ease of socializing.

Federal Reserve findings indicate a growing percentage of renters are either cost-burdened or extremely cost-burdened by rising rents and stagnating incomes. The Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) of Harvard University published a 2017 study that found more than one-third of U.S. households were rental units. The research further suggests that overall household growth will be strong over the next decade as larger numbers of the extremely large millennial generation move out on their own — therefore pushing the number of households in our country, higher.

To put this into context, a joint study by Hoyt Advisory Services, the National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association estimates we'll need an additional 4.6 million new apartment households by 2030 or 325,000 apartments annually just to keep up with demand. The affordable supply is already low and government incentives are minimal. Thus, the gap of affordable housing we need to fill widens.

If left alone, experts say the issue will cause other social problems such as homelessness, job loss, poverty, hunger, social isolation, inequality, drug abuse, the list goes on. Princeton University sociology professor, McArthur Genius grant recipient and author Matthew Desmond said it well in an interview with Habitat for Humanity: “I think that whatever we care about — whatever is our issue that keeps us up at night — a lack of affordable housing is going to be somewhere at the center of it.”

However, these conditions do present significant opportunities for investment and the opportunity to make impact investments (defined as doing well financially by doing good socially and environmentally) for a triple bottom-line return.

As a 30-year veteran impact investor and leader in value-add multifamily housing, I propose that we collectively and individually tackle this crisis head-on through a combination of investment and awareness. How?

1. Invest in new supply (i.e., development). We need to build and invest in as much new housing as possible, including affordable and even shiny new luxury product in order to help offset the nationwide gap. As incomes rise and people are able to afford higher rents, they step up out of the older, more affordable housing stock, leaving room for the middle-income folks to step in. Individual investors can hunt for plenty of new housing development opportunities on online marketplaces like CrowdStreet or RealCrowd. (Full disclosure: We partner with CrowdStreet.) We simply need more supply any way we can get it.

2. Invest in older assets (i.e., value-add). We must also invest in the improvement of older, neglected multifamily assets and deem a portion of them affordable for people at the low and moderate end of the economic spectrum. It has been my observation and experience that this strategy, if done correctly, tends to pay out stronger, more reliable cash flow than new supply. Our new impact multifamily real estate fund is doing just this across America, as are others, including legendary baseball player Alex Rodriguez's firm.

3. Invest in home ownership. Simultaneously, we need to invest in keeping individuals and families in their existing owned homes, thus preventing foreclosures. Individual investors can invest directly in this effort through expert sponsors such as American Home Preservation Fund, which essentially purchases pools of nonperforming mortgages sold at significant discounts from mortgage holders. These funds use investor money to purchase these pools, then work with homeowners to find sustainable solutions that keep them in their homes, and investors receive returns from the profits.

4. Take advantage of tax reform. We need to also look at and take advantage of the new tax incentives tied to investing in certain asset classes and categories such as the Opportunity Zones program. Developed and defined by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), this is a new, national community investment program that connects private capital with low-income communities across America and offers three types of tax incentives to investors for investing in Treasury Department-approved opportunity funds. Also, now, investors who receive income paid out by pass-through businesses such as REITs are eligible for a 20% tax exemption on that income.

5. Spread the word. We must educate fellow Americans on the housing crisis in our country and inform those wanting to fix it of how to do so through social media, word of mouth, fundraising, investment, housing events and volunteering. We must also encourage socially responsible investors, purpose-oriented foundations and socially conscious institutions to participate in impact investment opportunities. According to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) 2017 Annual Survey, 209 of the world’s leading impact investing organizations collectively manage nearly $114 billion (USD) in impact assets worldwide. Surely, they can afford to put some more money to work in solving our housing crisis.

And to all my fellow sponsors out there, we must create more opportunities for investments in housing that are open to all investors, regardless of accreditation. Under the JOBS Act, Title IV (Regulation A), the Securities and Exchange Commission has made that possible. There is a lot of capital that can be put towards this effort if we make investments available to anyone.

Everyone needs a place to live. Having a safe, decent, affordable home should be a right for all, not a privilege for select few. We all need housing to be better and more affordable in this country, if it not for ourselves and our neighbors, then for our economy and for generations to come. And there’s no better time than now.","The affordable supply is already low and government incentives are minimal.

Students at Arizona State University and the Newtown Community Development Corporation hope to break ground within a year’s time on a project they call Humble Homes.

“The Humble Homes project, it was devised and created by a group of engineering students at ASU,” said Tempe City Councilwoman Lauren Kuby said. “They came up with this idea for a model infield development — affordable housing development — in Tempe.”

The living community would be located near Apache Boulevard and Rural Road.

The project would build a cluster of 600-square-foot micro homes that would consist of one bedroom, a kitchen and a living space.

Dubbed the Tempe Micro Estates by the developer, it would also feature a community home and kitchen area.

“We’re not just building houses,” Kuby said. “We’re building affordable houses and building community.”

Kuby said prices for the homes had not been set. They could be as high as $130,000 but could be lower depending on sustainability perks, such as solar power.

“Some of the students who were involved at the very beginning, three years ago when we started to conceive this project, hope to be involved as well,” Kuby said.

“Some of the best ideas in urban solutions come from our students at Arizona State University and we’re so excited to work with engineering students on this fabulous idea.”

<p>We are on the cusp of the second wave of battery electric vehicles (EVs). Models coming out now and in the next couple years are larger and more mainstream than the EVs that came earlier. They also will be capable of much longer range: 250 to 300 miles on a charge. But what of those early attempts at electrification from the first wave? Many of them are available on the used market—often for surprisingly low prices.</p><p>Before the arrival of the Nissan Leaf in 2011, the battery electric-vehicle (EV) market was almost non-existent. The Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt proved to be a vanguard of what was to follow. Some automakers sold EVs that were designed solely to comply with the California regulations, which required that car makers offer a percentage of their fleet with zero emissions. Yet others embraced the idea that electrification might be the future. The EVs built in that first wave, between 2011 and 2016, were typically small, expensive, and had a range of 60-100 miles on a charge.</p><p><strong>Risk</strong></p><p>Buying a used car is always a risk—even with good documentation and service records, it is still hard to know how well a vehicle has been maintained and whether it has been abused. The good news about used electric vehicles is that EVs, with fewer moving parts than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, have been shown to be mechanically robust and reliable, requiring little beyond routine maintenance. In addition, because of their limited range, they often have accumulated quite low mileage for their year, another positive.</p><p>But there is a sword hanging over any used EV: the battery pack. The condition of the lithium-ion battery pack that powers EVs of this period depends enormously on how it has been treated during its lifetime. Repeated fast charging, completely depleting the battery, or operation at hot or cold temperature extremes can result in a battery pack with reduced capability when compared to when it was new. Just normal aging of a pack can result in a reduction of around 5% capacity per year. Many car makers placed warranties on their battery packs, typically 8 years or 100,000 miles, but some early EVs on the used market are nearing that age limit. So the range quoted for a new EV in 2015 may not be reached by a used EV in 2018 with an aging pack.</p><p><strong>Good News</strong></p><p>There are two bits of good news for those contemplating a used EV. The cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen dramatically, from well over $1000 per kilowatt-hour (kW) just a few years ago to around $200 per kWh today. Secondly, there has grown up a cottage industry of specialists who can rejuvenate a used EV pack, replacing malfunctioning cells and returning them to nearly new capacity. There are also some aftermarket computer tools available to assess to condition of a pack. Suffice it to say that any buyer of a used EV should do their homework before considering such a purchase.</p><p>To examine the prices of some available used EVs, <em>Design News</em> reached out to <em><a href=""https://www.kbb.com/"">Kelly Blue Book</a></em> (KBB) to provide current used car prices. KBB is an industry standard for reliable used car pricing. We chose to price our cars as if they were in Very Good condition and if we were buying from a private party. The prices when buying from a used car dealer might be slightly higher. We reported the current used price for the first year a vehicle was available, the used price for a 2017 model of the vehicle or the last year it was available, and the new vehicle price (MSRP from KBB) for the last year it was available, or for 2018 if the vehicle is still available.</p><p>We also included a few plug-in hybrids in our list. These vehicles allow some electric-only range using a battery pack that is charged at home and then resort to a gasoline engine to produce a longer range. Car companies looked at plug-in hybrids as a way to address the “range anxiety” that was present when EVs only had a range of 60-100 miles on a charge.</p><p>With prices that range from less than $5,000 to more than $60,000, here are some used EVs to consider.</p><p> </p><p>Photo: 2011 Chevrolet Volt (Image source: Chevrolet)</p>","14 Pre-owned Electric Vehicle Models: An Affordable Way To Electrify<p>We are on the cusp of the second wave of battery electric vehicles (EVs).

An affordable and effective device that can close the hole and help the children lead a normal life has been developed by doctors of the Hyderabad-based CARE Hospitals.

Called KONAR-MF, the titanium-nickel alloy device is bio-compatible, multifunctional and has benn tested on over 150 patients in Indonesia, the Philippines, and elsewhere.

“We have collaborated with LifeTech, a medical devices company based in Shenzhen province of China, which has obtained the CE mark that gives it access to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets,” said K Nageswara Rao, Chief Paediatric Cardiologist at CARE Hospitals and developer of KONAR-MF.

“We have applied for patents in the US, Europe and India. Approvals from the Indian drug regulator are expected within six months,” Nageswara Rao told BusinessLine.

The company has agreed to set an affordable price, and benefit from government subsidy.

Globally, too, the device will be sold at a competitive price by LifeTech, he said. For the Chinese market, LifeTech will get approvals, while for the USFDA nod a study is being designed for meeting the requirements, he said.

Benefits

According to available data, the incidence of a congenital heart disease is 10 out of 1,000.

About 25 per cent of these patients end up with a hole in the heart. Called Ventricular septal defect (VSD) , the hole can lead to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and other complications.

The reasons for the heart condition are consanguineous marriage, pesticide exposure, Rubella and some key vitamin deficiencies, said Nageswara Rao.

The treatment solutions available are open heart surgery and catheterisation. However, reports on the failure of some of the devices have necessitated improvements in the line.

In this scenario, KONAR-MF offers the best hope, especially for those with VSD. The device has been tested on children from one year and above.

Among its several advantages are easy implant procedure, and designing the patch precisely to the size of the hole, says Rao.

The device also holds promise for a variety of other conditions such as fistula and paravalvular leaks.","Here’s a reason for parents of children with a hole in the heart to cheer.

#Crowdfunding to finance #solar systems across Africa Energise Africa allows investors to invest in solar businesses that can deliver a clear social, environmental and financial return.https://t.co/ByCM1zrLhl #impactInvesting #Socfin #impinv pic.twitter.com/mHFJ0y2vsk — Lee-Chin Institute (@Lee_Chin_Inst) April 9, 2018

Launched last year with financial support from UK aid and Virgin Unite, it is aimed at bringing reliable energy and economic opportunities to homes in Sub-Saharan Africa through the installation of solar home systems. This is being done in line with the UN agreed Global Goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable modern energy for all by 2030.

Energise Africa will raise £2.5 million a year through retail-focused investments that will generate 5% tax-free annual return investors over a 36-month period although capitals are at risk and returns are not guaranteed.

What Would Energise Africa Offer?

There has been a poor performance of power in the Sub-Saharan parts of Africa, with unstable and unavailability of electricity affecting the quality of life and limiting people’s chances of achieving economic prosperity they have to depend on diesel and kerosene for lighting.

Energise Africa makes this easy and straight forward for eligible retail investors by presenting them with an opportunity to invest in solar business and get financial returns.

Speaking on the innovation, CEO of BBOXX, Mansoor Hamayun says:

Working with Lendahand Ethex as crowdfunding via their Energise Africa campaign represents an exciting mechanism to help us access critical finance to achieve our objectives. This raise is part of the first credit facility of many, which is likely to result in up to £10 million of retail investment over the next few years, providing an estimated 100,000 households in Africa with access to clean and affordable energy. Our NEW partnership with @BBOXX_HQ aims to raise £2.5 million in total to fund their solar installations in rural African countries.

How is this Mechanism Different?

9.5 million people in rural #Rwanda can’t access mains electricity. Investing in @BBOXX_Rwanda bond offer will help them bring #solar to 2,500 Rwandan homes. Supported by 25% match-funding from @DFID_UK https://t.co/dxt4O7yyRa Capital at risk pic.twitter.com/oAMZbjVnQF — energiseafrica (@energiseafrica) April 9, 2018

According to Lendahand Ethex’s MD Danny den Hartog, one of the main inhibiting factors for solar and energy access in Rwanda, Togo and Nigeria is the lack of available and competitive finance. But with Energise Africa, the current funding gap of $2.5 million will make the difference.

The first Energise Africa project for BBOXX will focus on Rwanda for about 2,500 Rwandan families, and guess what? A BBOXX customer in Rwanda would just have to pay £3-£5 per month, via a mobile pay-as-you-go (PAYG) app, to access uninterrupted solar power from the BBOXX system. This is a cleaner and cheaper option than the current fossil fuel solutions, and definitely a win for African families.

BBOXX’s business model has already proven successful across Africa, with more than 150,000 systems already installed, and serving the needs of 750,000 people.

Article content Patience is paying off for Bob and Wendy Heatley of Calgary. The couple has been waiting several years for multi-family builder Cedarglen Living to launch a new project on the north side of the city. As soon as sales opened in early February for the Rise at the Parks of Harvest Hills, they were first in line. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Well worth the wait: quality, location key attributes of the Rise condos Back to video “We live in a Cedarglen home now in Panorama Hills,” says Bob, a loyal-to-the-brand type of guy. “We like the quality and the bells and whistles they include.” The Heatleys have been empty-nesters for eight years. Their retirement plan is to downsize from their 1,508-square-foot home to a condo, reducing expenses and bothersome maintenance. A few years ago, they found the floor plan they wanted at another Cedarglen multi-family project. The Rise had a variation of that plan, and the Heatleys snapped it up — a spacious 1,158-square-foot, two-bedroom end unit on the top floor. “We saw that plan several years ago at a project in New Brighton, but we just can’t bring ourselves to live in the south. I’m in the courier business and I need to be up by the airport,” says Bob, a self-proclaimed workaholic who may not fully retire.

Article content “I think we stalked our sales rep at Cedarglen wondering when they might have something in the north for us,” says Wendy with a laugh. The Heatleys looked at other projects in the north but loved the central location with established amenities. “We didn’t want to go as far west as Nolan Hill or Sherwood. We have the whole Country Hills area right there, with Sobeys, restaurants, movie theatres and the rec centre. And Deerfoot Trail is very accessible, too. That’s another reason why we waited for this project in Harvest Hills,” Bob explains. Wendy is looking forward to the beautiful open-concept kitchen with granite counter tops, plenty of storage and easy to clean laminate floors. Bob is more excited about the affordability. “We’ll have no mortgage and just the condo fee,” he says. “We know the location, we know the quality that Cedarglen offers. The only thing we’re not quite sure about is living in a condo,” Bob admits. “We have a lot of stuff to get rid of,” Wendy adds. The Heatleys weren’t the first waiting to buy a new home in such a premium north location. In the first six weeks of sales, Cedarglen Living sold 50 units. Sales and development manager Ward Haggins attributes the flurry of sales to attractive price, the central location in an established community and the resourceful manner in which the former Harvest Hills Golf Course has been reimagined. “There’s a huge amount of open park space, plus more than five kilometres of pathways just in the community itself. We’re also building a central plaza and courtyard area for community events,” Haggins explains.

Over the past several years I have seen countless articles in regards to the health hazards of sitting at a desk all day long. A quick search of the web shows that many health professionals advise against sitting all day long. For many of us though that is where our jobs require us to be. So what is to be done? Readydesk has come up with an affordable solution that may be what the doctor ordered. Read on for the full review of the Readydesk 2 desk converter.

What’s In The Box

Readydesk 2

Laptop stand

Design

The Readydesk 2 has a very simple design. There are only six parts in the entire desk. There are two legs, two shelves, and two cross-braces. The desk is made of engineered wood and is capable of holding a total of 75 lbs. Don’t let the fact that the Readydesk is made of engineered wood fool you into thinking that this desk is made with inferior materials. Engineered wood is stronger than solid wood thanks to variations in grain due to the many thin layers of wood used to build a piece up. The glue used to hold the pieces together also adds to the strength of engineered wood. Not only is the Readydesk very strong, the pale birch wood with its tight grain also makes it very beautiful.

The shelves, legs, and cross-braces are all finished very nicely and have a satin sheen to them. Everything is smooth, and I did not encounter any splinters on the wood. There are cable slots on the shelves to keep your cables under control. The legs have slots that allow you to adjust the shelves up or down depending on how you want your peripherals positioned. The only problem with adjusting would be having to remove your equipment every time you need to do so. For an extra $10USD there is also have the option to get a matching laptop stand. And that’s it, nothing more to talk about as far as design. The design is simple and minimalistic. Save

Assembly/Installation

As I just mentioned, the Readydesk 2 has a very simple design. Assembly only required putting the cross-brace together, attaching the cross-brace to both legs, then sliding on the shelves. I think it took me about 3 minutes to put the Readydesk together when I first got it. Readydesk does state that no tools are required, and although this is true, I would recommend having a rubber mallet on hand to pop the cross-brace onto the legs. It can be done with just your hands, but a rubber mallet will make things easier. The simple design makes it easy to put together, easy to take apart, easy to reposition shelves and even easy to move the entire Readydesk should you need to.

Ease of Use

Although repositioning shelves and moving the Readydesk 2 themselves may be easy, I’m afraid it becomes a bit more difficult when you have your equipment sitting on said shelves. The keyboard shelf shouldn’t be a problem; keyboards are small enough. The problem arises when you want to move the monitor shelf. It requires taking the peripherals off the Readydesk, removing the cables from the slots on the shelves and then setting everything back up after moving the shelves. This becomes even more difficult should you have an all in one computer on the monitor shelf. Now, this problem is not insurmountable; it’s just an inconvenience that I noticed while moving shelves around.

Performance

For me, the question of performance boils down to how versatile the Readydesk 2 is when it comes to the number positions that it can accommodate, how easy it is to reconfigure the desk into those positions, and how much weight it can securely hold. It only took me two tries to get the perfect standing position for myself. The keyboard shelf in the fourth position and the monitor shelf in the eighth position worked best for me. I had my daughter try it, and she liked having the keyboard and monitor shelves one position lower than what I had. Readydesk says that the Readydesk 2 can accommodate persons from 5′ to 6′ 3″. I’m 5′ 10″ and my daughter is 5′ 5″, and we both had no problems finding a sweet spot on the Readydesk 2

Ok, the Readydesk 2 was made as a standing desk converter so its no surprise it works well in that capacity. But I also found that it works well if you are sitting. I placed the keyboard shelf in the first position and the monitor in the third position and found this was more comfortable than my standard desk setup. My posture was better because I was looking straight into the screen as opposed to slightly down as in my normal position. So the Readydesk not only allows you to stand up and work, but it also serves to improve the working experience while you are sitting.

As far as the weight that the Readydesk 2 will securely hold, their website claims it will hold up to 75 lbs. While I did not test it out to its max capacity, I did place a 27″ iMac that weighs almost 21 pounds on the top shelf. There was a minuscule amount of sagging right in the middle of the shelf, but not enough to make me doubt that my iMac was safe in that position. In the end I would have to say that the Readydesk 2 is very sturdy and more than capable of holding what I had to throw at it.

Price/Value

The Readydesk 2 we received was the Value combo with the Readydesk 2 and a laptop stand. It is available for $169.99USD from Readydesk. You can also buy just the Readydesk 2 for $159.99USD or a Super combo with the Readydesk 2, laptop stand and a floor mat for $209.99USD. I think this is a fair price considering the Readydesk 2 not only functions as a standing desk but also can be used sitting down.

Wrap Up

If you’re concerned about what sitting all day long can do to your health, check out the Readydesk 2. It’s an attractive desk converter that is highly configurable and easy to use. I think both of those factors will make it an attractive option for anyone looking for a desk converter. Having to remove all your equipment to adjust the shelves may be only a small flaw, but only you can decide if you’re willing to overlook that for the other benefits the Readydesk 2 has to offer.

Here is a list of as many as 15 cars and SUVs that can be customised even before you buy it.

Maruti Ignis

It comes with a long list of official accessories, which include body stripes, roof wrap, seat covers, window visors, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, engine undercover, anti-theft nuts, smart ambient lighting and 15-inch alloy wheels. These work well to give the Freestyle an even more stylish look.

These kits come with a host of features like a roof box, side sill skirts, rear skirts, Heads Up Display with TPMS, wireless charging with support tray, and 3D modular mats among other smaller bits. There’s also an optional roof-mounted canopy for those of you who love to go camping. All these additional accessories make the already well-sorted SUV-crossover more likeable.

Ford EcoSport

The recently facelifted Ford EcoSport is already pretty attractive due to its butch looks and an unmistakably SUV-ish look. However, Ford India offers a set of official accessories that make the EcoSport look even better. These include stylish roof rails and cross bars, sporty spare wheel cover, rear spoiler, illuminated scuff plates, window visors, sports pedals, many upholstery options and ambient interior lighting.

The Daybreak also offers some mechanical updates in the form of differential locks and an updated suspension.

Mahindra TUV300

While the TUV300 looks a bit utilitarian compared to cars like the Vitara Brezza, one simply can’t ignore the butch looks it has on offer. Mahindra is offering a handful of accessories that you can buy at the dealership level. These not only make the car look a bit more stylish but also give it a slightly distinct appearance. The accessories on offer include a chrome licence plate, ORVM, fog lamps, rear spoiler and illuminated scuff plate. There’s also a roof carrier and a cycle rack. Other than these accessories, the company also offers an Armour body kit that brings in an updated bumper, a bonnet hull, a side skirt, wheel arch cladding, HUD, sunblinds, rear entertainment package, rain visor and a rearview camera.

Mahindra Scorpio

The Mahindra Scorpio is easily among the most popular 7-seat SUVs available in India.

Mahindra’s official customisation department offers various modification options, some of which even convert the SUV into a rugged pick-up truck. The Scorpio gets flared wheel arches, a custom bull bar, custom wheels, wider tires, a removable lid for the cargo area and a roof-mounted spoiler. These changes help the Scorpio stand apart due to its highly rugged look.

Renault Kwid

The Kwid is easily the most stylish entry level car available in India. Its mini-me Duster looks make it really attractive and even make it look slightly costlier than it really is. The Kwid comes with as many as 6 official accessory packs that can make the hatchback look stand out. You can opt for various accessories like diamond cut alloy wheels, chrome grille, chrome tail lamp, chrome headlamp eyeliner, chrome fog lamps housing, chrome front bumper garnish, chrome bumper corner protector, chrome weather deflector, illuminated sill plate, chrome garnish on tailgate, bodyside cladding, rear bumper finisher, mud flaps, roof rails and chrome door handles.

Datsun RediGo

Even the RediGo, which is essentially a close relative of the Kwid, offers many customization options to choose from. Basically, there are 5 custom packs that are being offered by the company – Sporty, Premium, Kool, Urban and Style. Out of these, Style, Urban, and Kool bring in many accessories for the exterior, while the Premium and Sporty kits help you jazz up the interior. The exterior accessories include body side moulding, exhaust finisher, front under cover, rear under cover, DRLs, and a rear spoiler. The interior kits bring in new seat covers, trunk carpet, and new carpets.

Mahindra Bolero

Mahindra Customisations offers many versions of the rugged-looking Bolero. The one you see above is the Bolero Stinger. The Stinger gets a set of round headlamps and indicators instead of the regular rectangular headlamps. It also gets a rather chunky front bumper that carries a set of foglights near the registration plate housing. Also, like the modified Scorpio you see above, this modified Bolero has been given a dual-cab pickup layout. Mahindra also offers many other such customisation options for the Bolero.","Here is a list of as many as 15 cars and SUVs that can be customised even before you buy it.

Enosi levels the playing field in electricity retailing, thereby enabling communities, small businesses and startups to focus on value added clean energy.

Enosi has secured partnerships and agreements with various energy retailers and players in the industry including, California Clean Energy Foundation, Energy Locals, DC Power, Solar Analytics, Australian Photovoltaic Institute, and signed a cooperative research agreement with the University of New South Wales.

Electricity is the bedrock of modern day civilization, from cooking our food and heating our homes, to education and entertainment. However, there are problems associated with the energy sector, such as the rising costs and increased air pollution. To provide for the world’s growing energy demand, which underpins societal and technological progress, the Enosi Foundation has created a reliable and sustainable energy system for everyone. Enosi’s blockchain platform supports a new decentralised paradigm that alters the way we generate, transport, store and sell electricity.

Enosi transforms the energy market using the blockchain through a trusted and tokenized transaction platform. By commoditizing the components of the energy supply chain, broadening competition, and reducing barriers for entry, Enosi overcomes the inherent barriers to competition in the decentralised trading of renewable energy. This will lead to significantly lower costs in the sector. Enosi is opening up green energy adoption to the masses through community energy schemes where consumers are in control of their local electricity production and use..

Enosi’s open source blockchain operating system offers a variety of features to reduce costs and obstacles in the green energy market:

Enabling competition - Increasing competition within each segment of the supply chain by building a platform and providing tools that enable new entrants to participate in the market

- Increasing competition within each segment of the supply chain by building a platform and providing tools that enable new entrants to participate in the market Disaggregation - Separation of each segment in the electricity supply chain to allow the entry of more efficient market participants

It's a noble goal, as the best science tells us we must significantly slash fossil fuel consumption or else the planet faces dangerous climate change.

A number of academics believe it's not only feasible to wean off coal, natural gas and other polluting fuels by transitioning to renewable sources such as solar and wind power, it's even cost-effective.

Other researchers disagree, and this divide has spilled out into a spiraling debate, with each side pumping out more research to prove their positions. Last September, Australian scientist Benjamin Heard, an advocate for nuclear power, and his team published a critical review in the journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review that stated, ""there is no empirical or historical evidence"" that a 100 percent renewable electricity system is feasible.

Now, in a direct rebuttal published Thursday in the same journal, scientists concluded there are no roadblocks on the path to a clean energy future.

The authors of the new paper hail from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Delft University of Technology and Aalborg University.

In the earlier paper, Heard and his colleagues raised a number of questions, including whether renewables-based systems can survive extreme weather events or when the wind isn't blowing or when the sun isn't shining. They also questioned if the power grid could stay stable with such variable generation.

The scientists in the current paper responded to each critique after reviewing of dozens of existing studies and highlighting examples of successful grid operators around the world, from Denmark to Tasmania.

In the first scenario, during periods of extreme weather or when wind and solar energy fail or fall short, Brown and his team suggest imports, hydroelectricity, batteries and other storage methods. Or, in the "" worst-case solution,"" they said hydrogen or synthetic gas produced with renewable electricity could fill that gap. As for maintaining grid stability, they offered technical solutions, such as rotating grid stabilizers and newer electronics-based solutions.

""While several of the issues raised by the Heard paper are important, you have to realize that there are technical solutions to all the points they raised, using today's technology,"" said lead author Tom Brown of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in a statement.

""Furthermore,"" added Christian Breyer of Lappeenranta University of Technology, who co-authored the response, ""these solutions are absolutely affordable, especially given the sinking costs of wind and solar power.""

""There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible,"" noted Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University, another co-author of the response. ""Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let's get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose.""

After the paper was released, Heard, the lead author of the September paper, tweeted ""congratulations"" to Brown and his team for the publication and called it ""a tough journal.""

But it's clear the debate is not over yet. Brown added, ""There *is* something about the way all this 'possible and affordable' stuff, under a little scrutiny, demands massive additional research, subsidies, far-reaching policies interrelated across economic sectors, market reforms etc. AKA 'political will'""","Is it possible for the world to run on 100 percent renewable energy?

The report finds that the world is not on track to meet the targets set by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7—“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all,” which includes ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services and increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. The report indicates that while SDG 7 targets may not be met by 2030, significant progress is being made. Moreover, trends at the national and regional levels—especially in Africa—offer encouraging signals.

Mariama Sow Former Research Analyst - Africa Growth Initiative

The report finds that, for the first time in history, Africa’s electrification deficit is falling in absolute terms, i.e., there are fewer people without electricity. This result is largely due to the high performance of East African countries. For instance, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania expanded access to electricity by at least 3 percent of their population annually between 2010 and 2016.

Despite such progress, the continent still hosts the largest share of people without access to electricity. In fact, the total share has more than doubled, a trend particularly reflected in rural areas. Notably, Africa has seen significant population growth in the past decades, which may have affected the continent’s efforts in providing electricity to a large share of its population.

Off-grid solar electricity drives access in Africa

While lagging in terms of access to electricity, African countries are making strides in terms of access to renewable energy. In particular, the world has seen an uptake in the use of solar energy, the most popular form of clean energy, due largely to major gains in Asia and Africa (Figure B2.2.1.). Africa has the largest percent of the population that use off-grid solar energy among all regions, and the percentage of its total population that uses off-grid solar electricity has nearly quintupled since 2011. Today, 60 million people in Africa use off-grid solar power as an electricity source.

The joint report has developed a framework that evaluates sources of electricity based on three criteria—feasibility, suitability, and relevance. Energy sources that perform well in the three criteria are rated as Tier 1. Figure 2.15a below shows that many countries with solar access above Tier 1 are in Africa. Notably, in Uganda and Rwanda, more than 3 percent of the population is connected to an off-grid solar supply. When countries whose energy access below Tier 1 are considered, we see that many more African countries are providing electricity to a large share of their population through off-grid solar access (Figure 2.15b). Kenya is even electrifying more than 30 percent of its population through off-grid solar access.

In order to accelerate the progress, which has been made thus far, the report recommends bridging the funding gap and embracing new technologies as a solution to the existing electricity deficit in certain areas.","The report finds that the world is not on track to meet the targets set by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7—“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all,” which includes ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services and increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

The project—the highest valued in company history—will employ EnSync Energy’s innovative True Peer-to-Peer DC-Link technology to enable residents to directly exchange electricity with each other based on the energy needs of each individual unit, increasing energy efficiency and lowering electricity costs for the entire network.

Savings from the PPA will finance the construction of a 750-kW photovoltaic panel-covered canopy that will simultaneously produce energy and shade the development’s parking lot, as well as a 500-kWh energy storage system, with individual modules interconnected by the proprietary True Peer-to-Peer DC-Link behind each unit’s utility meter. The system will be managed by the EnSync DER Flex Internet of Energy monitoring and control platform.

The pioneering True Peer-to-Peer DC-Link technology results in dramatically increased energy efficiency across the network of residences. When a residential unit generates energy in excess of its load, it will charge the unit’s energy storage battery. Once the battery reaches full capacity, any additional energy generated then enters the DC-Link, a platform that interconnects individual residential units behind their utility meters and channels this electricity to other units in the network that demand more energy than they are generating or storing. The export and import from each unit is then metered and reported to the utility, though the True Peer-to-Peer network can also be deployed as a non-export system.

“True Peer-to-Peer revolutionizes the economics of solar plus energy storage in residential properties like Keahumoa, by dramatically reducing the negative impacts of vacancy rates, absence during peak generation times, vacation schedules and micro-loading effects within each unit from appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners,” said Brad Hansen, president and CEO of EnSync Energy. “By increasing efficiency across the peer network, the system lowers costs and makes solar energy financially accessible to residents of affordable housing. EnSync is particularly proud that our largest project to date in scope will also contribute to a clean energy future for all income levels, in Hawaii and elsewhere, with this technology and this project.”

“Hawaii is among the most expensive places to live in the United States,” said The Michaels Development Company Regional Vice President Karen Seddon. “We’re thrilled to collaborate with EnSync Energy on an innovative renewable energy program that matches our mission to create high-quality affordable housing by delivering reliable, low-cost electricity to our future residents.”

EnSync Energy is working on the project with Hawaiian Electric to interconnect the system to its grid in accordance with tariffs set by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. The utility will provide power to future Keahumoa residents as an on-demand back-up resource. In return, its grid will benefit from an aggregated, more stable load profile than those of most multi-residential units, which often generate fluctuating, inconsistent loads.

“Hawaii’s energy transformation enables Hawaiian Electric to implement innovations to build a leaner, greener grid that delivers renewable energy to all Hawaii residents,” said Colton Ching, senior vice president, planning & technology at Hawaiian Electric. “We look forward to working with EnSync Energy to implement its automated technology in Hawaii and make distributed energy resources affordable across income levels, facilitating widespread deployment of clean energy in the state.”

62,https://whyy.org/articles/philly-introduces-affordable-route-to-rooftop-solar/,"Tue, 22 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",WHYY,Philly introduces affordable route to rooftop solar,"Going solar becomes less expensive every year. Through federal and local programs and financing, homeowners might pay for solar installation in eight to 10 years of monthly payments equal to or lower than their typical electric bills. But the $15,000-plus needed up front to set solar panels on a roof and start producing energy still makes the cost prohibitive for many Philadelphians.

With an eye to improving access to sun-powered energy, Solarize Philly — a city group-buying program run by the Philadelphia Energy Authority — recently introduced a special pilot program bringing that upfront cost down to zero for 45 low- and moderate-income households. The program, rolled out in April, promises an additional 20 percent savings on monthly energy bills for those who participate.

“We know that many households can start saving money right away with solar,” said Emily Schapira, PEA’s executive director. “That’s why we launched the special financing option — to ensure everyone has access to this opportunity, not just the wealthy.”

The pilot program is part of the second phase of Solarize Philly, whose goal is to install solar panels on 500 city rooftops and create 75 green jobs by 2018. The citywide program, which seeks to entice homeowners by offering cheaper than market prices, consumer protections, and a faster process for obtaining city permits, is currently taking applications from households of all income levels, and is aiming for installations in the fall.

Of the 900 homeowners referred to solar installers through Solarize Philly last year, only 186 signed contracts. Although that number was still more than expected — and, according to PEA, meant 27 jobs created and placed Philadelphia as the fifth-fastest growing market in the U.S.— some homeowners could not move forward because they couldn’t qualify for financing.

“One of the main reasons to create this program is that low- and moderate-income households are the most energy-burdened in Philadelphia,” said Laura Rigell, PEA’s solar manager. “According to federal data, about 40 percent of households earning less than $60,000 per year and more than 50 percent of all minority households faced energy insecurity in 2015, meaning they’re struggling to pay their bills or sacrificing other household expense in order to pay their electricity bill because they face being shut off.”

To make solar affordable for low-income families in Philadelphia, PEA created a model in which a third entity — a legal liability corporation created by Solarize Philly — buys the solar panels needed for 45 houses and leases them to homeowners for 15 years. The monthly prices are 20 percent lower than what they currently pay for their electric bills.

“Instead of taking out a loan for the $15,000, they’re paying that amount over time — basically buying the power from the solar [panels] instead of buying it from PECO,” said Rigell. “And then, at the end of the 15 years, they’ll be able to own the solar.”

The third party allows PEA to obtain low-interest financing for households that would not be able to get loans individually, using a guarantee fund created with program fees collected in Solarize Philly’s first phase. The loans will be repaid through the monthly payments made by homeowners, or by the fund if homeowners fail to pay on their leases. Having a third party also allows PEA to take advantage of the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar installations applicable until 2019, cutting down the total cost.

Rigell said even PEA was surprised that the pilot worked without relying on a per-project subsidy, adding that the cost of solar has come down enough that it just makes sense economically.

“Initially, we were expecting that we had to use some of the program fees just to buy down the cost of individual projects,” Rigell said. “But when you take into account those [federal] tax benefits, it cancels out. It works in terms of the cash flow: We’re able to have them paying 20 percent less of what they would have been paying on the utility grid for electricity, and then we’re able to recoup that upfront investment.”

The pilot will benefit the first 45 households that meet PEA’s criteria. To qualify, an applicant must own the house, have a roof less than five years old (or one recoated in the last five years), meet PEA’s income guidelines — ranging from $18,090 to $46,600 for a household of one, to $43,170 to $71,900 for a household of five. An applicant must not be on PECO’s Customer Assistance Program, and must have paid PECO bills on time for the last 12 months.

To sign up for the program, residents can fill out a form on Solarize Philly’s website or visit the Energy Coordinating Agency Neighborhood Energy Centers all around the city. PEA will follow up to confirm eligibility and schedule a free solar assessment from any of the three local installers working with the program: Solar States, Solar by Kiss, and Moore Energy.

Matthew Reid, the Energy Coordinating Agency’s director of community programs, said one of the benefits of the solar program is that it is helping low-income families access clean energy — something not available to them before. But at the same time, he said, it’s challenging because the program’s requirements — having a new roof, a good payment history with PECO, and owning a house — exclude those who are more in need.

“It’s not for everyone, and that’s OK,” Reid said, estimating that, being optimistic, the program could benefit 25 percent of ECA’s clients. “But the fact that it is being presented to a community that has been overlooked is helpful and hopeful for many.”

PEA’s Rigell said the eligibility criteria had to be very strict for the pilot to work and show that the 45 households would repay. “We’re working with PECO now on potential solutions for renters and people below 150 percent of the federal poverty level, options like community solar, which is not currently allowed in Pennsylvania but would be a good solution for renters.”

After completing this pilot for 45 households, PEA plans to serve 1,000 by 2026.","But the $15,000-plus needed up front to set solar panels on a roof and start producing energy still makes the cost prohibitive for many Philadelphians.

Jackson Holtz UW News

The presidents of four Seattle-area universities and colleges have joined forces to declare May 14-18, 2018 as Affordable Housing Week on their campuses. Dr. Jeff Wagnitz, interim president of Highline College; Dr. Daniel J. Martin of Seattle Pacific University; Steven V. Sundborg, S.J., president of Seattle University; and Ana Mari Cauce, president of University of Washington, have signed proclamations or otherwise affirmed the importance of safe, healthy, affordable homes in communities of opportunity. The higher-education institutions join King County and 20 King County cities, including Seattle, in recognizing the benefits of affordable housing to everyone in the community.

Affordable Housing Week, now in its third year, is hosted by the Housing Development Consortium of Seattle-King County. This is the first time all four universities have participated; Seattle University was the first university to sign on, in the inaugural year, with Seattle Pacific University joining last year. The Seattle City Council and Mayor Jenny Durkan have signed this year’s proclamation, and King County is expected to sign at its meeting today.

President Sundborg, of Seattle University, notes that affordable housing is a major issue for universities in a booming region with ever-increasing housing costs. “In an expensive city like Seattle, access to affordable housing is an issue not only for students, but for faculty and staff as well,” he said. “We are pleased to be joined again by Seattle Pacific University, and to welcome Highline College and University of Washington, to this important advocacy effort on behalf of our campus communities.” The private Jesuit university on Capitol Hill this fall will open Vi Hilbert Hall, a new 10-story student residence hall and office building at the northeast corner of campus that will offer housing for 303 students.

University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce affirmed the commitment of our state’s largest university. “During Affordable Housing Week, we recommit to ensuring that our community thrives with opportunity, and that all people in it live with dignity in safe, healthy and affordable homes,” Cauce said.

Nationwide, an estimated 11 to 19 percent of students at four-year colleges are housing insecure. Almost half of all community college students face housing insecurity each year, with 13 to 14 percent experiencing homelessness. The housing shortage affects students county-wide, not only in Seattle, says Highline College Interim President Dr. Jeff Wagnitz.

“The impacts of housing insecurity are, if anything, more pronounced in regions like South King County,” says Dr. Wagnitz. “For Highline College, it’s imperative that we advocate for affordable housing solutions, both for our students and for our neighbors.”

Universities can serve a unique role in addressing our region’s housing needs. “Living in Seattle today and hosting Tent City 3 on our campus last winter emphasized the critical state of the challenges facing homelessness and affordable housing,” says Seattle Pacific University President Daniel J. Martin. “We must heighten our commitment so that all in our community can flourish, and we are committed to working with the city, county, and our fellow universities in moving forward on workable solutions through advocacy and service.”

As SPU’s Dr. Martin pointed out, Tent City 3 is one example of how Seattle-area universities have long worked to engage their campus communities in addressing the region’s homelessness state of emergency. All three universities have hosted tent cities on campus. Seattle University was the first university in the nation to host a tent city on campus in 2005, and Seattle Pacific University has hosted Tent City 3 three times at its campus on the north slope of Queen Anne Hill. The University of Washington hosted Tent City 3 in winter 2016-17. The Chronicle of Higher Education, the leading publication for higher-education institutions, recently published an op-ed by SPU professors about how the experience of hosting Tent City 3 changed their campus.

To recognize Affordable Housing Week, Seattle University’s Project on Family Homelessness will host the screening of “Central Division,” a student-produced documentary on gentrification of Seattle’s Central District, Tuesday, May 15, 7-9 p.m. A panel of community leaders and the audience will respond to the issues raised in the documentary. The event is free, and registration is encouraged.

International architecture firm Adjaye Associates submitted a beautiful multi-story timber structure that can be adapted to fit on a typical London terrace. The interior has an open floor plan that offers the ultimate in flexibility, and a large patio area provides natural light. The structure could be built as high as adjacent buildings to blend in with the existing architecture.

London-based designer Faye Toogood‘s concept envisions a simple single-unit volume with dual-pitched roofs, clad either in galvanized steel or charred timber. A light wood interior with an open floor plan would be illuminated with natural light thanks to large vertical windows.

London firm Carl Turner Architects submitted two designs for the project. The first is a one-story, extended bungalow with bright yellow skylights that flood the interior space with natural light.

The second design is a two-story townhouse, clad in brick and timber and topped with two separate pitched roofs that face two different directions. An open-air terrace between the roofs can serve as a rooftop garden or social space.

Lastly, Skene Catling de la Peña‘s proposal includes a stone-clad home with a timber interior. At the heart of the interior design is a vertical, green-tiled chimney with a cast-iron fireplace.

The Cube Haus project is committed to using these five innovative prototypes to create a portfolio of varied building types that can be scaled to size for larger, multi-family spaces or single-unit use. All of the buildings will be constructed with cross-laminated timber with components manufactured off-site in the UK.

To determine if one qualifies as an “applicable large employer” that must offer health care coverage, the employer must go through multiple steps to determine if they average 50 or more full-time employees and/or full-time equivalents over the course of the year.

Though the law grants an exemption for small seasonal employers, the rules—like different definitions of a seasonal worker and a seasonal employee—are burdensome and confusing.

The STARS Act harmonizes the definitions of seasonal worker and seasonal employee as a person hired for a position for which customary annual employment is six months or less. It also streamlines the complex calculation that employers must use to determine if they are applicable large employers.

“This simplified standard will reduce the administrative burden for seasonal employers and help them to comply with the ACA requirement to offer insurance coverage to full-time employees,” American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a letter to senators urging them to cosponsor the legislation.

The Farm Bureau-supported legislation was introduced by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Angus King (I-Maine). Similar legislation (H.R. 3956) was introduced in the House last year.","Recently introduced in the Senate, the Simplifying Technical Aspects Regarding Seasonality (STARS) Act of 2018 (S. 2670) provides much-needed clarification to the employer mandate’s seasonal worker exemption within the Affordable Care Act.

The first healthcare centre was set up in Ghaziabad, UP, in April 2016.Based out of Gurugram , NCR, the startup has a presence in six states— Uttar Pradesh , West Bengal, Haryana , Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar . “We have successfully ventured into the villages of India to provide consistent healthcare to the rural population at a cost they can afford, at a distance they can travel and with the dignity that they deserve,” says 57-year-old Khandheria. The medical services are availed via a health card which costs Rs 120 per year. “As we grow, the health card is going to be the means through which secondary services too will be delivered,” says Khandheria.Founded with an investment of about Rs 1.5 crore put in by Khandheria, currently Gramin Health Care is largely into primary healthcare services and is working to provide access to secondary and tertiary care as well. “Our vision is to make Gramin Health Care a one-stop healthcare and wellness facility,” says Khandheria. The startup generated a revenue of around Rs 1 crore in 2017-18 and expects a five-fold increase in 2018-19.The promise of Gramin Health Care prompted fertiliser major IFFCO to buy 26% stake in the startup in April 2017 for an undisclosed sum. “IFFCO provides us with the infrastructure for hosting permanent healthcare delivery units,” says Khandheria. Gramin Health Care, with the help of IFFCO, has set up more than 100 clinics across six states and has conducted over 4,800 health camps.Last month, it conducted about 700 health camps. “Each of our clinic organises 6-7 camps a month, so as we open more clinics we’ll be conducting many more camps a month,” says Khandheria. Besides it own clinics, the startup has been aggregating hospitals and other healthcare providers for offering secondary care. “They have agreed to provide their services to our patients at highly discounted rates,” says Khandheria.The biggest challenge this startup faced was bringing the right kind of technology and trained human resources to the rural areas. “We also had the toughest market to capture, which many larger organisations haven’t been able to explore successfully,” says Khandheria. Another challenge for the startup was to get more women nurses to work with Gramin Health Care. “Male nurses, although easier to hire, were not the right choice for reaching out to farmers’ families as we found that female nurses performed better, particularly when treating women,” says Khandheria.Managing operations remotely from health centres and its base office at Gurgaon was also a challenge the startup had to negotiate. “We were able to overcome our challenges by not just delivering on our patients’ expectations, but actually exceeding them. Additionally, IFFCO being our strategic partner and shareholder, has been helpful,” says Khandheria.Gramin Health Care aims to touch 10 million families in the next five years but is finding it tough to change consumer behaviour to avail institutionalised health care. “Change in behaviour is generally a long and hard process and, when it comes to the rural healthcare consumer, it is even more challenging. But we are developing models and processes that would allow us to scale up faster,” says Khandheria.","“Our vision is to make Gramin Health Care a one-stop healthcare and wellness facility,” says Khandheria.

More than 200 women raised money and — over a six-day span — swung hammers at a site in west Calgary’s Bowness neighbourhood to help build homes for people in need.

Their tasks included framing interior and exterior walls, basements, backframing, digging fence post holes, and building decks. It was all part of Habitat for Humanity Southern Alberta’s Women Build event.

“We learned a lot of new skills,” says Stephanie Chapman, marketing and communications specialist for Excel, which was not only one of the companies that had a group participate in the construction, but it also served as title sponsor for the event for the second consecutive year, as well. “It was a great experience.”

This was Chapman’s second time participating in Women Build.

“It’s a nice a change to be out on site and see what our field staff do every day,” she says. And unlike at their day jobs, where they work in an office setting, and aren’t necessarily in constant contact on every task — here many of the construction duties were done together, says Chapman, adding: “I feel like we kind of connect on a different level.”","Women help build Habitat homes from the ground upReviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected.

The redesign, made in response to a rapidly changing market, includes expanding the incentives, supporting larger solar projects and encouraging development in a greater variety of locations, including brownfields, landfills and at affordable housing locations. The NY-Sun program supports Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s mandate for 50 percent of the state’s electricity from renewable resources by 2030.

Alicia Barton, president and CEO of NYSERDA said, “Solar energy is a key component of Governor Cuomo’s nation-leading commitment to 50 percent renewable energy by 2030, and the NY-Sun initiative redesign will help ensure we keep the momentum going in New York’s fast-growing solar market. New solar projects are being constructed across the state faster than ever before, bringing clean energy and solar jobs to communities in every region of New York.”

The NY-Sun Megawatt Block program has already supported 652 megawatts of completed projects and another 979 megawatts are currently under development. The Megawatt Block has provided a stable, transparent incentive structure for project developers since it was introduced in 2014. The redesign represents a continued commitment by the state to ensure the growth of the evolving solar industry and the program revisions are the result of ongoing coordination with New York’s solar developers and stakeholders.

The incentive program is divided into three regions across New York: the LIPA/PSEG-Long Island service territory, the Consolidated Edison service territory, and Upstate. The incentive steps down over time based on market activity by sector and region.

The program revisions encourage the development of new projects by accelerating payments and providing new financial incentive “adders.” Development in limited use areas, projects built on brownfield or landfill sites, on rooftop or parking canopies in ConEd territory, and at affordable housing will now be eligible for a higher incentive. Reducing the energy burden of low-income households and preserving New York’s valuable agricultural land are priorities of Governor Cuomo’s Reforming the Energy Vision strategy, which is building a cleaner, more resilient and affordable energy system for all New Yorkers.

To encourage solar deployment for business owners, the revisions also increase the project size limit of the non-residential incentive program to 750 kilowatts from 200 kilowatts. The maximum system size for commercial and industrial projects was recently increased to 7.5 megawatts. The increased size caps further support project development by allowing greater economies of scale.

A robust sector of the New York solar industry is in community solar projects. Eighteen community solar projects have been completed statewide and more than 600 megawatts are under development.

Community solar offers greater access to solar through community-based projects by allowing residents and businesses who may or may not own property or have room to install solar panels at their location to subscribe to a local community solar project. Subscribers still have energy delivered through their regular electric provider while the power produced from the solar array is fed directly back to the electric grid. The grid is supplied with clean, renewable energy while subscribers get credit on their electric bills.

NY-Sun is Governor Cuomo’s $1 billion initiative to advance the scale-up of solar and move the state closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry. Since 2011, solar in New York State has increased more than 1,000 percent and leveraged nearly $2.8 billion in private investments. NY-Sun will deploy at least 3 gigawatts of capacity by 2023. There are more than 12,000 people engaged in solar jobs across New York.

The company has developed technology at its plant in British Columbia that can both remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into carbon-neutral fuels, suggesting such technology could be a meaningful part of the fight against climate change.

In a paper published Thursday in Joule, they estimated the costs of scaling up their operation to be $94 to $232 per ton of carbon dioxide captured. This is much cheaper, and more feasible, than some theoretical estimates that have put the costs of scaling up carbon capture technology at $1,000 per ton of carbon dioxide.

""If these costs are real, it is an important result,"" senior Carnegie Institution for Science scientist Ken Caldeira, who was not involved in the research, told The Atlantic. ""This opens up the possibility that we could stabilize the climate for affordable amounts of money without changing the entire energy system or changing everyone's behavior.""

The paper claims to be the first to provide a cost estimate for a carbon-capture system that is both based on technology commonly used in commercial engineering and described in enough detail that readers can adequately assess the results for themselves.

""After 100 person-years of practical engineering and cost analysis, we can confidently say that while air capture is not some magical cheap solution, it is a viable and buildable technology for producing carbon-neutral fuels in the immediate future and for removing carbon in the long run,"" study lead author, Harvard University applied physics professor and Carbon Engineering founder David Keith said in a Cell Press release published in ScienceDaily.

The technology works by sucking air into cooling tower-like structures with fans. The acidic carbon dioxide is attracted to an alkaline liquid within the towers that is then taken into the factory where acid and base are separated. The carbon-dioxide containing liquid is frozen and then reheated into a slurry that is combined with hydrogen to make liquid fuels like gasoline and jet fuel.

Keith told The Atlantic that the immediate commercial application of the technology would be to create new fuels that would recycle existing carbon dioxide instead of adding new emissions into the atmosphere. Storing the carbon is also possible, but there isn't yet any market for this service.

Instead, the technology could help the transportation sector, responsible for around 20 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, transfer over to renewable energy and fuel.

""Electricity from solar and wind is intermittent; we can take this energy straight from big solar or wind installations at great sites where it's cheap and apply it to reclaim and recycle carbon dioxide into new fuel,"" Keith told Cell Press. ""Making fuels that are easy to store and transport eases the challenge of integrating renewables into the energy system,"" he said.

Keith was quick to point out that he didn't see his technology as an excuse to stop trying to reduce emissions the conventional way, but rather as a means of supporting and supplementing this process.

""My view is we should stick to trying to cut emissions first. As a voter, my view is it's cheaper not to emit a ton of [carbon dioxide] than it is to emit it and recapture it,"" he told The Atlantic.","Scientists at the Canadian company Carbon Engineering have moved carbon-capture technology one step closer from pipe dream to viable solution.

(Nasdaq:RUN), the nation’s largest residential solar, storage and energy services company, is improving access to home solar in Florida by offering solar-as-a-service and its Brightbox home battery. Beginning June 7th, Floridians will be able to lease solar equipment that enables them to create their own solar electricity year-round using their rooftop, as well as the Brightbox home battery system, that keeps lights on during power outages this hurricane season.



Sunrun is the first national company in the Sunshine State to offer Floridians solar-as-a-service, providing access to solar for as little as zero upfront. Sunrun’s solar-as-a-service product in Florida is an affordable, easy, and reliable way for people to power their homes without dealing with the upfront cost of solar panels, equipment, and installation. Sunrun also fully maintains and insures the system, offering households an accessible and hassle-free option for going solar.

Home solar is expected to continue its expansion in Florida through this offering, with Sunrun aiming to bring hundreds of jobs to the state in the coming years.

“Freedom is a value Americans hold dear. In offering Floridians solar-as-a-service, households in the Sunshine State are given the freedom to make, control, and store their own energy,” said Lynn Jurich, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Sunrun. ""Unfortunately, too many Floridians have experienced first hand the effects of extreme weather and power outages. Home solar and batteries provide peace of mind and backup power when disaster strikes, keeping food fresh and the lights on.”

“Affordable and resilient, home solar also contributes to a healthier environment for households and communities across the state. Home solar is already playing a major role in America’s future energy system, and Sunrun is thrilled to lead the industry as Florida embraces this technology.”

In addition to solar-as-a-service, Sunrun will also begin offering its home solar and battery system, Brightbox. Brightbox provides backup electricity to households in the event of a power outage. During Hurricane Irma, more than 15 million Floridians lost power. This translates to more than 70 percent of the state’s population. In total, there were more than 14 collective days without power in Florida in 2017, coming from 79 individual outages. Brightbox enables households to power through storms and outages.

Unlike a generator, Brightbox is recharged daily by the sun and reliably delivers clean electricity. This home battery system can replace noisy natural gas or diesel generators commonly used for backup power, and could have significant health and community benefits in Florida.

“Sunrun’s new solar lease will give Central Florida residents greater access clean energy choices, lower energy costs, and continued momentum for local job growth in our state’s renewable energy market,” State Senator Linda Stewart (D-Orlando) said. “This is the Sunshine State and Floridians should be able to take full advantage of an abundant, emissions-free energy source that contributes to a healthier community while remaining affordable.”



“As an advocate for consumer choice, I am excited to see new options for Floridians that will make solar more affordable and accessible to residents across the state,” said State Senator Jeff Brandes (R-St. Petersburg). “With our population projected to grow by five million people by 2030, the time for Floridians to invest in energy diversity is now.”

With more than 3,200 employees, 189,000 customers, and a presence in 23 states and the District of Columbia, Sunrun is the largest residential solar and energy services company in the United States. Sunrun is pleased to now be able to offer more Floridians access to solar.

Sunrun will continue to sell solar systems and Brightbox, as well as offer solar-as-a-service. Solar-as-a-service and Brightbox will be immediately available in the TECO, Duke and OUC service areas, with plans to expand into the rest of the state shortly. For more information, visit Sunrun’s plans and services page or call 1-888-GoSolar (1-888-467-6527).

78,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2018/0614/One-company-s-plan-to-create-affordable-green-housing-in-Nigeria,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Christian Science Monitor,One company's plan to create affordable green housing in Nigeria,"Rapid urbanization has forced millions of Nigerians to live in slums and squatter settlements, as the country’s population is growing faster than its ability to build new housing. Today, more than 80 percent of Nigerians live in substandard housing conditions, and many lack access to electricity.

However, for some, relief is on the way thanks to a company called Comprehensive Design Services (CDS). The company caters to people who would not otherwise have access to home ownership. It seeks to improve the living standard of Nigerians by providing affordable houses, reliable renewable energy, clean water, and recycling strategies.

CDS was launched by architect and social entrepreneur Chinwe Ohajuruka, who was the sub-Saharan African Laureate of the Cartier Women's Initiative Awards in 2015. “Comprehensive Design Services aims to turn challenges in the Nigerian built environment into opportunities,” she says.

In 2012 CDS was one of 17 winners (out of 495 entries) in the African Diaspora Marketplace Business Plan Competition in the United States. Between 2013 and 2015, CDS built 12 affordable green housing units in the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt.

“People’s lives have been changed for the better because eight families now live in decent homes with access to clean water, improved sanitation, and renewable energy. More importantly, they now live with dignity,” Ms. Ohajuruka says.

The group is currently preparing to build its next multi-housing development comprising approximately 40 small homes including studios, one-, and two-bedroom houses.

Last year, Nigeria’s minister of Power, Works, and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said that factors working against home ownership in Nigeria include the high cost of land, lack of financing, high interest rates, high material and construction costs, and delays in obtaining titles to land and buildings.

Ohajuruka says that few housing developers are interested in affordable housing, as the profit margins are small. “We have seen a need, and have developed ways to build decent housing quickly, affordably, and sustainably,” she says. “We are trying to lead by example, to improve the lives of Nigerians with simple, sustainable housing. We are trying to tackle large, complex problems with simplified solutions, one home at a time. We design, engineer, and build compact homes that are self-cooling, solar-powered, and water-sufficient. They combat climate change in a natural and groundbreaking way.”

She explains that the technology, called bioclimatic design, is quite simple.

“It means designing and engineering the buildings to suit the climate by going back to first principles: keep out the sun, rain, and insects; maximize natural ventilation and natural lighting; raise the building off the ground for flood prevention and control, and capture rainwater where possible,” Ohajuruka says. Water comes from underground boreholes, pumped using solar power.

“We have the best climate in the world, but our buildings have become hot, stuffy, and dark, requiring fans and air conditioners,” says Ohajuruka. “We should work with the climate in the design of buildings and not against it.”

She explains that CDS did not invent the technology; the country’s traditional architecture was better suited to the climate than many modern buildings. “We simply revived and modernized traditional architecture principles. We are not the only ones doing it in Nigeria. There are many climate-conscious architects who are doing similar and better work.”

Initially funded with a grant from USAID and Western Union Foundation, CDS is now working to raise funds from the private sector. Ohajuruka says that CDS’s constructions typically cost 25 to 50 percent less to build than similar homes in similar regions, and consume 50 to 75 percent less energy. “That is why they are called affordable and green. The cost varies according to the quantity: The more we build, the cheaper they become because of economies of scale.”

Nonetheless, she notes that it will take a major effort to curb the country’s housing crisis. “I am of the opinion that we have to do much more if we hope to close the 17 million housing unit deficit. Sustainable thinking will have to be deployed on a massive scale,” she says.

Over the long term, Ohajuruka’s goal is to replicate the model across sub–Saharan Africa.

At least 150 million people, or about 2 per cent of the world’s population, are homeless, according to United Nations data. About 1.6 billion people—more than a fifth of the global population—lack adequate housing.

Many of them live in cities, where the high cost of owning or renting a home forces them to live on the streets or in shanties lacking even basic amenities.

This is especially true of Hong Kong, one of the wealthiest cities in the world, where tens of thousands cram into rooftop shanties, so-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, and tiny partitioned flats, averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq mt).

One architecture firm in the city believes it has a solution: micro homes in concrete water pipes.

“ We need a quantum leap in affordability, speed, and quality to reach homeless families exponentially faster. Roni Chan, spokesperson, Council of Social Service

James Law Cybertecture has remade pipes, measuring 2.5 metres in diameter, into 100 sq ft apartments for two, with a living and kitchen space, a shower and a toilet.

These “OPods” can be stacked up to four levels between highrises and under flyovers and other idle spaces, and easily moved to different sites, said chief executive James Law.

They can be mass produced quickly, with each costing about HK$120,000 ($15,000), about a third the cost of a regular 100 sq ft apartment, he said, adding that he is seeking government approval.

“The OPod cannot be a long term solution,” he said.

“However, it can be a way to challenge our society to respond using innovative and daring solutions to the affordable housing problem,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Also in Hong Kong, demand for shipping-container homes has surged as they are seen as a stopgap solution for those waiting for public housing, and for young people who cannot afford to buy their own flat.

The average wait time for a public housing flat is about five years, with more than 300,000 people on the list.

A local non-profit, the Council of Social Service, is building container homes for families on the waiting list, on land loaned by developer Henderson Land.

Ninety such flats, measuring between 143 sq ft and 287 sq ft, will be ready next year, and are modelled after container homes for students in Amsterdam, said spokeswoman Roni Chan.

“Public rental housing is currently the only permanent and decent option, but it takes time. Short-term and long-term solutions have become increasingly important,” she said.

Elsewhere, tiny 20-square-metre homes are being built in gardens to accommodate refugees.

Hi-tech homes

But a viable solution to the affordable housing crisis in developing countries may come from the social enterprise or non-profit sector, aided by new technologies.

The U.S.-based non-profit New Story, and the construction technology firm ICON, are developing a 3D printer that can print a 600-800 sq ft home in under 24 hours for less than $4,000.

The homes are expected to last as long, or longer than, standard concrete homes, and the printer is designed to work under rugged conditions such as irregular power and running water supplies, said New Story co-founder Alexandria Lafci.

The companies are making the first 3D printed community of homes in El Salvador this year, and will then partner with other non-profits and governments across the world, she said.

“We need a quantum leap in affordability, speed, and quality to reach homeless families exponentially faster,” she said.

“Instead of waiting for profit motivation to bring construction advances to (developing nations), we are fast tracking innovations like 3D technology that can be a powerful tool toward ending homelessness.”

Bike-sharing seems to have become a buzzword this year. Since the end of 2017, the number of players entering the bike-sharing space in India has been growing, and with good reason. With the growing traffic snarls, trying to reach somewhere fast is often quicker on bicycles.

However, India is still a new market for bike sharing. Until last year, bike sharing was a big game in China and the US, with Chinese bike-sharing unicorn Ofo and New York-based player Citi Bike leading the way. But now, India is in a position that has made it the next market to conquer, not just for the Chinese titans, but for homegrown startups too.

According to media reports, the bicycle market in India is worth $1.2 billion, and production currently stands at 15 million units. The key players in the space are:

Ola Pedal and Zoomcar PEDL

Last year, Ola, India’s ride-hailing unicorn announced the launch of Ola Pedal. Aiming to offer easy last-mile connectivity, especially for trips that were too short for a taxi and too long for a walk, Ola Pedal had piloted on IIT Kanpur campus.

In November 2017, Zoomcar, the Bengaluru-based car rental platform, launched PEDL, its cycle-sharing vertical in Bengaluru’s HSR Layout. According to Greg Moran, Co-founder and CEO, Zoomcar, the ratio of population to motorised vehicles in most urban cities has reached unsustainable levels resulting in clogged roads, bad air quality, and reduced productivity. The company is looking to expand its cycle-sharing vertical across the city, and the country.

Yulu

Founded by Amit Gupta, Co-founder of mobile advertising platform Inmobi, Yulu offers IoT-based bicycle-sharing solutions to resolve last-mile connectivity. According to Amit, big personal vehicles should be replaced with smaller and efficient clean energy vehicles. “These vehicles also need to be scalable and shareable so that the overall cost of ownership is low and the utilisation is very high,” says Amit.

To operate Yulu, users need to install the app and load their wallets using Paytm, UPI, credit cards or debit cards. The platform works on a pay-per-use model, where users will be billed for every 30 minutes of use. Yulu also generates revenue from advertising on bicycles and data from its usage.

Ofo Bike sharing company

Letscycle

A stationless cycle-sharing app, Letscycle was launched last year to provide a cheaper and easier last-mile commute option in urban areas.

Each bicycle has a QR code and a cycle number. Users get an unlock code on the app, through which they can unlock the cycle. They can then ride the cycle to the required destination and drop it there. They then lock the cycle, which is available for other people to ride.

The team is launching more cycles in cities it already has a presence in like Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chandigarh. It claims to have over 140 cycles and more than 500 users.

Mobycy

Mobycy allows one to rent a bicycle by the hour and, after use, it can be parked anywhere for others to pick up and use. Mobycy bikes are now available across public places like Delhi metro stations, North and South Campus of the Delhi University, and the Huda City Centre.

The Mobycy app shows the user bikes in the vicinity. After use, the cycles can be parked anywhere at public pavements, except inside private compounds or gated colonies. The app has a smart GPRS-tracking device installed to prevent thefts. Founded by former MobiKwik VP Akash Gupta and former S&P Capital IQ executive Rashi Agarwal in 2017, the company has raised $5,00,000 in seed funding.

Ofo and Mobike

Bicycle-sharing startup Mobike was acquired by China’s Meituan Dianping, and Ofo started as a campus bike-sharing platform. Ofo, which is present in 21 countries, claims to have clocked over 1.1 million rides in just 10 weeks of operations in India. Globally, it has 32 million rides per day, of which 30 million are in China. It has 10 million bikes globally. While Ofo launched in Magarpatta township in Pune, Mobike is set to launch in Kothrud.

Mobike has over nine million bicycles currently operating in over 200 cities across 16 countries. With India, Mobike enters its 17th country of operations in just over two years of inception.","Since the end of 2017, the number of players entering the bike-sharing space in India has been growing, and with good reason.

Starting out in the early 1990s she designed her first handbag, playfully named “The Sam”. The Sam, a boxy tote, was functional but also a perfect first example of her clear design aesthetic.

At the time, the women’s handbag market was dominated by fairly generic, often dull, reasonably priced bags at one end, and luxury designer handbags with the accompanying hefty price tag at the other. Spade cleverly identified a gap in the market, and as it turns out, this was rather lucrative.

In today’s terms, her early handbags were priced around the US$300 mark, making them affordable for young professional women who wanted more than the cheaper offerings but couldn’t afford the more traditional, high end designers. In fact many women on social media are remembering the first time they bought a Kate Spade handbag as a time they made their first “adult” purchase.

In addition to the more affordable prices, Spade’s designs offered delightful, often quirky, whimsical touches. She adored glitter, polka dots, ruffles, stripes. She also brought back a bold colour palette to the rather drab 1990s fashion trends. She used strong and striking colours – yellow, fuschia, apple green, red - often paired with gold and black and white stripes. Her natural colour instincts were on show in all her designs and her ability to pair odd colour and texture combinations was pure genius.

Spade made it ok, if not desirable, to wear a mouse handbag, or to carry a typewriter tote. Hot pink and red together were the go and she encouraged us, as one line of her range stated, to “eat cake for breakfast”.

Many of us own at least one Kate Spade item, a handbag, a pair of shoes, sunglasses or a watch. Perhaps these items are authentic, perhaps not. One of the downsides to her design and manufacturing success was that Kate Spade products, particularly the handbags, were of such a clean and simple design that they became the targets of counterfeiters. A stroll down Canal Street in Manhattan would offer a giddy array of Kate Spade knockoffs at very cheap prices. The really good counterfeited pieces were often hard to tell from the original.

Spade epitomised the archetypal New York “girl” and her designs both reflected this aesthetic and appealed to those who aspired to this status.

But as is often the case with archetypal New Yorkers, she wasn’t actually born in Manhattan. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she worked for a time as the accessories editor at the now-closed Mademoiselle magazine. She then started what was to become a fashion accessories empire, with her husband to be, Andy Spade. Although the business still bears her name, she sold the majority of the business to Neiman Marcus in 1999.

As a testament to the strength of her brand, many people were unaware that she sold the Kate Spade business - they assumed even quite recently that she was still in charge and still designing. In fact, Spade hadn’t owned her namesake’s business for over a decade, selling her remaining 44% stake to Neiman Marcus in 2006.

However, as she walked away from leading her business in 2006, the brand struggled. In 2015, now known as Kate Spade & Company, the brand’s new, lower-priced range for 25-35-year olds failed. One can only imagine where the company would be today if Kate herself was still running it.

Despite selling the original business years earlier, Kate continued to design, and in 2016 she launched a new business called Frances Valentine, which produced shoes, handbags and accessories.

Her death by apparent suicide seems in marked contrast to Spade’s delightful, playful designs, which truly epitomised the word “happy”.

Her legacy will live on and her contribution to fashion is being recognised with glowing tributes. On social media, many are sharing pictures and memories of their favourite Kate Spade pieces – the most popular word being used? Happy.

Just in time for the busy summer travel season, The Bernic Hotel will be joining Hilton’s Tapestry Collection in June 2018. The hotel will be the first New York City property in the growing collection of boutique hotels, each with a unique identity and décor shaped by its respective setting and location. All must meet consistent quality standards established by Hilton across the brand.

Combining the best of both worlds

When traveling to a high-cost destination like New York City, budget-conscious visitors often opt for hotel stays at cookie-cutter chains, sacrificing charm and “personality” for affordability. The Bernic Hotel, nestled in the heart of Manhattan, promises the best of both worlds: an intimate, boutique hotel experience at a moderate-for-New-York-City price.

Centrally located on East 47th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues (Midtown East), the hotel is a short walk from Grand Central Station, The Theater District and Times Square. Owner-operated, this “new-build” hotel first opened its doors in September 2016.

The building exterior, as well as its 96 rooms and suites, have a clean, contemporary look; some guestrooms have small balconies. And from top to bottom, there’s plenty packed inside the 22-story hotel’s modest footprint.

A peek inside

The ambiance is casual, not fussy. The popular Allora restaurant serves traditional northern Italian fare with an inventive twist. Alto, the rooftop bar open from May to October, offers panoramic city views. In the lobby, guests can sip complimentary Prosecco during happy hour between 5-7PM local time.

Light-filled guestrooms with double-paned, floor-to-ceiling windows offer a quiet and relaxing respite from the vibrant streets of the city that never sleeps.

The interior décor is understated, complemented by luxury amenities generally found only in more expensive hotels, including comfortable Stearns and Foster mattresses; Nespresso coffeemakers; minibars; rainfall showers; heated bathroom floors; in-room safes and upscale Beekman 1802 toiletries.

The Bernic emphasizes personal service. Concierge services, turndown, and room service are available to guests as well as complimentary access to the New York Health & Racquet Club. Tech-savvy travelers appreciate 43-inch plasma TVs, free Wi-Fi and an abundance of electrical outlets to charge devices. Valet parking is available at an additional cost.

Rates start from $189 per night, double-occupancy, but can vary widely by date of stay and room category. (Check out specific rates on The Bernic website.)

The Tapestry Collection by Hilton

The first property in the Tapestry Collection was launched in Syracuse, New York, about one year ago. There are now six one-of-a-kind hotels in the rapidly expanding portfolio with more than 30 properties in the pipeline.

As part of the growing family of 14 distinct Hilton brands, Tapestry Collection guests are able to take advantage of Hilton Honors, an award-winning guest loyalty program, and accumulate redeem loyalty points for their stays. Hilton Honors members can check in using Digital Key, and choose a room in advance of their stay via a smartphone.

Not bad, just very average so there's nothing at all memorable about most of them.

When I popped on these Creative Aurvana Trio headphones my ears perked right up, however. The sound was anything but ordinary. The clarity and open quality was special, and truly remarkable for a headphone that retails for $150 (£130).

Enlarge Image Creative

The Trio is, naturally enough, a three-way design, with two balanced armature drivers and one bio-cellulose low frequency driver in each earpiece. You get three different sizes of silicone ear tips, and a pair of foam tips, and I found the Trio's angled earpieces unusually comfortable. The user-replaceable cables, with inline one button remote and microphone is compatible with iOS and Android phones. The cables are designed to hang straight down, not go up and over your ears. The headphone comes with a one year warranty and a hard carry case.

I started listening to the Trio with R.E.M.'s first album Murmur, it felt downright jaunty, the band is so limber and free, and Michael Stipe's vocals were assured. The Trio made the most of the music.

The Isle of Dogs film soundtrack unleashed an army of drums and percussion instruments pounding inside my head, in a good way. It's an usually good sounding recording I use to suss out the differences between headphones. In this case the Trio and the 1More Triple Driver ($100) that also uses two balanced armature drivers and a dynamic driver in each earpiece. Both headphones were exceptional in the portrayal of the big bass drums, but the Trio pulled ahead with the clarity of the sound of the chanting male chorus, and the wood blocks, high bells and other percussion instruments. The Trio's superlative transparency made all the difference in this showdown.

I also noted I could listen at fairly quiet volume levels and still hear extraordinary detail. Mind you the Trio doesn't rely on overemphasized treble to create a false impression of detail, it just sounds very neutral and pure at any volume.

One issue that bothered me was the Trio has one of the more tangle prone cables I've used, even when I took time to carefully wrap the cables after each use I still had to spend a minute or two detangling them before I could start listening again. Noise isolation on the NYC subway was a little below average for this type of headphone.

I fell for the Creative Aurvana Trio big time, because it checked all of the audiophile boxes: It's transparent, spacious, bass is clean, treble is unhyped and pure, it's all good. But if you're hankering for big and boomy bass and overly crisp highs the Trio might sound a tad bland. As always sound quality is a matter of taste, and the Trio was mighty tasty for me.","I get a lot of headphones to try out, but don't be jealous, most aren't all that interesting.

Either you spend a ridiculous amount of money on a full-featured smartphone that fits your needs, or you save cash and sacrifice elements that you hope you aren’t going to need. For years now, OnePlus has been working to perfect its formula of mixing the two. This year, I think they nailed it once again.

HARDWARE |

OnePlus delivered its first Android smartphone, the OnePlus One, with a design that was extremely unique in the market. In the years since, a lot of that uniqueness has faded away, but each device still has the feeling of being a OnePlus device. Last year’s OnePlus 5 did bore an uncanny resemblance to a certain fruit phone, but the OnePlus 6 starts to stands out, at least a little bit.

With the OnePlus 6, the company has adopted the glass back and metal frame which has been taking over the industry. OnePlus’ take on this design isn’t all that different on the surface, but the one trick the company does have up its sleeve is a matte finish.

The “Mirror Black” finish I reviewed is basically the same as the rest of the pack, but the matte “Midnight Black” and “Silk White” colors are unique (at least until Google probably does the same). They mix the feel of glass without the fingerprints that we’ve been complaining about for years. It’s a great solution if you ask me, and I’d definitely go for that variant if I were to buy the phone personally (fingers crossed on a red color as well).

Of course, with these materials, you’re going to get a phone that feels great in the hand, which the OnePlus 6 does. The use of these materials also results in a phone that looks and feels premium too, regardless of the variant you get.

The rounded back gives off a clean look, that is until you pick it up or put it in your pocket. At that point, the “Mirror Black” color just gets covered in dust and fingerprints. Thankfully, OnePlus offers a sweet selection of cases for the phone. I particularly enjoyed the new Nylon Black bumper case which offered a ton of extra grip and protection.

DISPLAY |

One highlight for me of the OnePlus 6 has been its display. Like the 5T that came before it, this phone has a gorgeous OLED panel on board with vibrant colors. The brightness is still a bit of a sore point outdoors for me, but it’s fully acceptable for the most part.

Of course, the biggest conversation around the display is that of the notch. Yes, it’s here, but no, I don’t think it’s actually a problem. While I’d be fully on board with sticking with a OnePlus 5T-esque look, the notch is something I don’t mind, and it really can make a difference in screen real estate.

As the company has previously mentioned, raising the corners of the display allows for the status bar to take up less usable real estate on the screen itself, meaning your apps, games, and videos are able to use more of the display. It’s not an ideal solution, obviously, but it undeniably gets the job done. Plus, OnePlus seems to handle this better than anyone else. The status bar layout makes sense, and very few apps have been affected by the notch in use. Further, the “chin” at the bottom is very slim, so it doesn’t feel annoying that OnePlus used both.

Long story short, the display is great and the notch really shouldn’t be a deal-breaker on the OnePlus 6. I’m sure many reading this will happily argue with that viewpoint, so I’ll look forward to that debate in the comments section below.

SOFTWARE & PERFORMANCE |

A strong point for each and every OnePlus device to date has been the software, and the OnePlus 6 is no different. OxygenOS comes out of the box with Android Oreo on this phone, and it runs like a dream.

First off, let’s talk about OnePlus’ software build here. At a glance, you wouldn’t be mistaken if you thought this phone ran a stock build of Android, but OxygenOS actually improves on that in a few big ways.

The biggest improvement is in its customizability. You can do and change just about everything in OxygenOS, from the accent colors to activating a true dark theme. There are settings to tweak even little things like what buttons do on multiple taps, various gestures, and even icons you see in the status bar. Simply put, it’s fantastic.

One slightly odd note that I wanted to point out, though, is that OnePlus doesn’t offer a notification gesture on the OnePlus 6. For a while now, many devices from Google’s Pixel to Samsung’s Galaxy S9 have offered an option to swipe the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notification shade, but the OnePlus 6 doesn’t. That’s especially odd considering the OnePlus 5T did offer that functionality.

With a Snapdragon 845, 8GB of RAM, and speedy UFS 2.1 storage on the OnePlus 6, you’d expect a killer performance package, and that’s exactly what the phone offers. The OnePlus 6 never fails me in performance, whether that’s switching back and forth between a bunch of applications, or playing a resource intensive game like ARK Survival Evolved. It truly never skips a beat.

One other thing I have to give OnePlus credit for is fixing the Alert Slider as well. On the OnePlus 5T I enjoyed the functionality, but on the OnePlus 6, it’s actually useful. Finally, this feature actually adjusts between the ringer, vibrate, and silent. It works great, and it truly comes in handy.

Overall, the OnePlus 6’s software is great. It’s user-friendly, clean, and timely updates are something you can mostly expect from OnePlus. There’s even an Android P Beta already live. OxygenOS is simply the standard for good third-party software on Android.

However, not all is perfect, as bugs aren’t uncommon. I’ve noticed a handful of UI bugs on my device, and my colleague Dylan has noted several strange, completely random issues on his unit as well. These can likely be fixed through updates, but they don’t really take away from the experience all that much.

BATTERY LIFE & CHARGING |

It does all of this with killer battery life in tow as well. There’s a 3,300 mAh battery inside of the OnePlus which, while not insanely massive, easily powers me through a full day of use. Generally, use for me kicks off around 7:30am, and by the end of the day, I usually get around 4-5 hours of screen time before plugging it in to top up at midnight. At that point, the battery is usually down to about 15-20% remaining, if not a little less. Obviously, your mileage will vary, but I’ve been totally satisfied with the endurance here.

Further, the OnePlus 6 brings back OnePlus’ fast charging system. Regardless of what it’s called at this point, this system charges the phone up in what feels like a matter of minutes. Just plugging in for a short while can tremendously boost the available power, and I love that. It especially comes in handy since you’ll probably forget to the plug the phone in from time to time before going to bed. If only there was some wireless solution… Oh well.

SECURITY |

Biometric security is simply something we expect on a smartphone in 2018, and OnePlus is no exception. On the back of this device you’ll find a fingerprint sensor and, really, it’s as good as any other. As I mentioned earlier it’s a bit annoying that you can’t use it as a gesture pad like the Google Pixel or various other devices, but it’s still a good, quick sensor.

Nine times out of ten I have no issues signing into my phone with my fingerprint, and that even goes for when the device is in a case. I do wish the sensor’s physical size was just a little bit larger, but overall, there’s really not much to complain about here.

If a fingerprint sensor isn’t your cup of tea, though, there’s also Face Unlock. While this definitely isn’t the most secure facial recognition feature on a smartphone today, it works really well. Unlocking takes less time than blinking your eye, and even in challenging scenarios it still seems to almost always work. You’ll probably have some trouble in a dark room, but it’s still a great feature to have.

CAMERA |

OnePlus does an incredible job of making an affordable device feel like a top-of-the-line flagship, but the camera seems to be the common weak point. Things have been getting better and better over the years, but this is OnePlus’ best attempt yet to bring a flagship camera to a “cheap” phone.

Pictures taken on the 16MP rear camera of the OnePlus 6 are crisp, well-processed, and have great colors and dynamic range. Google’s Pixel 2 and Samsung’s Galaxy S9 both take better photos, there’s no doubt about that, but OnePlus has a seriously good contender here. I’ll let the pictures do the talking, though.

Aside from the picture quality itself, I also want to give OnePlus credit for its camera application. While it’s not as fully featured as some competitors, it’s extremely easy to use and it’s fast at the same time. Honestly, I don’t think you can ask for anything more from a camera app.

AUDIO |

Yes, the OnePlus 6 has a headphone jack. Yes, I’m glad it’s there. No, I haven’t used it even once since starting to use the phone.

What I have used a fair bit are the speakers, and they’re still a trainwreck if you ask me. The decision to stick with solely a bottom facing mono speaker is baffling when most of the industry has at least gone on to use the earpiece as a secondary speaker. In daily use I constantly find the speaker covered up and the audio nearly silenced. This is one of the biggest things I’d like to see fixed on the company’s next device.

FINAL THOUGHTS |

When it comes down to it, my thoughts on the OnePlus 6 are a lot of the same that everyone else has already said. This is the best phone you can get at this price point, and it makes one question if $900+ devices are actually worth the cost. If you’re looking to buy a new smartphone and the OnePlus 6 supports your network (because no, it still doesn’t work on Verizon), this needs to be one of the top contenders on your list. It’s the easiest smartphone recommendation I can give today.

Pricing starts at $529 and sales are available exclusively through OnePlus’ online store.

The entity-level investment is a rare deal in the Indian real estate market. A lot of capital used to come at entity level in the hey-days of the real estate sector in India a decade ago. But the markets turned after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, prompting most investors to start putting money at the project level to minimise risk.

The statement said that HomeKraft will invest over $300 million (Rs 2,000 crore) for development of affordable and mid-income housing projects across India. The investment will come from a mix of internal accruals, debt and private equity funds.

The development comes just two months after VCCircle reported that ATS, led by chairman and managing director Getamber Anand, was planning to raise funds at the entity-level by selling a significant minority stake.

“The affordable housing segment is expected to see healthy growth going forward given the impetus provided by the government through various incentives and subvention scheme,” said Renu Sud Karnad, managing director at HDFC Ltd. She added that HDFC’s funding will provide flexible financing to HomeKraft to meet its capital requirements and address the demand-supply gap in affordable housing in India.

HDFC Capital Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of HDFC Ltd, India’s biggest mortgage lender.

In December last year, HDFC Capital Advisors had raised $550 million for f its second affordable housing fund, the HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund–2 (H-CARE-2). This was combined with the firm’s first affordable housing fund, raised in 2016, to create a $1 billion platform targeting low- and mid-income residential projects in India’s top 15 cities.

The primary objective of the platform is to provide long term, equity and mezzanine capital to marquee developers at the land and pre-approval stage for the development of affordable and mid-income housing in India.

The fund recently collaborated with southern Indian developer Prestige Estates Projects to create a platform worth $390 million for low-cost housing.

HomeKraft is led by chief executive officer Prasoon Chauhan, a banking veteran with 12 years of real estate finance experience at private-sector lenders ICICI Bank and YES Bank.

HomeKraft is aiming to clock sales of 6,000-6,500 units in the next three to five years and revenue in the range of $600-750 million. The projects under the HomeKraft brand are in the range of Rs 30-70 lakh.

The company claimed it has sold more than 250 apartments in its first project—Happy Trails—in Noida in a single day. At the parent level, ATS has delivered about 30 million square feet of residential space and is construction 40 million square feet.","HomeKraft, the affordable and mid-income housing arm of Noida-based developer ATS Group, has sold a significant minority stake to HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund, a fund managed by HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, the company said in a statement.

Since you’re here, be sure to also check out our favorite nail polish shades for Summer 2018.



1. Lancôme Bi-Facil Double-Action Makeup Remover

I’ve been using this product for years and I’ve never found a reason to switch up my routine when it comes to eye makeup remover. Since both my eyeliner and mascara are waterproof, this item is heavy duty enough to remove both effortlessly, while still being gentle on the eyes (an area with notoriously delicate skin). The formula, however, is slightly oiler than milder options such as micellar water, so the composition might not be for everyone. If you’re looking for a remover that quite literally seems to wipe makeup right off though, this one is a sure-win. Despite being on the pricier side ($40 USD), a 200ml bottle lasts for months and is a worthwhile investment.

2. Shiseido Benefiance Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam

The name says it all. This cleanser is extremely creamy and easily works into a lush lather the more you work it into your face. Within the formula are tiny exfoliating beads that gently help to remove impurities on the skin’s surface. My face always feel fresh and moisturized after each use, leaving me with a feeling of a deep cleanse. Each tube retails at $36 USD.

3. Dior Hydra Life 2 in 1 Sorbet Water

Introduced just in time for summer, Dior’s new Hydra Life line truly does reflect its namesake title. All of the products are deeply hydrating and effortlessly quenches any dryness in your skin. For those who are familiar with Hong Kong, they’ll know that the summer season means air conditioners turned up to 11, which in turn inevitably means dried out skin. To re-hydrate my complexion, I rely on this Sorbet Water (approximately $50 USD) – the formula leaves my skin nice and plump, completely prepped for my nighttime routine.

4. Origins Plantscription Anti-Aging Power Serum

This serum has been described as “youth in a bottle” and while I do think it’s a great product, I wouldn’t really go that far. I first decided to try this product because it’s both paraben- and cruelty-free. I do find that my skin is more plump after each use, and also noticed that the smaller pores on my cheeks have been slightly reduced. Due to its high price point ($77 USD), I’m not sure I would replenish my stock after I finish up this bottle but for those who are looking to try a new eco-friendly product, this is a solid option.

5. Dior Hydra Life Sorbet Eye Gel

I’m a very big fan of this product. Each tube comes with a ceramic applicator that amplifies the cooling sensation that is already an effect from the gel itself. The result is an icy sensation that immediately revitalizes your eyes (the gel is great for your brows or temples too, though). Reducing any puffiness, this product has become an unmovable mainstay in my skincare routine. Each tube retails for approximately $55 USD.

6. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer

I first tried this product, not really expecting much, but I surprisingly loved it. The formula is very thick and rich (perfect for a night cream), and left my skin feeling baby soft in the morning. This moisturizer is technically meant for anti-aging purposes, which makes sense since my skin felt much more elastic after several uses. Retailing at $10.49 USD, you can’t go wrong with this.

1. Dior Triple Impact Makeup Remover

I’ve been using makeup wipes forever out of pure laziness, but once I tried out Dior’s Triple Impact Makeup Remover I realized what a difference it made for my skin. Leaving a moisturized finish and a clean canvas, this makeup remover manages to effectively remove my mascara as well as any other product I may be wearing. At $33 USD, it is pricey but definitely worth it.

2. Dermaceutic Foamer 5 Face Wash

Ever since I first started visiting my dermatologist, she’s recommended products that are tailored to my combination skin. This Foamer 5 face wash from Dermaceutic (approximately $48 USD) is slightly exfoliating, and removes any impurities and purifies the skin, and it truly does wonders for my complexion. I’ve been using this product for more than two years now, and I’m not planning on stopping anytime soon.

3. Biotherm Blue Therapy Serum-in-Oil

Although my skin feels really oily at times, I’ve learned that adding more oil isn’t actually a bad thing. After using Biotherm’s Blue Therapy Serum-in-Oil, I realized that my skin had a new glow, and a soft finish because of this hydrating serum. At $76 USD, it is incredibly pricey, but a little goes a long way and will definitely do wonders for your skin.

4. Dermaceutic Light Ceutic Night Moisturizer

To complement my face wash, I use Light Ceutic from Dermaceutic – a skin-toning night cream that I’ve been using for more than a year. Featuring a combination of glycolic acid, phytic acid and vitamin C, this night cream adds a very necessary boost to my face after a long day of staring at a computer screen. At approximately $45 USD, this product is more than worth it to me.

5. Estée Lauder Resilience Lift Firming/Sculpting Eye Creme

I’m someone with naturally dark under eyes, which not even an immense amount of concealer can cover up on some days. I’ve never been one for eye creams, but ever since I tried out Estée Lauder’s product, I’ve been hooked. Not only is it cooling and provides a hydrating feeling, it brightens my dark areas better than anything I’ve tried before. $65 USD may seem steep for an eye cream, but a little goes a long way with this one and you’ll be able to use it for a long time.

6. Kiehl’s #1 Lipbalm

To finish off my routine, I add a coat of lip balm to my lips, especially if I’ve been wearing lipstick during the day. Kiehl’s #1 Lipbalm is the only product I feel truly works for my lips, and leaves a light finish that gives a moisturized feeling. Retailing at only $9.50 USD, this miracle product is one that I would never leave out of my nightly roundup.

1. Shu Uemura Anti-Oxi+ Skin Refining Cleansing Oil

I’ve only started triple-cleansing recently (huge regrets) as I’m trying to do everything I can to prevent signs of aging. My younger self was definitely too lazy for that. To remove my makeup, I like to use this cult-favorite cleansing oil from Shu Uemura. Arguably one of the best makeup removers out there, this product is very gentle to the skin and does a great job in getting rid of any micro impurities and even the most stubborn eyeliners. I got my 450ml bottle for $82 USD which isn’t particularly the most budget-friendly, but honestly this is going to last you a really long time.

2. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser

Moving on to cleanser number two, the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser. Another product that’s been popular among skincare lovers, this facial cleanser does literally what it’s supposed to do — to cleanse thoroughly without leaving your skin feeling dried. For me, using a second cleanser is important as makeup residue is often invisible to the eyes (but it’s still there!) So, do give this $20 USD product a go if you’re serious about your cleansing routine.

3. (MALIN+GOETZ) Jojoba Exfoliating Cleanser

On days when I do wear makeup, I love to finish off by using (MALIN+GOETZ)’s Jojoba Exfoliating Cleanser (priced at $40 USD). I’ve read somewhere that exfoliating is key when it comes to minimizing the look of neck lines. As someone who uses bronzer on both the face and the neck almost all the time, I do find it necessary to use a face scrub regularly to keep my skin fresh and baby soft.

4. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Toner

Toner is one of those skincare products that some may find redundant. I had done without it for a short while and found that my skin felt significantly dehydrated, and since then I’m never not using a toner. My go-to is Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Toner ($16 USD). Again, this is one of the brand’s best-selling products and for good reason. It really helps prep and refine the texture of your skin so that it can better absorb any cream that you’re going to apply afterwards.

5. Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate

It’s been a little over a year since I introduced a serum to my evening skincare routine, and boy does that make a major difference. I was told that moisturizers are only able to replenish the surface layer of your skin. To hydrate what’s underneath that, you’ll need to rely on a serum like Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate. Trust me, you’ll be happy with the results after using this $47 USD product.

6. Kiehl’s Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado

Eye cream is another step that I abandoned for a while before I realized that it was a mistake. I’m someone who has always had dark circles around my eyes, so I do have to give this area some love and attention. By now, you’ll probably realize that my nighttime routine is made up almost entirely of Kiehl’s products, so it comes as no surprise that I count the brand’s Creamy Eye Treatment ($29 USD) as a favorite.

7. Aesop Camellia Nut Facial Hydrating Cream

Aesop has always been my top choice when it comes to night cream. I love trying different products from its offering and the latest I’ve been using is the Camellia Nut Facial Hydrating Cream ($49 USD). The luxurious cream features a mix of nut and plant extracts that not only provides anti-oxidant protection but also deeply hydrates skin.

8. Lush Dream Cream

I made a beauty resolution in the beginning of the year to use a body lotion daily, and I’m proud to say that I’ve been keeping my word. These days, I’ve been using Lush’s Dream Cream which is an ideal product even for those who have sensitive skin. Packed with nourishing ingredients like oat milk, lavender and cocoa butter, this $29.95 USD cream is effective in making every inch of your skin as smooth as ever.



1. Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser

I’ve sworn by this facial cleanser ever since I remember my mom’s dermatologist recommending it years ago. It gets the majority of my makeup off if I have on a full face or dramatic beat for a night out. What I love the most about this product is how refreshed my skin feels after I use it when I get home after a long day. To be quite honest, I’ve tried out numerous facial cleansers and this is extremely effective for my T-zone which is oily during the warmer months of the year. I would venture to say I’ve used this product for at least seven years. It’s efficient, moderately priced at $16 USD for 16 fluid ounces. Most importantly, the cleanser doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry which is an issue I’ve found with other cleansers.

2. Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner

If I can’t get all my makeup off, I use this toner which is a bit strong but gets the job done. When applied with a cotton ball, the product completely takes off left over eyeshadow and liquid foundation (I typically wear both daily.) In the past I was scared of using toners because I once used witch hazel which was too strong for my skin type. But when I added this product to my makeup routine if I had a lot of product on, I found that it didn’t dry my skin out like witch hazel did. After using this product a few times, I noticed that my skin was brighter. It’s affordable at $9 USD and worth trying out if you’re iffy on trying out alcohol-based toners.



1. Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser

I’m one of those people who’s always flitted between cleansers and never really stayed loyal to one brand or product. I guess I was just constantly on the quest for something that really got rid of all my makeup and didn’t dry out my sensitive skin. From the first time I tried Glossier’s cult-favorite Milky Jelly Cleanser ($18 USD), I was hooked. The light, creamy formula visibly dissolved my makeup and didn’t leave my skin feeling tight afterwards. I’ll never need to hunt for the perfect cleanser again.

2. Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Serum

Serums are a relatively new addition to the routine for me. I’d never paid them much attention but am always one to jump on the bandwagon, so when I saw talk of magical, face-altering serums flooding beauty industry, I had to give them a go. So far, the Rose Deep Hydration Serum by Fresh has been my favorite. The super fast-absorbing formula sinks right into my skin after cleansing and leaves my face feeling – and looking – ultra hydrated. At $48 USD, it is a little bit costly, but my smooth skin thanks me for it.

3. Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Cream

Since I’m a sucker for matching my products as much as I can, investing in Fresh’s Rose Deep Hydration Cream ($40 USD) was a no-brainer after the success of the serum. I usually apply this just before I go to bed, as a little treat at the end of the day. The lightweight, hybrid gel-cream formula is like a much-needed drink for my skin, which still feels ultra-soft the next day as a result. It’s infused with soothing rosewater and rose flower oil, which gives it a dreamy and subtle rosy scent – it’s definitely earned its spot as my favorite moisturizer of the moment.

4. Glossier Coconut Balm Dotcom

The final step in my nighttime routine is always a little lip balm and yes, I am that person who has multiple lip balms in every bag – and is somehow still losing them. Since Glossier launched in the U.K., I went crazy and bought literally every Balm Dotcom on offer. My go-to choice for the evening is the Coconut flavor and the nourishing formula glides right on with ease. It’s infused with antioxidants and provides long-lasting hydration through the night – and of course, the coconut scent is delicious. I usually add a swipe in the morning too, for a natural, dewy sheen – at just $12 USD each, you can afford to stock up on these.

5. The Body Shop Japanese Matcha Tea Pollution Clearing Mask

This face mask is an added bonus beauty product that I try to use weekly – usually on a Sunday night – to get my week off to a nice, wholesome start. Those who live in cities like London can attest to the fact that the polluted air does some really nasty things to your skin and although long-term damage is probably unavoidable on the whole, this $28 USD mask does a great job of helping my skin in the meantime. The smooth and soothing formula is enriched with Japanese matcha tea and Mexican aloe vera and genuinely removes impurities and pollutants from your skin. Just layer it on, let the tingling commence, leave it on for around 25 minutes and then wash off with warm water. The real trick comes when removing the mask – be sure to take it off with soft circular motions for a little extra exfoliation.



1. IOPE IDEAL Cleansing Milk

Going into summer, I choose to wear less makeup. Coverage turns lightweight and save a little Boy Brow and blush or contour, you could convince me to do little else. With that, I can do with a gentle makeup remover. IOPE’s IDEAL Cleansing Milk ($22 USD) is ultra-moisturizing, removing makeup traces while boosting the skin’s ability to retain moisture. It means I can really cleanse without drying out my skin.

2. IOPE IDEAL Cleansing Foam

Following the cleansing milk and while still in the shower, I proceed to use another cleanser. The milk removes makeup and debris, but its IOPE IDEAL Cleansing Foam ($20 USD) gives a deeper clean. The solution includes prebiotics, ceramide and hyaluronic acid. It is important to note that the two-step cleanse still leaves the skin plump, and ready to be primed with the next steps.

3. IOPE Hyaluronic Serum

Now onto the next step you will have noticed that I’ve stuck to the same brand. It’s something new I’m trying. IOPE’s Hyaluronic Serum ($45 USD) contains micro hyaluronic acid, inside hyaluronic capsules in its solution that also includes white birch juice. Everything together is designed to spread, and penetrate the skin with moisture, restoring what was lost during the cleanse. I can’t use toner which causes me to breakout, so it’s important to have a base hydration layer.

4. IOPE Hyaluronic Emulsion

Second to last is IOPE’s Hyaluronic Emulsion ($32 USD). It is also meant to hydrate like the last, but serum is considered to be lighter, and more concentrated. Emulsion is a lightweight lotion that works with skin’s natural oils to promote hydration. I have notoriously dry skin so the more hydrating, the better.

5. Atomy Nutrition Cream

The last step is a thicker moisturizer. Notice it isn’t IOPE but Atomy’s Nutrition Cream ($21 USD) isn’t one I can do without. I’ve religiously sworn by it the last three years and when it runs out or I haven’t ordered a replacement in time, I instantly notice dried out skin. The cream contains enriched amino acids made using advanced technology at Korea’s Atomic Energy Research Institute. It’s the best kept secret.



1. Garnier SkinActive All-In-1 Micellar Water

It took me a while to figure out the best way to remove my makeup. The idea of double cleansing makes me tired so Garnier’s SkinActive Micellar Water was the perfect solution. I soak a cotton pad with the formula and it wipes off everything from the day, even mascara. What more can you ask for from a $9 USD product?

2. Clean & Clear Night Relaxing Deep Clean Face Wash

I’m not picky about what I use to wash my face. Clean & Clear’s Night Relaxing Face Wash ($6 USD) suds up and makes my skin feel squeaky clean afterwards. I stay away from facial brushes (as per my esthetician’s instructions) so using this product helps remove any leftover makeup and grime with just circular motions of my hands.

3. Pixi Beauty Glow Tonic Exfoliating Toner

The main event for my night time skincare routine comes after I get out of the shower. I let my skin slightly dry then apply Pixi Beauty’s Glow Tonic ($30 USD). This item is a cult-favorite for a reason. Glycolic acid helps reveal a fresh layer of skin and the aloe vera soothes the peeling process. I highly recommend chemical exfoliants as opposed to physical scrubs.

4. Son & Park Beauty Water

Son & Park’s Beauty Water ($30 USD) is the newest product in my regimen. I picked it up with the hopes of smoothing out my skin and it more than delivered. After washing and applying my exfoliating toner, this gives my skin a boost of nutrients that penetrates deeply while I sleep.

5. The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA

The summer is quickly approaching and I’d rather not apply my normal two pumps of foundation a day. The Ordinary’s Alpha Arbutin ($9 USD) solution contains hyaluronic acid which holds 1,000 times its weight in water. This mixture helps tackle hyper pigmentation and scarring for a more even tone. With each application, I’m one step closer to achieving a flawless “no makeup” makeup look.

6. Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream

After putting on three layers of products, it’s important to lock it in place for the night. Aveeno’s Absolutely Ageless Restorative night cream ($17 USD) provides a moisturizing finish to my nighttime routine. Though I am still young it is never too early to prevent wrinkles and further help your skin out as it repairs while you sleep.","Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face MoisturizerI first tried this product, not really expecting much, but I surprisingly loved it.
I’ve never been one for eye creams, but ever since I tried out Estée Lauder’s product, I’ve been hooked.
So, do give this $20 USD product a go if you’re serious about your cleansing routine.

But with private property prices being what they are, affordability might be an issue for some. In fact, prices are on the upswing – the URA reported a 3.1 per cent rise in the first quarter of 2018, the highest quarterly price gain in eight years.

Here we look at some of the most attractively priced condos currently available on the market, culled from listings on this site.

The properties all have freehold tenure and are located within 1km of an MRT station. That translates to a roughly 10-to-15-minute walk at normal walking speed, or 1,300 steps if you are a Fitbit fanatic. For those who do not drive, that is a plus, whether the intention is to rent out or live in the unit.

The freehold condos are divided into three geographic areas – Core Central Region (CCR), Rest of Central Region (RCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR).

1) CCR

Singapore’s CCR includes the prime districts of 9, 10 and 11; the downtown core (which encompasses the CBD, Civic District and Marina Bay); and Sentosa Island.

As these areas house some of the most desirable real estate on the island, prices tend to be on the high side. From January to May 2018, the median psf ranged from $2,000 to $2,100, according to analysis on this site.

But the CCR remains the most popular region for expats. And there are affordable options if you know where to look.

In the Novena area (District 11), a one-bedroom unit at Suites @ Shrewsbury can be had for $680,000. The development is 800m from Novena station (NS20). Directly above and around the station are numerous shopping malls such as Novena Square, United Square and Velocity. Tan Tock Seng Hospital is also a stone’s throw away.

Also in District 11 is Dunearn Suites, where a one-bedroom apartment has an asking price of $800,000. Only 500m from Tan Kah Kee (DT8) and 700m from Botanic Gardens (CC19), the property is conveniently located near an NTUC Fairprice supermarket, the Adam Road Food Centre, plus numerous cafes and restaurants.

Story continues

Finally, over in District 9, we find Mackenzie 88, a boutique development behind Mount Sophia. There, a one-bedroom unit ranges from $760,000 to $888,000. Little India (NE7, DT12) is but 350m, or a five-minute stroll, away. The vibrant ethnic enclave of Little India has no shortage of dining options, while the FairPrice Xpress in Peace Centre can be reached on foot in 10 minutes.

2) RCR

The RCR extends from Paya Lebar in the east to Bishan in the north and Pasir Panjang in the west.

Our focus, however, is on Little India and the adjacent Balestier/Bendemeer areas. Known as District 8, the neighbourhood has welcomed a great many new developments in recent years, including a few freehold condos. The average psf here ranges from $1,200 to $1,500.

Just off Race Course Road is Loft @ Rangoon and City Loft, which are both served by Farrer Park (NE8). They are each about 300m away, or a four-minute walk, from the station. The five-year-old Loft @ Rangoon has one-bedroom apartments going for between $750,000 and $850,000. Meanwhile, six-year-old City Loft boasts studios at around the $650,000 to $700,000 mark.

Nearby are Cavan Suites and Tyrwhitt 139, both about 500m away from Bendemeer (DT23). Studios at Cavan Suites hover around the $620,000 mark, while at Tyrwhitt 139 the asking price is between $628,000 and $645,000. They benefit not only from the abundance of F&B outlets in the vicinity, but also from the proximity to the CBD. It takes only about 12 minutes to get from Bendemeer to Downtown (DT17).

3) OCR

The OCR covers all other areas of Singapore that are not part of the CCR or RCR. Major hubs like Tampines and Jurong are in this zone, but we shall zoom in on Upper Bukit Timah (District 21).

This is a pleasant residential neighbourhood comprising mostly landed homes and some condominiums. It also has easy access to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. The area is served by Beauty World (DT5), with the median psf hovering around $1,200.

At Suites at Bukit Timah, a studio apartment goes for just over $600,000. This freehold condo is a mere 400m or six-minute walk from the MRT. A little further away – 900m – is the one-year-old The Creek @ Bukit, where several one-bedroom units are asking for anywhere between $840,000 and $890,000. These prices are one- to six-per cent below valuation.

Over at NottingHill Suites – a 1km walk from the MRT – there are also some studio units priced below valuation. In terms of absolute cost, the figures range from $650,000 to $1.2 million, depending on the configuration.

92,https://news.mit.edu/2018/student-profile-xingang-zhao-0711,"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",MIT News,Making nuclear energy safer and more affordable,"In March 2011, as the disastrous accidents were unfolding at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, Xingang Zhao was contemplating his next steps after completing a combined bachelor’s/master’s degree in energy and environmental engineering at the National Institute of Applied Sciences in Lyon, France.

The Nanjing, China, native had moved to France to study engineering with a focus on climate change. There, he zeroed in on low-carbon energy systems, driven by his interest in their global technological, economic, and social impacts. He learned that nuclear energy supplied a significant proportion of France’s electricity, and he became captivated by the sheer power generation at nuclear power plants.

“I was really passionate about the complexity of the nuclear systems. I couldn’t imagine how you could generate such a huge amount of power out of [a small reactor],” Zhao says. “[Nuclear energy] is really amazing, and it’s clean energy. In a low-carbon world, it should be a really useful energy source.”

But he wasn’t committed to pursuing graduate studies in nuclear engineering until the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disasters.

“I realized how important safety was not only for nuclear [systems], but also for human beings. Ten days after that disaster happened, I submitted my application” to a nuclear engineering program, Zhao recalls. “I said to myself, ‘Why don’t you study nuclear and try to make a contribution, to make nuclear reactors safer, to try to mitigate people’s concerns or fears?’”

Zhao went on to study nuclear engineering at the National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology in France, where he tuned into the details of nuclear technology and the societal implications of nuclear energy development.

Now, Zhao is a fourth-year graduate student in MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, and he is on a quest to revamp nuclear energy safety measures to make nuclear technologies safer and more efficient.

Reassessing limits

During his early graduate studies at MIT, Zhao spent his summers interning at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. There, he was invited to work on modeling and simulating the flow physics and heat transfer of nuclear reactors for applications in safe operating guidelines, through the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s first innovation hub bridging basic research, engineering, and industry.

Zhao’s research is aimed at preventing a boiling crisis — an accident scenario in which nuclear fuel rods can no longer be effectively cooled during the heavy heat-producing energy generation process. Boiling crises can result in “a set of cascading failures,” and Zhao hopes his model will improve the methods used to predict them. “As engineers, we’re here to make sure this will never happen,” Zhao says.

However, he says, pressurized water reactors, which generate the majority of the electricity derived from nuclear power worldwide, are operating at parameters that are too conservative, compromising efficiency and energy output.

Currently, commercial nuclear reactors are required to operate at lower than three-fourths of their critical heat flux — the threshold at which a boiling crisis is triggered. “In nuclear, we like everything as conservative as possible,” Zhao says. But that cautious approach could come with a hidden cost: inefficiency. Zhao suspects that under some scenarios traditional models that calculate critical heat flux place it too low, meaning that the current nuclear reactor fleets are operating well under capacity.

To find out just how low, Zhao refers to the principles of physics.

“At the end of the day, nuclear engineering is all about physics,” Zhao says. By developing a physics-based approach that models how coolant flows around fuel rods, and validating it with recent experimental data, Zhao hopes to capture the true value of the critical heat fluxes for different reactors and allow them to operate more efficiently.

“In turn, that would have a positive impact for the profitability of your nuclear reactor, because that would enable you to provide more energy,” Zhao says. “Being able to provide more power without compromising safety and increasing costs makes nuclear energy more competitive.”

Impactful interactions

During his studies, Zhao took 22.312 (Engineering of Nuclear Reactors) and now considers it his favorite course at MIT. The course, taught by Jacopo Buongiorno, the TEPCO Professor and associate department head in nuclear science and engineering, covers the principles of nuclear reactor design, with a focus on the generation and removal of heat.

“Instead of showing slides, he put everything on the board, and made complicated subjects and concepts easily approachable,” Zhao says. Inspired by Buongiorno’s approach, Zhao aims to make his own research accessible for nonspecialists and easily applicable for the nuclear industry.

While 22.312 was required for Zhao’s field of study at MIT, he continued to take elective classes, even as recently as his fourth year. “For me, it’s not a burden,” Zhao says. “It’s more like, I learn things every day.”

Zhao credits his thesis advisor, Koroush Shirvan, assistant professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and MIT education program lead for CASL, with providing him with the mentorship necessary to pursue ambitious, computationally intensive doctoral research and classwork.

He and Shirvan regularly discuss challenges in not only research, but also daily life. “What makes him so great as a mentor, is that he’s smart himself and really cares about his students. But to me, he is more than that: He’s like a big brother to me,” Zhao says.

“I feel like MIT is more than an Institute. It’s like a family,” Zhao says. “And I really want to contribute to making this world a better place, by either working in academia or in a research-oriented laboratory or company. No matter where I would be, my intrinsic motivation will stay the same.”

In the long-term, Zhao hopes to make an impact on the international nuclear community.

“I think that in a new nuclear world, people from different countries have to collaborate more,” Zhao says. “We need to work together as a team and make nuclear energy safer and more affordable.”","He learned that nuclear energy supplied a significant proportion of France’s electricity, and he became captivated by the sheer power generation at nuclear power plants.

The lack of clear electric vehicle (EV) maintenance information is confusing for new drivers. Many people understand that EVs requires little to no maintenance, but this is certainly not something the majority of the population understands. Early EV drivers have stories of only changing brake pads and windshield wipers in the first 70,000 miles, but how many people looked for a used car have heard such stories?

Carmakers don’t like to talk much about EV maintenance since, technically, there is often no reason for any in the first 100,000 miles. That’s not to say there are no costs, though. Understandably, Tesla decided to charge for yearly check-ups to check out its new package of technology in the automotive world. Today, all EVs come with some form of the maintenance schedule.

So, when FleetNews reported that the Citroen C-Zero is “the cheapest used electric vehicle to run,” we felt that was something the company would want to brag about. After all, who wouldn’t want to sell a car with little to no maintenance?

HPI is the organization that named the Citroen C-Zero the most affordable used electric vehicle to run (in the UK), but not only — the examination also included hybrids on Britain’s roads. In total, HPI noted that electric cars and hybrids more than doubled last year from 20,522 to 45,236.

The analysis of lowest running costs includes monthly running costs, cost per mile, service and maintenance, depreciation, and insurance to calculate a total cost of motoring. HPI found the Citroen C-Zero came out on top at £410 monthly, followed by the Peugeot iOn hatchback at £413 and the Volkswagen e-Up at £526.

Although the Citroen C-Zero is an old car, the new electric Mehari could be just what the doctor ordered — a seriously fun EV.

Ultimately, until carmakers find a new business model to make EVs, we’ll have to look for more affordable EVs like the Citroen C-Zero.

“More affordable, accessible housing is needed in all corners of the province,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, in a press release. “Seniors and people with disabilities can now live without worrying about what barriers might exist in their housing and, as part of our commitment to climate action, we’re identifying ways to make sure more homes like these are energy efficient.”

Located at 3787 Sixteenth Avenue, Harding Heights is open and targeting Passive House certification. Passive House standards aim to minimize the energy used for heating and cooling. The housing incorporates design features and technologies that reduce energy use and utility costs for residents and the operator, and improve the comfort and air quality for those living in the building.

“By designing these homes to meet Passive House standards, we are providing shelter for British Columbians in a sustainable way, while providing more comfortable and affordable housing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in a press release. “Encouraging more efficient housing is essential to building a clean-growth economy in B.C.”

Harding Heights’ building standards achieve the highest level of the BC Energy Step Code. This is in line with the Province’s goal of going above and beyond the requirements of the BC Building Code in energy-efficiency, moving toward being net-zero energy ready in new construction by 2032.

“The Town of Smithers congratulates BC Housing and the Dik Tiy Housing Society on the completion of their successful project,” said Smithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach in the release. “Not only does the new building add to the diversity and affordability of housing in Smithers, it also demonstrates climate-action leadership as Smithers’ first certified Passive House project. Thank you to BC Housing for this significant investment in our community.”

Dik Tiy will operate and manage the project, while High Road Services Society will provide support services to people living with disabilities.

“With the development of this amazing passive housing project, and the hard work of BC Housing, our society and our community, we are excited to see lives changed, blessed, enhanced and improved because of the creation of this community within a community,” said Dana Gorbahn, executive director of Dik Tiy Housing Society.

High Road Services Society’s support services will involve working with individuals on a range of self-care and life skills that will assist them in achieving maximum independence.

The Government of British Columbia provided an investment of approximately $3.4 million in capital funding.

Rental rates for the new development are $375 to $500 for bachelor units, $550 to $625 for one-bedroom units.","Seniors and people with disabilities in Smithers now have access to new affordable and accessible rental homes, as a result of a partnership between the Province, the Town of Smithers and the Dik Tiy Housing Society.

There’s no shortage of options that deliver excellent sound quality, but some of them are big, bulky, and expensive. Polk Audio is a renowned audio brand, and the company has recently debuted its first Assistant speaker, and it delivers a whole lot for its small size and affordable price…

SOUND QUALITY |

The biggest selling point of the Polk Assist by far is its audio quality, so let’s start off by talking about that. Put simply, it’s absolutely fantastic. Polk is well-known for putting out products with killer audio quality, and this smart speaker is no exception.

Polk has designed this speaker with a 3.5-inch mid/woofer at the core, and a 1-inch tweeter up above. Together, this setup produces some great sound, especially considering the footprint. For obvious reasons, you shouldn’t expect this to beat out something like the Home Max or HomePod, but it’s definitely the best smart speaker I’ve heard at this size. I wouldn’t go as far as to say this is well ahead of competing options at this general size, but there’s a clear difference to my ears.

Given the size, the best comparison is to the standard, original Google Home. While Google’s option has stronger bass, Polk Assist has cleaner quality, bass that doesn’t overpower the mids and highs, and it’s also notably louder at its highest volumes. Regardless of the genre, you’ll find yourself enjoying the audio from this speaker for sure.

My sole complaint when it comes to the audio is that it’s very directional. You’ll definitely be able to hear this speaker anywhere in a large room, but if you’re not on the same side as the actual drivers, there’s a notable drop off in volume and quality.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT |

Outside of the sound quality, Assistant is the biggest selling point here. Polk has already brought a unique Alexa-enabled soundbar to the market, but the Assist is its first proper smart speaker, and it opted for Google Assistant.

As usual with Assistant integration, you’re getting just about everything from a typical Google Home. You can ask questions, assign tasks such as timers, set reminders, and more. The Assist even supports recently added features such as Continued Conversation. That, of course, includes integration with popular music services such as Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, and more. These all work brilliantly on the device as well.

However, like most other third-party Assistant speakers, there are some limitations. Most notably, this includes the lack of support for calling which is a real shame.

Finally, there are the microphones. This is a key part of any smart speaker, and some certainly fall short. Luckily, the Polk Assist isn’t one of them. This speaker picks up my voice just about every time, with a success rate pretty close to the standard Google Home or Home Max in my experience. The one note I do have, though, is that you’ll need to keep the top of the device clean to avoid the mics being blocked by dust build-up.

As for performance while music is playing, though, things are a bit more hit or miss. Sometimes the speaker picks up “Hey Google” commands without skipping a beat, but other times the beat blocks it from hearing you at all. It’s a common problem with these speakers, and really only the Home Max has seemed to figure it out.

HARDWARE |

Polk has a very signature design language, and it’s here on the Assist as well. The majority of the speaker is covered in a fabric material which, on my unit, comes in a subtle grey color. That’s accented by black plastic portions on the top and bottom. It’s a good look overall, but it definitely doesn’t stand out or demand attention (not that that’s a bad thing).

Build quality is great here as well. The materials don’t feel cheap by any means, and the device has a notable heft that you don’t find on Google Home.

Up top, the Polk Assist also has a selection of physical buttons. These include a play/pause button, Assistant button, and volume controls. In the center of these buttons, there’s a smaller cluster of LEDs which indicate when the device is listening, as well as volume. There’s also a mute switch on the back side of the device, just like on the standard Google Home.

One annoying little tidbit I’ve got to mention, though, is the size of the power brick. It’s unnecessarily massive if you ask me, meaning you can’t plug it into a power strip easily or even a wall outlet.

FINAL THOUGHTS & WHERE TO BUY |

Smart speakers are becoming more and more prevalent, and options are becoming available for everyone to fit their exact needs. In the case of the Polk Assist, I think the best use case here is someone who wants the same form factor as the standard Google Home, but simply wants improved audio without forking over $399 for a Home Max. For $199, it’s a really good option for that.

Polk sells the Assist in “Midnight Black” and “Cool Gray” for $199. You can pick it up directly from the company’s website, as well as B&H Photo.

The company, which currently has about 8 million square feet of project pipeline, looks to capitalise on the tax incentives provided for the affordable housing sector. The Centre's affordable housing push provides income-tax benefit for corporate under section 80IBA of the I-T Act.

To be located at the Arvind Smart City in Naroda area of Ahmedabad, the new scheme will have 1,200 units of 2-BHK category having a carpet area of 500-650 sq ft with prices ranging between Rs 20-35 lakh without taxes.

""There are encouraging tax incentives on profits earned from the affordable housing schemes. We are bullish on this segment for strong growth as we were not present in the category,"" Kamal Singal, MD & CEO, Arvind Smart Spaces Ltd told BusinessLine.

The scheme will be rolled-out in two phases, with the first phase of 600 units to be launched on Saturday and likely to be completed in 3.5-4 years.

Arvind Smart Spaces is also expanding its portfolio with a launch of Uplands - a scheme of high-end villas spread across 135 acres on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. The project is under development stage and the possession will start taking place between December 2018-March 2019. Besides this, the company has a plotting scheme near Sanand for 500 plots spread across 150 acres.

According to Singal, the company will look for growth from new segments and emerging markets. Its presence in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar is set to fuel the growth, while it also plans to expand to Pune soon.

The company already has 2.5 million sq ft of its 8 mn sq ft pipeline at Bengaluru, while 5.5 sqft is located in Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar. ""We are planning to enter Pune market for which initial agreements and documentations are underway. This will be a high-end apartment scheme in Pune,"" Singal said..

It has 3.5 million sq ft under luxury segment and 3.5 million sq ft under mid-segment, while one million sq ft under commercial segment.

Arvind Smart Spaces had posted a revenue of Rs 202 crore for the fiscal 2018 with a net profit of Rs 30 crore. EBITDA for the year stood at Rs 65 crore. While its revenues grew from Rs 87 crore in fiscal 2015 to Rs 202 crore in 2018, its profits nearly tripled from Rs 11 crore since fiscal 2015.

Notably, the company's EBITDA has been rising since fiscal 2015 every year from Rs 25 crore to Rs 37 crore in fiscal 2016 and Rs 46 crore in fiscal 2017.

100,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/canon-eos-m50-review-high-end-features-at-affordable-price-1287144-2018-07-16,"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",India Today,Canon EOS M50 review: High-end features at affordable price,"Canon needs no introduction. It is company that has given pro photographers and hobbyists a number of iconic cameras. It has, however, failed to crack the mirrorless camera code. A lot of this has to do with the competition. Brands like Sony, Panasonic and Fujifilm have some really good options in the mirrorless camera category, and so far Canon has not lived up to its high standards in this segment. With the EOS M50, the company aims to change that.

If you shifted through Canon's portfolio of mirrorless cameras, before the M50 there were three options: the entry-level EOS M100, the mid-tier EOS M6 and the top-end EOS M5. The EOS M50 launched by Canon recently is also a mid-tier camera. But only in price. It has features than more or less match, or in cases even surpass, everything that the flagship EOS M5 offers. The EOS M50 is high on specs and low in price, and that is what makes all the difference.

Design, build quality and controls

The EOS M50 borrows heavily from the EOS M5 as far as the core design is concerned. It uses considerable amount of polycarbonate in its construction with a faux leather handgrip. The build quality is solid, and the whole thing weighs in just over 380 gram -- slightly less than what the EOS M5 weighs -- and that results in a reassuring feel in the hands. You will feel the EOS M50 in your hands at all times, but not to an extent that it becomes tiring.

Much like the EOS M5, the EOS M50 also comes with a centrally positioned electronic viewfinder (EVF), something that's missing on the EOS M6, which is priced only a couple of thousands less.

The similarities with the flagship EOS M5, however, end there. While the EOS M5 is geared towards enthusiasts, the EOS M50 is a beginners-only affair. This is because unlike the EOS M5 that ships with a host of body-mounted controls, the EOS M50 has only a single mode dial on the top. It is even missing out on the dedicated exposure compensation dial seen on the more affordable EOS M6. While that's a good thing for beginners who would want to start shooting right off the bat, enthusiasts and pros looking for more control should look elsewhere.

The same is true about the controls on the rear of the camera. The EOS M50 comes with a four-way control pad and a couple of other dedicated controls, including one for auto focus, but it's sparse on direct controls. Of course, to access other settings you can always get into the menu either through the quick menu button or the touchscreen but doing that also means taking that extra bit to click the perfect photo.

IMAGE SAMPLES

Speaking of the screen, the EOS M50 has a vari-angle touchscreen display hinged at the side of the body. The display makes working at unusual angles easy, so you can shoot from down low or even hold the camera up high. Or, you can simply pull it outwards to face your subject. Touchscreen also helps in composing the photo because you can change and control a lot of settings, including shutter speed and aperture, on the display itself. It's also convenient to see the result of your changes in live view when you're shooting in manual.

The built-in electronic viewfinder boasts of a 2.36 million-dot resolution so what you see is what you get, mostly.

The EOS M50's pitch to attract beginners also extends to the camera's graphical user interface. The interface can explain the different settings to photographers, and also imagine the effect a specific adjustment will have on the final shot.

Performance

The EOS M50 sports a 24.1-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor. This sensor has a native ISO range of 100 to 25,600, which can be expanded to 51,200. Canon says that the EOS M50 uses the same sensor that is inside the more expensive EOS M5. The EOS M50, however, takes things a step further by featuring Canon's latest DIGIC 8 image processor. The new processor brings a host of capabilities to the EOS M50, including the ability to record 4K videos (up to 24fps) and 4K timelapse videos. The new processor also allows users to extract stills from 4K footage.

The biggest takeaway, however, lies in the fact that the new processor aids in bringing enhanced features to Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF system. The EOS M50 can, as a result, make use of a larger frame, 143 AF points and a feature called Eye AF, which can lock onto a subject's eyes, something that's quite handy while shooting a portrait.

Clearly, Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF system in the EOS M50 trumps the one on-board the EOS M5 in terms of raw specs. But what about real world performance? I am happy to report that it works quite well, even more so for its relatively low price. The EOS M50 is usually quick to lock on to focus but the key standout for me has been its touch and drag feature that, as the name suggests, lets you manually touch and drag the AF point with your finger on the rear touchscreen display even when you have the camera raised to your eye.

Also, you can choose not to use the entire screen and fill only half or a quarter of the display via the menu for the purpose. The range of options on offer here were previously limited to Canon's higher-end and more expensive cameras. The EOS M50 brings these features to a more mainstream audience which is nice.

The new DIGIC 8 image processor also assists in a more reliable AF tracking unless you're dealing with a very fast moving subject. In other words, it's good enough for kids, but not a bird in flight. The EOS M50 can lock on to your subject and also it can hold on to it, as long as you're dealing with a steady frame. The EOS M50 can shoot at up to 10fps in Single AF mode, and at up to 7.4fps in Continuous AF, which is a big step up from the EOS M5.

The electronic viewfinder is another positive highlight of the EOS M50. Its refresh rate and magnification work well while the touchscreen interface on the rear display is fast and responsive.

The built-in Image Stabilization (IS) system on the supplied 15-45mm lens works well in varying light scenarios although the camera is prone to shake -- sometimes even alarmingly -- owing to its f/6.3 maximum aperture (which is a stop slower than many rivals) in low light.

Connectivity options on the EOS M50 include Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy.

The EOS M50 may be high on features and connectivity options but not everything its hunky-dory. Once charged 100 per cent, the battery in the EOS M50 lasts around 220 to 230 shots, which is a little disappointing.

Picture quality

-- The 24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor inside the EOS M50 is promising, delivering clean and crisp photos especially in good lighting. What I really like about it is its versatility. It can be a beginner's aid as a handy point-and-shoot (auto) while it can also keep enthusiasts fairly well satisfied as a capable manual camera. If only it gave you a few more body-mounted direct controls.

-- The EOS M50 also puts in a solid performance when it comes to dynamic range, although there's some room for improvement when it comes to pure sharpness and resolving power. You will feel this especially when viewing your photos up close or in case you're looking to make larger prints.

-- Where it falters -- albeit slightly -- in sharpness and resolution, the EOS M50 more than compensates for with its impressive performance at higher ISO, which means the camera can deliver very good low-light performance with bare minimum noise.

-- The EOS M50 supports a new RAW file format, .CR3, which replaces .CR2 and brings with it a new C-RAW option. This feature lets you shoot full-resolution raw files while saving roughly 30-40 per cent of storage space over standard raw files with the trade-off being that C-RAW is a lossy compressed RAW file.

-- The EOS M50 can do 4K videos but there is 1.6X crop that is applied. This means your 4K videos won't be able to use the entire breadth of the sensor. It's nice for portraits, but not when you're shooting at arm's length. You will have to use a different lens if you're looking to make more out of your 4K videos, but sadly, Canon still has a limited number of lenses available to M series.

Should you buy it?

You can say that the Canon EOS M50 has better features than the high-end EOS M5. It has faster burst shooting, an improved Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, and 4K video recording. The vari-angle touchscreen display also offers more flexibility as compared to the EOS M5's tilt-angle mechanism. Also, its touchscreen interface is among the best in the market right now. The camera also delivers excellent results 8 out of 10 times which is what really matters at the end of the day when you're out buying a camera.

The relative dearth of body-mounted controls may irk more experienced photographers but I don't think that's where Canon is targeting with the EOS M50. With the EOS M50, Canon is looking to offer a more mainstream package for a more mainstream audience: an audience that is looking to switch from a point-and-shoot (or even a mobile camera) but isn't quite ready for a full-scale DSLR or even a high-end mirrorless camera with finer control like the EOS M5 that costs Rs 85,995. That the EOS M50 doesn't compromise on specs is just an icing on the cake.

The Canon EOS M50 is a very good mirrorless camera and its price of Rs 61,995 is good enough. Whether or not you should buy it, would depend on what you're looking to do with your camera. For pro or experienced photographers this is not the right camera, but if you click photos as a hobby the EOS M50 should be on your shortlist.","The EOS M50 is high on specs and low in price, and that is what makes all the difference.

That's how it feels for thousands of people with a complicated medical history or long-term health problem battling to get affordable travel insurance each year.

Chris Lewis, 62, a business consultant in London is a prime example, forced to forgo holidays with his family for years after his cancer treatment because, he says, insurers discriminated against him because of his health.

With one in two of us expected to be affected by cancer at some point in our lives by the year 2020, this issue is affecting more and more people.

We have put together a guide on where to look for insurance, what your options are and what you need to think about if you have, or have had a serious illness in the past.

Well-deserved break: Chris Lewis, 62, finally made it on holiday with his grandson after years of struggling to get cover after treatement

Chris, was diagnosed in 2007 with a stage 4 blood cancer. Since then he has been treated with chemotherapy and undergone a grueling stem cell transplant.

While he is thankfully still in remission, unfortunately having a transplant can have its own long-term complications and Chris still struggles with rejection issues.

He says: 'For a long time after my treatment I didn't want to travel as the problem of finding travel insurance was too much. So many companies wouldn't touch me and others wanted crazy money.

'Unfortunately, once you mention the word cancer, you are discriminated against by everyone! Banks, employers and insurers to name but a few.'

'With most things in life there is no one size fits all approach that will work. Not everyone affected by cancer is dying, but you tend to get treated the same.

'I have now been able to get affordable cover through a specialist insurer, InsuranceWith, which I found via social media.

'But the industry doesn’t seem to want to help everybody find cover, this is an industry fraught with customer confusion.'

For those like Chris affected by a serious illness, a holiday is more than just a summer break, it's often seen as a symbolic step in recovery or an aim to fix on during treatment – a dream they shouldn’t be forced to give up or risk financial difficulties to enjoy.

So here are our top tips to make sure you get the best and cheapest cover with a pre-existing illness such as cancer.

GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR QUESTIONS At This is Money we want to arm you with the tools you need to manage your money as easily as possible so you can focus your attention on your health and family. This is the fourth in our 'cancer and your finances' series which will look at how to claim on health insurance, workplace and Government benefits and extra financial help if you're ill among other things. If you have a subject you'd like us to include in the series, email emma.gunn@thisismoney.co.uk

How it works

Travel insurance premiums are calculated according to the risk that you will make a claim.

With a history of ill health the likelihood you will need to claim, or the costs of medical treatment are deemed higher.

If the costs are deemed too high by an insurer they will often turn people away or apply a higher premium or excess to claims.

The other alternative you might be offered is to exclude your pre-existing condition from your policy, meaning that any medical expenses or cancellations related to your illness won't be covered.

However with a pre-existing condition your top priorities for comprehensive cover will be cancellation cover in the lead up to your trip, medical expenses for treatment abroad, repatriation in an emergency and travel costs if medical treatment means you miss your return home.

Specialist insurers, which are often not widely known about, often offer more tailored quotes or work out premiums slightly differently, meaning more reasonable prices and better cover.

Where to look for specialist cover

Arguably the most important part of this guide - where you should look for cover.

Fiona Macrae from consumer awareness initiative travelinsuranceexplained.co.uk says: 'The key is to find a travel insurance company that will treat you as an individual and recognise no two people or the treatment they receive is the same.'

'Spend some time researching travel insurers. There are specialist providers who cover medical conditions and use a medication-led risk rating tool to fairly assess individual situations, these companies are often recommended on cancer charity forums. However, these companies are not on comparison sites so you would need to get a quote directly from their website.'

Richard Smith is managing director at tifgroup, which offers one of these medication-based medical risk rating tools, Protectif, used by specialist insurers.

He explains why a medication-led approach can lead to fairer prices: 'We know that some medical risk rating tools are unsophisticated. For example, those who are well and are living normally with cancer and other complex medical conditions can be charged the same as a person who has metastatic cancer with recent complications from the treatment and/or the disease.

'This is because other medical risk rating tools do not gather enough information about each person’s individual circumstances, so they are often charged based on a higher risk than is necessary for their personal needs.'

Looking specifically at the medication you take, rather than your list of conditions means insurers can better asses how stable your condition is, which can be a huge advantage to those who are well and living with cancer, or who have had treatment in the past.

The fact that they are not found on comparison sites means people are often unaware that specialist insurance companies exist and are a cheaper alternative to the more established and recognisable brands.

An FCA review recently highlighted this, and in a win for consumers, it will in future force insurers and comparison sites to flag to customers that they may be able to get a cheaper deal if they go to a specialist insurer that deals with pre-existing conditions.

In the mean time, it's worth asking when you visit the hospital if other patients recommend any particular company, or checking comment sections and online forums to read about other people’s experience with insurers.

Here are a few This is Money has come across which have received good reviews through word of mouth or from those with cancer in online forums - Boots, Insurancewith, Ok to Travel, AllClear, Worldfirst, Eurotunnel (Europe only), Nationwide FlexPlus current account insurance, AXA PPP healthcare.

You can also try Macmillan’s online community or Cancer Research’s list of specialist insurers.

Using BIBA's 'Find Insurance Service' may prove a useful starting point.

Special trip: Focusing on planning a holiday for the end of treatment can be the light at the end of the tunnel

WHAT INFORMATION YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET A QUOTE Gathering quotes can be time consuming, stressful, and rehashing all of your medical history repeatedly can be upsetting. There are often a lot of questions which require close detail so making sure you have all the info you need in one place to start with can be a big help. Here are the types of details you might need. Your details: Name, age, destination, who you are travelling with and how long for. About your health conditions: What health problems you have have, how long ago they were diagnosed, what stage it was and if it spread or is terminal, any surgery you have had or have planned, what medication you are on, any side effects medication causes, any other supportive therapies you are on at the hospital, any treatments planned for the future, you may also need to know any medical equipment to travel. Medical contacts: The hospitals and departments/specialists you are seen under or treated by, your GP's details, information about your most recent visits or investigations.

A word of warning - the cost of travel without insurance

In the face of high costs from the larger insurers and without knowing about a specialist insurance firm it's tempting to just say, let's risk it and travel without insurance or just not disclose your medical history when buying a policy.

But proper travel cover is essential for everyone, and if you don't inform your insurer about your history you won't be properly protected.

Andrew Johnson, advice manager at The Money Advice Service said: ‘Travel insurance is essential if you are travelling aboard, especially if you need to pay for medical expenses or in serious cases flown home.

‘When shopping around you could be subject to additional underwriting requirements. So it’s important to disclose everything including any changes in your condition from the point of booking, to going on holiday. Failure to do this could lead to your claim being turned down.’

Covering a pre-existing illness doesn't just mean you are covered if that illness gets worse abroad, it also affects cover for other related medical treatment abroad.

For example, if you get any sort of infection while abroad (one of the most likely risks after chemotherapy) you will only be covered if you have declared your cancer treatment as insurers will consider it related.

The cost to travellers of medical help abroad can be thousands, as the table below displays, showing the average claim values last year by customers of specialist insurer AllClear with the most common types of cancer.

AVERAGE CLAIMS FOR MOST COMMON CONDITIONS VS MOST COMMON CANCERS Condition declared Claim cost (average) Condition declared Claim cost (average) Ischaemic Heart disease £7,000 Breast cancer £6,800 Arrhythmia £6,000 Prostate cancer £10,800 Coronary angioplasty £6,000 Bowel cancer £7,500 Cholesterol levels £6,000 Basal cell carcinoma £7,100 High blood pressure £6,000 Bladder cancer £7,800 Asthma £6,000 Lymphoma £3,900 Diabetes mellitus £5,000 Malignant melanoma £16,400 Hypothyroidism £5,000 Lymphoma (low grade or grade unknown) £4,700 Back problems £5,000 Bowel cancer diagnosed more than five years ago £8,300 Osteoarthritis £4,000 Skin cancer £9,300 Source: AllClear

Watch out for package bank account cover

Package bank accounts often come with travel insurance attached.

If you have a pre-existing condition you need to be careful as these polices won’t automatically cover you.

Most banks will require that you speak to their insurance department to see if they will cover you for your condition, often they come with restrictions and age limits so they should be approached with caution.

But sometimes it costs less to add the extra cover for an premium compared to a separate policy with another insurer.

After cancer treatment or a serious illness you may struggle to get annual cover, with most companies only willing to take on the risk for single trips.

However policies through your bank account often have the benefit of year-long multi-trip cover.

Some package accounts including those from Bank of Scotland and Lloyds give you a medical screening automatically when you sign up, others such as Barclays and Halifax stipulate that if you have a medical condition you must inform them to organise for a screening.

You may also be required to call up every time you book a trip, such as with First Direct and Natwest.

Paris vs St Lucia: The Caribbean is one of the most expensive places to receive medical care so travel insurance costs are much higher

Choose your destination carefully

Before you book, it's a good idea to consider carefully where you travel to.

Firstly you need to make sure your consultant or doctor is happy for you to travel there.

Medical professionals may factor in any inoculations you might need, the location and quality of medical treatment, and the dangers of any diseases prevalent in the area.

Remember different countries have different rules on certain medications, particularly pain killers, so make sure to check the rules before you go.

Destination also plays a big part in how much you will be charged for insurance.

While it difficult to quantify, the medical costs, the costs of repatriation from destinations further afield and the strength (or rather weakness) of the pound have an impact on the premium you will be quoted.

The US is notoriously expensive, as is the Caribbean and Canada.

The cost of a hospital bed in the US for example can be up to $5,000 per day, or $10,000 in intensive care, according to MoneySupermarket data. Even countries closer to home can be expensive, with a price tag of €10,000 for a minor surgery or €750 per day for a bed in a Spanish hospital.

This of course has knock-on effects on the price you pay for cover in these countries. For example, someone with breast cancer, diagnosed 3-5 years ago still could expect to pay £18.80 for insurance for a two-week trip to France but £75.55 for a holiday in the USA according to AllClear.

Many companies and comparison sites therefore split policies into three camps, Europe, Worldwide and Worldwide excluding US.

A good way to help drop costs even further afield is to look for a country with a reciprocal health care agreement in place with the UK.

While it's unclear what will happen after we leave the EU, your EHIC card still currently covers you for free or discounted treatment within Europe if you fall ill.

Remember though, this is not a substitute for insurance as it won't cover you for getting home or cancellation cover, for ecample.

Other countries including Australia and New Zealand have similar agreements in certain circumstances such as inpatient treatment in an emergency. You can find out more on the NHS website.

Check first: Make sure you ask your doctor if they are happy for you to travel first, your insurer may ask for proof

Make sure you are covered for cancellations

It's sensible to do your research on the destination first and make sure you can get cover before you book an expensive holiday.

That said, you must make sure to buy your insurance as early as possible, as soon as you have booked, to make sure you are covered for cancellations should you fall ill or anything happen before your holiday.

The devil's in the detail

Travel insurance comes with a lot of small print, but it’s important not to ignore it particularly if you have a complicated medical history.

Here are a few bits of small print you should make sure to double check.

What's the excess?

If the deal looks too good to be true, it may be that you will be expected to cover a large chunk of the cost yourself.

Therefore when choosing your policy make sure you factor in the excess, both the policy and medical excess.

It's possible to get policies with no excess or set them higher yourself to cut the costs of your premium, but make sure it's not so high you won't be able to afford to claim.

What about friends and family travelling with you?

Don’t forget to check who your insurer will pay-up for.

If you get stuck in a foreign hospital you will likely want loved-ones close by so make sure it will cover replacement flights and accommodation for others you are travelling with.

Check the limits

Take a moment before you book to think about the level of cover and whether it suits your needs.

While price is important, you need to make sure the limits are high enough for you, all of them will be slightly different.

This doesn't just mean medical cover, it also means the value of your belongings and any foreign currency you are taking for example.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office suggests you need a minimum £1 million of medical expenses for holidays in Europe and as much as £2 million of cover for the USA and rest of the world.

What about repatriation?

If you fall ill while abroad only some policies will pay to get you home.

If you are seriously unwell, this won't be as simple as a commercial flight - you might need specialist equipment, or a medical escort, which can be expensive.

Sports exclusions

Insurers often won't cover your for certain activities abroad unless you add on extra sports cover or buy a more premium policy.

This doesn't just apply to the most high risk activities such as whitewater rafting or bungee jumping, it can often apply to simple holiday activities such as scuba diving below a certain depth, jet skiing or horse riding.","That's how it feels for thousands of people with a complicated medical history or long-term health problem battling to get affordable travel insurance each year.

The partnership between Newcastle Council, the NSW Government and Compass Housing will see the development of an affordable housing development in Newcastle’s inner city, with the council, state and Compass each set to contribute $3 million towards the precinct.

The building will include 17 one and two-bedroom units on Station Street, Wickham, with eight to be reserved for key workers such as emergency services personnel and teachers and nine for social housing tenants.

Lord Mayor of Newcastle City Council Nuatali Nelmes said that rent will be capped at 30 per cent of household incomes.

“The joint venture will provide homes close to transport and jobs to ensure a healthy diversity of inner-city residents as part of council’s well-rounded city centre revitalisation efforts,” she said.

“Without affordable housing in growth corridors, many people will struggle to find suitable accommodation and be forced out of these areas.”

Clr Nelmes called on other councils, NGOs, government agencies and the community to take action to increase the amount of affordable housing.

Professor Nicole Gurran, an urban planner at the University of Sydney who focuses on housing sustainability, said such partnerships are highly valuable in helping to address housing affordability.

“Councils partnering with non-profits is an ideal way to deliver new affordable housing models – supporting growth in the affordable housing sector while also demonstrating to the wider market what can be done,” she told Government News.

“Often these partnerships feature great design while still being cost effective, and are an increasingly important way to deliver homes that meet a spectrum of housing needs within the local community.”

Professor Peter Phibbs, head of urban and regional planning and policy at the University of Sydney, said councils often underestimate the importance of such partnerships.

“Given the size of the problem and the fact no one organisation has all the required capacity, partnerships are incredibly important,” he said.

Better planning needed: analysis

The need for councils to address the affordable housing shortage through more inclusive planning has been highlighted in a recent report by the Australian Urban and Housing Research Institute (AHURI).

Affordable housing can be better supported as part of the planning and development process, the report says.

“There is significant potential to expand the use of inclusionary approaches in Australia as a means of integrating affordable homes within wider planning and development processes. However, approaches must be tailored to local market conditions,” it found.

While inclusive planning tools have resulted in around 43 per cent of total affordable housing output in the UK, the use of such housing schemes in Australia remains limited, according to the AHURI report.

“A national approach to growing the affordable housing sector is fundamental, supported by cheaper access to finance as well as appropriate subsidy/funding including access to land through government land disposal programs and inclusionary planning approaches,” the analysis found.

“Enhanced capacity is needed at the local government level—where housing strategies depend on local champions and where overarching housing supply targets are planned and implemented.”

The report recommends that state laws regulating development planning by local governments support the inclusion of affordable housing precincts based on local housing need and capacity.

Professor Phibbs, who co-authored the report with Professor Gurran, said that inclusionary planning is an important tool for councils but noted that it requires the state’s support.

The report also called for an independent national level advisory board to be established to advise on housing affordability.=

Credit: Craebby Crabbson via Flickr CC

On Tuesday, August 21, EPA published a proposed rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. The proposal, entitled the ""Affordable Clean Energy Rule,"" would establish a framework for controlling CO 2 emissions from existing power plants which is significantly less effective and environmentally protective than its predecessor. Here are six important things to know about the proposed rule:

1. The proposal sets a very low bar for emissions reductions.

The Clean Air Act mandates that the performance standards established for existing sources under Section 111(d) must reflect the ""best system of emissions reduction"" (BSER) for the pollutant and source category being regulated. EPA is proposing to define the BSER for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing power plants as on-site, heat-rate efficiency improvements. In other words, the performance standards established for power plants would only reflect those emission reductions that can be achieved through making the existing plants more efficient—they would not reflect the much larger reductions that could be achieved by switching to cleaner energy sources and improving demand-side energy efficiency (often referred to as measures ""outside the fence line"" of power plants). As a result, the standards will be considerably less stringent.

The standards may also fail to ensure emissions reductions at all, insofar as there may be a ""rebound effect"" wherein plants that implement heat-rate improvements may be called upon to run more hours, thus increasing the total amount of CO 2 generated (while still complying with performance standards). EPA explicitly recognizes the potential for such a rebound effect in the proposal without providing any recommendation for mitigating the effect.

2. There are no numerical standards or targets for GHG reductions, and states will have wide latitude to establish their own performance targets.

The Clean Power Plan established numerical emissions reduction targets for states based on the application of the BSER to power plants within those states. These targets were an essential element of the implementation framework insofar as they provided a benchmark against which to gauge state progress. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule does not establish any emissions reduction standards or targets for states. Rather, EPA is proposing to issue a list of ""candidate technologies"" that states can use to establish standards of performance for individual power plants within their jurisdiction. EPA is also proposing to let states set weaker standards (or no standards at all) based on their assessment of the plant's ""remaining useful life"" (based on language in Section 111(d), which recognizes that performance standards should account for this factor). In effect, the rule allows states to decide how much to cut emissions, if at all, rather than providing numeric targets for them.

3. The proposal would have a net cost to U.S. citizens of billions of dollars.

Many environmental and public health advocates have expressed concern about the foregone health and emissions benefits associated with this proposal. EPA had projected that the original Clean Power Plan would reduce CO 2 emissions by approximately 415 million tons relative to a no-action baseline, whereas the Affordable Clean Energy rule would only reduce CO 2 emissions by 14-27 million tons relative to a no-action baseline. This emissions increase corresponds with a significant reduction in health benefits: EPA estimates that replacing the Clean Power Plan with this proposal will cause an additional 470-1,400 premature deaths, 48,000 cases of exacerbated asthma, and 21,000 missed school days as compared to a baseline where the Clean Power Plan is implemented.

There are also staggering differences in monetized net benefits from the two rules. It is somewhat difficult to compare these benefits because, as we noted in our comments on the proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, EPA has significantly revised its cost-benefit methodology to downplay benefits and overstate costs associated with climate regulations. Before it changed its methodology, EPA had estimated that the Clean Power Plan would deliver net health and climate benefits ranging from $26-$46 billion per year by 2030. EPA now claims that replacing the Clean Power Plan with this proposal ""could provide $400 million in net benefits"" but the underlying regulatory impact analysis (RIA) completely undermines this claim. Even with its modified cost-benefit methodology, EPA finds that replacing the Clean Power Plan with this rule would actually result in billions of dollars of net ""foregone benefits"" (i.e. costs) under every scenario analyzed. This is illustrated in Tables ES-12 and ES-13 of the RIA:

4. The proposal includes major changes to permitting rules that could lead to additional increases in air pollution.

EPA quietly incorporated a major modification to the New Source Review (NSR) program into this proposal—specifically, a new provision which would allow states the option to adopt a new test for determining whether a physical or operational change at a power plant qualifies as a ""major modification"" (which triggers a variety of NSR requirements pertaining to permitting, emissions monitoring, and emissions control). Currently, the NSR process is triggered if a change is predicted to cause a significant net increase in the facility's annual emissions, but under the new test, sources could use an alternate test whereby NSR is only triggered if there is a significant net increase in hourly emissions. EPA claims this change is needed to encourage utilities to invest in efficiency improvements (even though the rule already requires this), but critics contend that it is just another way of undermining Clean Air Act protections by allowing facilities to increase their emissions without triggering NSR requirements.

5. The legal fate of the proposal depends on the legal fate of the Clean Power Plan, which is already tied up in litigation.

The D.C. Circuit granted EPA's request to place the litigation involving the Clean Power Plan on hold pending EPA's reconsideration of the rule. One of the key questions in that case was whether Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act authorized EPA to issue quantitative emission guidelines based on a BSER that includes ""beyond the fence line"" measures such as fuel switching. In this proposal and the proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, EPA made it very clear that it no longer believes it has such authority. Indeed, this is EPA's entire rationale for confining the BSER to on-site heat rate improvements. One critical question is whether the D.C. Circuit will agree with EPA's new interpretation, as this bears on the fate of both rules. It would therefore make sense for the D.C. Circuit to revisit the case sooner rather than later to issue a decision on this matter, as that would be more efficient from a judicial management perspective and would shorten the lag time before one of the rules can take effect.

6. The proposal will not save the coal industry.

President Trump and EPA claim that this rule will help save the coal industry, but there is little evidence to support this. There is no doubt that the coal industry is in decline: since 2010, hundreds of coal-fired power plants—nearly 40 percent of the U.S. coal fleet—have been retired. Most experts believe that this decline is largely driven by many different factors, including the decreasing price of natural gas and renewables, changes in consumer preferences, and other forms of regulation (e.g., controls on conventional air pollutants). The proposed replacement rule would have a very modest effect on the industry as compared with these factors, and the coal industry would still face the prospect of regulation by states and the next administration. In light of all this, experts anticipate that market forces will continue to drive the coal industry's decline in the foreseeable future. Indeed, according to this report just issued by West Virginia University, the only thing propping up the coal industry in recent years has been exports, and those are endangered by President Trump's trade war.

Recent proposed rule can be better understood by considering the fate of the Clean Power Plan in the Supreme Court.

Font Size: A A A

The Trump Administration recently took the latest step in its effort to overhaul climate change regulations put in place under the Obama Administration. If finalized, President Donald J. Trump’s proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE) would replace the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the Obama Administration’s signature environmental regulation aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from generating plants. ACE’s more lax emission standards clearly fit within this current Administration’s deregulatory goals, but they also likely are needed to clear many of the legal hurdles that doomed the CPP.

Issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015, the CPP aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions primarily by requiring states to demand the owners of electric plants to switch from reliance on generators that use high-emission fuels such as coal to generators that use lower-emission or zero-emission fuels. The CPP never went into effect because it was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in February, 2016 amid legal challenges by various states and industry groups.

Just a week ago, President Trump’s EPA proposed ACE to replace the CPP. ACE would not require that owners of generating plants reduce their reliance on generators that use high-emission fuels and increase their use of technology that uses low-emission or zero-emission fuels. Instead, the proposed rule would set “emission guidelines” and require states to submit plans to reduce generating plant emissions. The rule would identify “candidate technologies” for states to use in these plans to make on-site efficiency upgrades to individual generating plants.

Many people compare the CPP with ACE, and they conclude that ACE is bad policy because any emissions reductions that ACE might yield are much lower than the emissions reductions that the CPP would have produced. For instance, in a front page headline, The New York Times refers to the Trump EPA’s “intention to replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan” with ACE. The reporters then criticize ACE because the proposed rule would “add another 47 to 61 million tons of CO 2 ” and increase emissions of particulate matter by an amount that “could lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths a year by 2030.”

Those statements, however, are based on the assumption that the CPP would be in effect if EPA did not replace it with ACE. That assumption is false. The CPP is not in effect, and it would not be in effect today even if President Obama were still in office.

The five-justice majority that voted to stay the CPP did not explain the Court’s unusual decision to stay the rule before any court had occasion to review its merits. Given the criteria for issuing a stay, however, that decision must have been based on five justices’ belief that the petitioners were likely to prevail on the merits of their legal challenge against the CPP. Since the Trump EPA later abandoned defense of the merits of the rule, no court has ever ruled on its merits.

As Emily Hammond and I explained in a 2016 article, the strongest argument the petitioners made against the CPP in their request for a stay was based on what is often called the “beyond-the-fence-line” issue. The petitioners argued that EPA’s regulatory power was limited to requiring changes to individual generating plants that could be made within the fence line of a plant. They argued that EPA did not have the regulatory authority to require plant owners to substitute low-emission or zero-emission generating plants for high-emission coal-fired plants, because that would require the owners of generating plants to take actions “beyond the fence line” of an individual generating plant.

Fuel-switching requirements were central to the CPP and its carbon emission reduction goals. One main part of the plan would have required states to reduce emissions from high-emission coal-fired generating plants by requiring owners of those plants to switch to plants that use lower-emission natural gas. The second main part would have required states to reduce emissions from generating plants by requiring owners of plants that use fossil fuels to switch to plants that rely on zero-emission sources such as solar and wind. A third part would have accomplished a much more modest reduction of emissions by requiring owners of some generating plants to improve the rate of efficiency at which the plants operate.

The petitioners argued that EPA could not require mandatory fuel switching because this requirement did not qualify as a “standard of performance” within the meaning of Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the statute that EPA relied on as the basis for issuing the CPP. Petitioners argued that a standard of performance must refer to something that can be done at a plant site—such as a required improvement in the efficiency of a generating plant or addition of a pollution control device that would limit emissions from a plant. If that argument is right, EPA could not regulate “beyond the fence line” of a generating plant by requiring owners to substitute low-emission or zero-emission plants for higher-emission plants.

If I am correct about the reason the majority stayed the CPP, the Obama Administration could have successfully defended the merits of the two main parts of the CPP only by persuading five justices that they were wrong when they predicted that the petitioners would prevail on the merits. That was a theoretical but highly unlikely possibility. If the majority adhered to its preliminary belief that EPA cannot regulate “beyond the fence line,” the Obama Administration would have been able to defend successfully only the relatively minor part of the CPP that required the owners of some generating plants to improve the operational efficiency of their plants.

It is impossible for EPA to reduce emissions from generating plants significantly without regulating “beyond the fence line.” EPA officials in the Obama Administration and many scholars who share their desire to mitigate climate change have searched in vain for other ways in which EPA can use its existing statutory authority to further that goal.

In other words, any replacement for the CPP that could survive Supreme Court review necessarily would provide only a small fraction of the emissions reductions that the CPP would have produced. To evaluate ACE, the expected effects of ACE on carbon emissions should be compared with the status quo ante—that is, the level of emissions that would be produced by a regulatory system that includes neither ACE nor the CPP. If ACE would reduce emissions using that basis of comparison, it would accomplish an improvement in air quality, albeit a modest improvement.

The comparisons of ACE’s expected effects with the CPP’s expected effects, however, do serve one useful purpose. They illustrate the ability of Congress to significantly reduce emissions of all pollutants by enacting a statute that gives EPA more effective tools to mitigate climate change—or, even better, a statute that imposes a substantial tax on carbon. Such a statute could yield emissions reductions far greater than the CPP would have produced, along with improvements to social welfare measured both in terms of climate change mitigation and human health.","If finalized, President Donald J.

Catholic groups voiced dismay and disagreement with a proposed rule from the Trump administration to weaken regulations on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants that in the process could result in 1,400 more premature deaths annually.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Aug. 21 unveiled the new rule, called the Affordable Clean Energy rule. If adopted, it would replace the Clean Power Plan — the 2015 Obama-era rule that formed the cornerstone of the previous president's climate change policy and sought to limit carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants by 32 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2030. By contrast, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule would limit carbon emissions by 0.7 percent to 1.5 percent over the same time frame. Carbon pollution is the primary driver of climate change, with the power sector long being the largest source of such emissions in the country but recently surpassed by transportation; earlier this month, the EPA also moved to roll back fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The EPA said that the Clean Power Plan, issued by the agency under President Barack Obama but which never went into effect, exceeded its regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act by pursuing measures outside of power plants and attempting to prioritize renewable energy sources over fossil fuels. ""The ACE Rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans,"" Andrew Wheeler, EPA acting administrator, said in a press release.

The rule would give states greater flexibility in setting their own emissions reductions standards to comply with EPA guidelines. It emphasizes efficiency improvements at coal plants rather than replacing them, a move critics say would exacerbate climate change by allowing coal plants to keep firing and polluting, while supporters see it as a way to boost a declining industry that has seen 200-plus coal plant closings since 2010. ""We are putting our great coal miners back to work,"" Trump said at a rally Aug. 21 in Charleston, West Virginia. He later added ""We're cancelling Obama's illegal anti-coal destroying regulations."" At one point, he spoke of the ""indestructible"" nature of coal, compared to other energy forms. ""In times of war, in times of conflict, you can blow up those windmills. They fall down real quick. You can blow up those pipelines. … You can do a lot of things to those solar panels. But you know what you can't hurt? Coal. You can do whatever you want to coal,"" the president said. The Catholic Climate Covenant, in a statement expressing ""disappointment"" with the proposed weaker standards, cited Pope Francis' encyclical ""Laudato Si', on Care for Our Common Home"" where the pope stated ""We know that technology on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels — especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas — needs to be progressively replaced without delay.""

""By law, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to reduce pollution contributing to climate change, to protect human health and to promote clean air. This new proposal does none of those things,"" Catholic Climate Covenant Executive Director Dan Misleh said. The Leadership Conference of Women Religious, one of Catholic Climate Covenant's 17 national partners, said they were ""deeply troubled"" by the effort to roll back the Clean Power Plan, particularly given the United States' historical standing as the world's largest carbon polluter. ""We call on all people of good will to join us in opposing this rule that threatens the health and safety of our neighbors and our planet home,"" LCWR said.

An EPA analysis of the Affordable Clean Energy rule estimated its implementation could lead to 470 to 1,400 more premature deaths among adults annually by 2030, in part due to the increased release of air pollutants tied to heart and lung disease, as well as asthma and bronchitis. In addition, the agency's report anticipated 48,000 additional cases of exacerbated asthma, 42,000 lost work days and 21,000 school absences. By comparison, analyses of the Clean Power Plan projected it would prevent up to 6,600 premature deaths, and as many as 150,000 childhood asthma attacks and 2,800 hospital admissions. In a statement, the Adrian Dominicans said the Affordable Clean Energy rule, in addition threatening long-term efforts to address climate change, ""also presents a clear and present danger"" through its impact on human health. The Franciscan Action Network called the Affordable Clean Energy rule ""inexcusable"" and a clear attempt ""to put profit before people and planet."" ""There is no excuse for this recklessness that will lead to a lower quality of life for thousands of Americans, especially those in lower income communities where many older coal powered plants are housed,"" said Franciscan Action Network Executive Director Patrick Carolan. ""This is a deliberate decision by the Trump administration to once again target poor brown and black communities, which will unilaterally lead to more deaths."" The Rev. Susan Hendershot, president of Interfaith Power & Light, said the rule's projected increase in lives lost is ""unacceptable."" ""The EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment,"" she said in a statement. Faith groups, which backed the Clean Power Plan throughout its many, at times tumultuous, stages, have consistently highlighted the health impacts of polluting power plants on nearby communities, often people of color. Coal miners have also spoken out, including at a December listening session on the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, about the health complications they have suffered from the burning of coal.

In comments to The New York Times, EPA's assistant administrator on air and radiation William Wehrum acknowledged ""collateral effects"" from the proposed rule but said that the agency had legal authority to directly address other air pollutants that can cause health issues. EPA estimated replacing the Clean Power Plan with its proposed rule could result $400 million in annual net benefits and up to $6.4 billion in avoided compliance costs — down from its projection of $33 billion in savings in October. On the cost of regulations, the Franciscan Action Network pointed to a 2017 draft report to Congress that found major federal regulations over the past decade yielded between $287 billion and nearly $1 trillion in benefits while costing between $78 billion and $115 billion. As for EPA's clean air regulations, the report estimated benefits ranging from $182 billion to $684 billion, at a cost of approximately $50-60 billion. Repeal of the Clean Power Plan was a primary focus once Trump entered the Oval Office and was initiated by then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who joined a lawsuit against the pollutions standards. The proposed new rule was signed by Pruitt's successor Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist. EPA projects once the Affordable Clean Energy rule is fully implemented, reductions in carbon emissions, combined with progress already made, of approximately 33 percent to 34 percent below 2005 levels. While some environmental groups have long contended that the Clean Power Plan didn't go far enough, they hold that overall emissions reductions would still be greater under those standards.

The reduction of carbon emissions is integral to efforts to limit climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, the global community agreed to take measures to hold average global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 Fahrenheit). Since 1901, the planet has warmed 1 degrees C (1.8 F). Scientists project that as the planet warms, the impacts of climate change — including increased droughts and more intense heatwaves, extreme storms, flooding and wildfires — will continue to worsen and likely become irreversible once the planet crosses the 2-degrees benchmark. Combined with the planned U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement and the potential halting of increased vehicle emissions standards, the weakened rule on power plant pollution ""continues the Trump Administration's dangerous assault on efforts to address the long-term impacts of deleterious climate change,"" the Adrian Dominicans said. ""These troubling actions move us, as a people and nation, away from the 'new and universal solidarity' that is required to address the existential threat of global climate change. That solidarity, as Pope Francis wrote in Laudato Sí, is with the whole community of life on God's Earth,"" the sisters said. Religious communities and organizations have reported witnessing the devastation on human life resulting from a warming planet in areas where they minister around the globe. The Missionary Society of St. Columban pointed to regions facing intense drought like California and Pakistan, and others struck by extreme storms, like Fiji and the Philippines, as providing firsthand knowledge of ""the consequences of a weakened commitment to climate action.""","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Aug. 21 unveiled the new rule, called the Affordable Clean Energy rule.

Written by: | Published:

Creating an affordable, renewable and sustainable source of energy from hydrogen could be unlocked with the innovative use of screen-printed nanotechnology.

After winning a £100,000 grant from Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) are testing a way to provide a green source of power that could be harnessed by remote communities who are off the electricity grid and reliant on imported diesel and petrol for generators. “Isolated communities often need to be self-sufficient in terms of their energy generation but rely on expensive imported fuel due to often being geographically too isolated for a gas supply to be piped to them,” said research associate Dr Samuel Rowley-Neale. “This is the perfect opportunity to explore whether we can produce a less polluting alternative to current fossil fuel-based energy generation techniques.” The idea is to print large volumes of inexpensive electrodes for use in electrolysers, which breaks water into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen can then be stored or transported and fed into fuel cells when needed to create electricity on demand as a more dependable and efficient source of fuel than solar, wind, wave and tidal energy. Dr Rowley-Neale added: “The electricity generated by wind, wave, tidal and solar power is often ill correlated to consumer demand and typically has to be fed into the National Grid where it is used instantly or must be expensively captured somehow, such as in a battery – which has issues with degradation – or else the turbines have to be shut off to ensure the generated electricity does not overload the electricity grid. “In contrast, an electrolyser creates hydrogen that can be easily stored and physically transported as a gas with no deterioration, and then later fed into a fuel cell for conversion to power when needed. And unlike the burning of fossil fuels, the only by-product is oxygen and some water that are harmless to the environment.” It builds on previous MMU work into finding an alternate way of manufacturing electrodes that are traditionally reliant on components made from expensive platinum and iridium metal elements whose cost prohibits cheap reproduction. Under the project, the MMU team plans to screen print the electrodes with graphene-like nanotechnology embedded in a carbon-based printer ink at the University’s new £4 million Manchester Fuel Cell Innovation Centre. The technique will enable the electrodes to be printed in novel shapes and styles, as well as allowing them to be mass produced for industrial applications. The researchers are collaborating with the European Marine Energy Centre, a test and development centre for wave and tidal devices based on Orkney, Scotland, to research the capabilities and performance of the screen-printed electrolysers, the cells and the fuel cells. There will be six months of electrode development at the University followed by installation of the electrolyser stack in Scotland and connection to a renewable energy system and then a further six months’ harsh weather testing.

Energy forms the foundation of any economic transformation. Kenya’s Vision 2030 development blueprint envisions these ideals - offering opportunities to its citizens. Economic growth means increased energy demand and consumption. Additionally, the growing human population is leading to increased energy demands.

It is unfortunate that despite the growing patterns of energy demands and consumption, Kenya’s electricity prices have been highly unstable. The Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced an increase in electricity prices, which has put pressure on middle class households’ economies. Consequently, most Kenyan households find electricity out of their reach, hence opt for the traditional ‘dirty’ forms of energy such as kerosene for cooking and lighting.

It may be difficult to determine the reason for the unstable energy prices in Kenya since a normal electricity bill underlies the price shifts in fixed cost charge, fuel cost charge and other costs. Nonetheless, overreliance on hydroelectric power may be a major determinant in Kenya’s electricity cost fluctuation. Hydroelectric power is dependent on unpredictable rain patterns.

Adverse effects

Kenya uses imported fossil fuels such as oil to generate power as an alternative to the hydroelectric power. This exposes Kenyans’ to adverse effects of price shocks arising from international oil prices and interest rates. There are plans by the government to commission coal mining with the main aim of cushioning the nation from the unreliable hydroelectric power challenges in order to stabilise electricity prices.

The reality is that coal power plants release large amounts of air pollutants that are harmful to our health. Pollutants contribute to formation of smog that increases the risk of asthma, lung damage. Smog also damages plants. Additionally, emissions from burning coal for heat and electricity causes global warming.

Coal mining also produces vast amounts of power plant waste full of toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. These toxins are linked to health risks including cancer, organ damage, heart and brain damage.

Coal-powered electricity will intensify the effects of climate change. It also uses a lot of water which already is a scarce resource in many areas.To stabilise Kenya’s electricity prices, protect consumers from high electricity prices and achieve economic prosperity, Kenya needs to courageously cut ties with fossil fuels and pursue alternative renewable energy sources. Kenya has a significant amount of annual sunlight hours with high radiation.

The potential for wind energy is proven to be viable in various regions. Kenya’s Rift Valley basin has geothermal potential of close to 10,000MW.

Wind projects

Renewable energy will improve Kenya’s future well-being in so many other ways. It will reduce air pollution, give millions of people access to clean energy and reduce unemployment. It will also reduce future energy costs and lead to advanced sustainable development. Currently, the government is investing in geothermal, solar and wind projects - the Lake Turkana Wind Power firm and the Garissa solar power project.

These projects offer hope for Kenya’s sustainable electricity generation. However, the current situation positions Kenya’s renewable power generation way below its potential. There is a growing need for increased support from government and private entities through investments for the expansion of renewable energy sources. Kenya’s government should inject more resources into such projects to enable them come on board on time.

There is no technological barrier to achieving a pathway to increasing renewable energy uptake. With the right political will, Kenya can produce sufficient electricity from renewable sources and export the surplus to neighbouring countries. The government of Kenya must make the right choices now to create a better and cleaner future for all.

A complete transition to renewable energy and energy efficiency is technically possible, and would help Kenyans access stable and affordable electricity. What is missing is the political will to make this happen. So instead of committing resources to fossil fuel exploration such as the proposed coal power plants in Lamu and Kitui, the government should reinvest in itself and empower Kenyan engineers to explore new technologies such as the viability of mini-grids, smart-grids and off-grid technologies, that are important in ensuring stable and affordable electricity prices.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) – That green pond scum on the backyard pool may be annoying now, but it could someday fuel a jet plane to whisk you away on vacation.

And those lawn clippings? They could be used to convert algae into a mass-produced, economical biofuel to be used in cars, trucks and airplanes.

Molecular biologist Amanda Barry and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Bio-energy and Biome Sciences group are trying to determine whether one particular strain of algae can be produced at low cost and in short periods of time so that it could economically compete with fossil fuels.

“Algae hold great potential as a source of renewable fuel due to their ability to produce refinery-compatible diesel and jet fuel precursors,” Barry said in an interview last week at the New Mexico Consortium’s lab in Los Alamos.

“We are really trying to examine the unique traits of a particular algae that have the potential to be grown for algae biofuels to see if we can exploit any of these traits to improve growth or improve oil production from algae.”

The consortium is a nonprofit corporation formed by three New Mexico universities to facilitate research and increase cooperation between academia, industry and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Algae, of which there are many types, already are produced in large quantities in big outdoor ponds. But doing it faster and more cheaply is the trick. And though biofuels, such as ethanol made from corn products, have been produced for a long time, algae could be an improvement – in part because a wide range of oil products can be extracted from algae.

The long game, Barry said, is finding a new domestic source of renewable biofuels and bioproducts. By doing that, “we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, enhance the energy independence of the United States, secure energy solutions for clean energy, mitigate the impacts of global energy demand growth, and contribute to job creation in a new domestic industry,” she said.

As a child growing up in the mountains of Northern California, a 20-minute drive from the nearest neighbor, Barry started reading about Marie Curie, the famed French-Polish discoverer of radium and polonium.

She never questioned that she would become a scientist.

Barry acknowledged that she was influenced by women in science and hopes to pass that on.

“I try to be a role model for women and for girls, especially in science, and talk about my own experience so that they see that and have people that they can look up to and hopefully see that it’s possible to do what they want to do,” she said.

Barry, 42, “was always super curious about the natural world.”

She originally was interested in physics, “but I didn’t like being inside all day in an office and working on paper; I wanted to work more with living systems and so I got more into biology.” Barry has worked at LANL for six years.

She said she loves the study of algae because it’s such a diverse organism that we are only beginning to understand.

“There is so much we don’t know about algae and that we can really tap into,” she said.

In her work at the lab, Barry is being assisted by three LANL student researchers: Anna Finck of Las Vegas, New Mexico; and Jenna Schambach and Sara Lamcaj, both from New Jersey. They were busy last week as they examined algae cultures and counted algae cells to monitor growth.

Schambach said one thing she has learned from the experiments is that the strain of algae they are working with “can utilize different plants” for a food source for growth.

The work so far has been in small containers but is currently being transferred to a larger venue – a greenhouse just down the hall.

“Here at the lab, we are mostly working with algae at smaller scales than what would be done outdoors at large facilities and so we are working in flasks,” Barry said. “In the greenhouse, we also have some small mini-ponds that mimic what it would be like outdoors at larger scale with little paddle wheels.”

The paddles help give the algae air and keep it moving so light is uniformly distributed.

After algae are harvested from large outdoor tanks, it is converted into biocrude oil and can then “be put into the existing refinery system to make biodiesel, gasoline and jet fuel,” Barry said.

In the future, LANL will look for an industrial partner already growing algae outdoors “to work with them to see if this would help their process in actually boosting growth and boosting the products they are looking for,” Barry said.

While algae may be a future superstar in the biofuels research arena, it is not the lone ranger. About 30 people at LANL are engaged in all sorts of biofuel research, which has been going on since 2009, said Babetta Marrone, senior scientist and biofuels program manager.","They could be used to convert algae into a mass-produced, economical biofuel to be used in cars, trucks and airplanes.

The Sylphy, a version of the midsize sedan known as the Nissan Sentra in other markets, is the company’s best selling model in China. This week, the Sylphy Zero Emissions began production at the Nissan Dongfeng factory in Huadu. It is the first electric car from Nissan designed specifically for sale to Chinese drivers.

What is a Sylphy ZE? It is an amalgam of the Sentra body style and LEAF running gear. It is built on the same chassis as the latest version of the LEAF and the styling has been modified from the regular Sylphy to more closely resemble that car. It has a range of 210 miles using the Chinese testing protocol according to Motor 1.

The Sylphy ZE is aimed specifically at the lower end of the electric car market. Priced at $25,850 after available incentives, it costs about half the price of the Nissan LEAF sold locally by the Nissan and Dongfeng’s joint venture under the Venucia brand. The least expensive electrics in China sell for around $22,000 after incentives.

“We’re confident that the Sylphy Zero Emission rolling off the production line today will become a main player in the EV market,” Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa tells the Associated Press. “We’re going to roll out a range of EVs that will appeal to customers within all market segments.”

In a report by Automotive World, Saikawa also says, “China is already the world’s largest automotive market. But China isn’t just a leader in terms of market size: It stands at the forefront of the development of the industry itself. The market is now evolving extremely quickly, especially in the areas of electrification and connectivity. In fact, China is expected to lead the world in the adoption and spread of EVs in the coming years.”

“We’re confident that the Sylphy Zero Emission rolling off the production line today will become a main player in the EV market here. It’s going to pave the way for our Nissan Intelligent Mobility strategy in the Chinese market. By the end of 2019, DFL plans to launch five new EV models across the Nissan, Venucia and Dongfeng brands. We’re going to roll out a range of EVs that will appeal to customers within all market segments.”

The Chinese government has set a target of 2 million electric cars sold in China a year by 2020. As aggressive as that goal may be, it still represents less than 10% of the total Chinese new car market. Manufacturers are desperate to sell more electric cars in China, where new government low emissions policies require them to buy credits from other companies if they fail to do so.

Electric cars are given the highest number of credits under that system. Plug-in hybrids get the next highest number of credits and conventional hybrids the lowest of all. Conventional cars, of course, get no credits, which will tend to drive up their prices and make electric cars more competitive.

Dongfeng and Nissan announced earlier this year they intend to develop 20 electric models as part of a $10 billion investment program over the next 5 years. Three of those models will appear this year and three more “affordable EV” compacts are scheduled to arrive in 2019.

At the moment, Nissan says it has no plans to sell the Sylphy ZE outside of China, so if you want a selfie with a Sylphy ZE, you will have to go to China to get one.","Nissan and Dongfeng have jointly produced 10 million vehicles for sale to consumers in China over the past 15 years.

They decided to do this in the beautifully lush and green countryside of Nuevo Arenal, in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica.

“We decided to move to Costa Rica for many reasons,” says Allison. “We thought we’d like to do something really different once we retired. We wanted to challenge ourselves, so learning a new language and integrating into a new culture seemed like a good way to do that.” They found that they were drawn to Costa Rica for its stable government, zero military presence, and its strong focus on clean energy.

“Jeff’s brother and his wife were moving down and we love being near them,” Allison says. Being close to family and having a plane ride that’s only a few hours back to the U.S. sealed the deal. The Spencers knew Costa Rica was just the adventure they had been looking for.

Jeff and Allison chose the quaint town of Nuevo Arenal, because it ticked many of their boxes. “We had visited other areas of the country, but Nuevo Arenal had the temperatures we preferred. There is no need to heat or cool your home here,” says Allison. The town is tucked away on the Northeast side of the approximately 40-square-mile Lake Arenal. Besides a large, warm, and welcoming expat community, Nuevo Arenal is home to multiple grocery stores, a hardware store, a local utilities office, a police station, and a community health clinic.

Arenal also offers a wide array of delicious restaurant choices. The food is locally grown and very fresh and delicious. “I recently had a nice jumbo shrimp dinner: tempura shrimp with passion fruit sauce, fresh steamed veggies, and potatoes for less than $9,” Allison says. “We often pay approximately $4.50 to $6 for an ample breakfast. You can also spend approximately $100 for a fantastic three-course dinner for two with dessert and drinks at one of the highest-rated restaurants in the country, and almost everyone says it is well worth the price.”

With their monthly budget of about $2,000, the Spencers find that their money goes further in Costa Rica than it did back home. Grocery shopping is less expensive, especially if you stay away from buying imported brand names. They also find that their monthly utility costs are lower than those back in the States. The Spencers own their own custom-built home in Nuevo Arenal, but say that there are affordable local-style homes (usually made from concrete) ranging in price from $30,000 to $40,000. They admit that you’d most likely want to upgrade one of those homes. Homes that are built to North American standards can be found from a little over $100,000 to over a million, and every price point in between. Rents can range from approximately $100 for a rustic home up to $1,000 for something that’s fabulous. You can find a comfortable home rental for around $500 to $600 a month.

Costa Rica also offers plenty of diverse eco-adventure activities to satisfy Jeff and Allison’s healthy lifestyle, ranging from swimming at some of the most beautiful beaches the country has to offer (like Playa Manuel Antonio and Playa Hermosa) or trekking along the Misitco Hanging Bridges located near La Fortuna (just a short drive away from Nuevo Arenal) to enjoying a hike through the Monteverde Cloud Forest. All these activities can be reached within just a few hours of one another, so there’s always something fun to do.

Couple this with the close proximity of the Liberia Airport, and you can see why Nuevo Arenal offered this couple just what they needed to start the next chapter of their lives: A thriving local community, great restaurants and local shopping, a huge expat community, and lots of eco-fun to be had.

Credit: SOLACE

Wealth-generating, flat-pack solar houses and a profit-sharing scheme that incentivises retrofitting are bringing sustainable living to people who would otherwise not be able to afford it.

""One of the biggest problems that we see right now is (the creation of) a big gap between the lower and the middle classes. Everyone is talking about this growing inequality gap,"" said Bart Glowacki, co-founder of SOLACE, a start-up based in Warsaw, Poland, set up with the aim of making sustainable housing widely affordable.

Tighter mortgage controls, job insecurity and high student debts in Europe has meant that it is increasingly difficult for young people to buy their own homes.

""Ordinary people are no longer able to afford their basic needs. Millennials, who are the future leaders, can't even afford an apartment or a house,"" said Glowacki.

Yet, as inequality grows, public awareness about the environment, climate change, energy efficiency and sustainability are on the rise. According to a 2017 Eurobarometer climate change report, about three-quarters of Europeans believe climate change is a serious problem while 90% have taken actions to combat it.

With these issues in mind, SOLACE has developed an energy-neutral flat-pack house targeted at people aged between 28 to 38.

SOLACE makes, sells and ships the house parts. Right now, they have built one house that will serve as an exhibition model for potential clients, but Glowacki says that small-scale production will start soon and they hope to secure more funding to scale up.

SOLACE's house costs €25,000 and is delivered in a package of about 6m long. It can be assembled by four people using a crane, but the start-up supplies assembly teams if required. The house consists of a small kitchen, a 20m2 living-dining room and a small bathroom on the ground floor, and a mezzanine level bedroom.

Surplus energy

While other flat-pack houses exist, SOLACE's innovation is a roof of solar panels which powers the home, but also earns income for the homeowner by producing surplus energy which in certain countries can then be sold to the local power grid.

""We believe that SOLACE house is the first house in Europe that actually can produce more energy than the average family consumes,"" said Głowacki, although he admits that customers in countries with less sun exposure during the winter months would only benefit from reduced environmental impact and energy bills.

""When a family spends more than 40% of their disposable income (on heating and electricity costs), they will pretty much cash out every end of the month, because the housing overburden is too heavy for them, said Głowacki, who believes that utility costs financially cripple households. ""We think that SOLACE can really fight this.""

But it's not just individuals who could have an incentive to invest in sustainable housing. A pilot project called LEMON plans to assist and encourage private companies to invest in retrofits for existing social housing in Italy through an EU scheme.

The scheme, usually applied to large public construction projects, enables investors to profit from the energy savings generated by the retrofits. It's the first time that such an initiative has been rolled out in Italy, according to Dr. Claudia Carani, coordinator of LEMON.

""We need to show a different business model that could be really interesting to accelerate investment,"" said Dr. Carani.

27 towns

LEMON will tender contracts in September and retrofitting will begin in 2019 in 27 towns in two Italian provinces, Reggio Emilia and Parma. The 622 houses that will be retrofitted are currently highly inefficient, averaging a G rating according to the EU energy labelling schemein which A is highly efficient. LEMON plans to bring these homes up to a C rating by replacing the windows, changing the heating system for a modern boiler-based one and installing smart temperature control systems. Dr. Carani says these changes would generate €15,290 million in energy savings.

The project also plans to teach the residents, a mix of locals and migrants, how to use the new retrofits which will provide better insulation and reduce heating costs.

Elsewhere, grassroots organisation Czech Sustainable Houses wants to make sustainable homes more widely available by driving the need for such housing. Part of how they do this is by pushing innovation for sustainable housing forward – not least, through their annual architecture student competition.

Currently in its third year, the contest asks students in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to design sustainable, attractive and economically viable houses.

""A large part of our activities is making sure that we communicate in a way that people get excited and give them a good feeling that there is a good future waiting for them,"" said founder Pavel Podruh.

While the contest criteria change every year—this year's brief is to design a complex of five buildings each with three apartments—Podruh says a critical test is viability.

The prize is judged by a jury comprising of architecture, science and energy experts and the winners receive 30,000 Czech koruna, equivalent to EUR 1,170 while their sketch is converted into a life-size liveable prototype. The first two will be completed next year. When the prototypes are ready, the public will be able to rent them out for short stays to experience sustainable living.

""Anyone can stay in these houses and try this new way of living and see that it's not so different to what they are used to,"" said Podruh, whose organisation won first prize in the Young Energy Leaders category of the EU Sustainable Energy Awards in June.

The organisation has no plans to commercialise the prototypes. Instead, their goal is to highlight the need for sustainable housing initiatives and spur governments, policymakers and private companies into action.

""We really want to create a large demand for houses. We are intentionally creating this pressure on the market to adjust, to innovate,"" said Podruh. ""We never wanted to be a construction company—we show novel ways to build houses, and we create the demand but we don't satisfy it – intentionally.""

Nearly 15,000 homes were damaged or destroyed during the October 2017 wildfires that raged across Northern and Southern California, leaving thousands of families homeless. Due to a severe construction labor shortage and the need for soil testing and permitting on the affected sites, many residents will wait years, not months, to rebuild.

They will wait, that is, unless they are clients of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Connect Homes. The prefab residential design and building company aims to have clients who lost houses into new, non-combustible homes within a year. Bringing quick-build expertise and relying on a carefully chosen palette of fireproof materials, the Connect Homes team is skilled at working on an accelerated construction timeline.

For those who lost their homes to the fires, Connect Homes provides free site assessments, cuts design fees in half, and fast tracks their projects. Around 10 to 15 clients have already signed contracts, and the first few expect to move into their new homes this summer.

In fact, the company’s quickly constructed dwellings will translate into savings of nearly four years and tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for these homeowners, and its services will no doubt be in demand for homeowners currently dealing with this summer's wildfire outbreak.

When Gordon Stott founded Connect Homes with Jared Levy in 2012, the architects set out to create a firm to design and build houses with modern aesthetics, sustainable features, and site-specific details for middle-class buyers. The two had worked together for more than five years at award-winning Los Angeles architecture firm Marmol Radziner, where Levy ran the prefab division. Both Levy and Stott felt they could solve the problems keeping high-design prefab houses out of reach for typical home buyers.

Founded with the mission of bringing high-quality design to average home buyers, the company builds houses for about a third of traditional site-built construction costs, based on average costs per square foot in California.

Their approach encompasses an unchanging modular steel structure that allows the company to deliver components via standard shipping containers. This was key to getting costs down, Stott explains.

“There’s no longer a need for wide loads or special permits to drive through each county or state, which means delivering a two-story house to Connecticut costs us around $25,000,” Stott says. The pair had previously calculated a similar delivery with pieces larger than the shipping container would cost around $400,000.

Their other core company philosophy involves thinking of houses like products. Nearly 90% of each Connect house is fabricated in the factory, resulting in significant reductions in cost, time, and waste compared to a site-built dwelling. The various models range from $250 to $300 per square foot, and take about six to eight weeks to build, deliver, and assemble after permitting. While the house is being built in the factory, foundation is laid on-site to prepare for delivery and assembly and expedite the completion timeline, which spans from a few days to a week.

The idea of houses as off-the-shelf products extends to the design process. Levy and Stott created several models with distinct floor plans and programs. Connect Homes received state-level inspections and approvals for building those exact plans—which cuts down on permitting time.

Clients can still individualize their homes to their liking, and are offered material, finish, and color options inside and out. While they can’t change-up wall configurations, they can decide on the amount and placement of windows to maximize views, open up rooms to ocean breezes, or protect interiors from harsh sun exposure. Most models also come with at least one alternative floor plan adjustment. For example, a client can opt to transform the roomy covered deck on one plan into an enclosed dining room.

Some of those same techniques making Levy and Stott’s designs affordable, green, and efficient to build also enhance the houses’ fire resistance. Steel-framed modules that snap into standard shipping container-sized frames solve shipping challenges and make the houses nearly fireproof. The firm’s existing homes weathered the most recent round of fires.

“Almost all of our existing clients ended up having fire on or close to their sites—which is kind of terrifying, really—but none of them burned,” says Stott. “Often, an ember blows on the roof and the air draw from an attic starts the fire, but there are no attic spaces in our houses and rarely overhanging eves. Also, we build using steel assembly, so no place for fire to ignite really.”

Other materials used to finish exteriors and interiors also boast nonflammable characteristics. As Stott succinctly puts it, “Modern homes look good in aggressively fireproof materials.”

Connect Homes offers all plans in a metal exterior cladding with a resin-based coating—another difficult to burn material. If a client prefers natural wood instead of—or as an accent—to the metal, Levy and Stott use only spec thick , low-combustible cedar that’s slow to ignite and increases fire resistance. Decks are also made from cedar and rest on the ground, so there’s a lack of flame-feeding airflow beneath them.

Inside, homeowners choose from engineered wood and tile for floors and walls. Countertops are almost exclusively done in quartz. Such smooth finishes, combined with open floor plans, clean lines, and abundant glass fit Levy and Stott’s architectural values. The uncluttered style of design also deters leaping flames.

“We use less trim or connections or complicated shapes,” Stott explains, “so the possibility of embers jumping onto a small piece of molding just doesn’t happen.”

In addition to the inherent lack of combustibility in their modular, modern houses, Connect Homes can add more purposeful fire protection. California already mandates various fire resistant-rated materials depending on the location of the house, but Stott says they give all homeowners—even those in low-risk areas—the option of adding more fire resistance.

“We offer clients a layer of DensGlass,” he adds, “which is a gypsum product often required in high-fire areas.” The fiberglass sheathing, built by Georgia-Pacific, clads the home’s exterior to add increased fire resistance.

Stott also reasons that potential homeowners who approach Connect Homes already want the minimalist aesthetic the company supplies. This sensibility usually extends to landscaping, so most of their sites are similarly void of flammable ornamentation. At least in the area directly surrounding the structure. The company orients each house to best fit existing natural surroundings, which Stott believes makes the concept of designing and selling houses as products feasible for people who want their one-of-a-kind dream homes.

“The reason this works,” the architect explains, “is that every client comes to you with their program and site. A lot of houses share the same program, but no two houses share the same site. So even if the programs are all the same for our houses, each built version is unique.”

While each model Levy and Stott have designed follow a similar footprint, their approach offers clients savings from efficiencies in building identical components over and over, as well as a worry-free building timeline impervious to weather delays or unpredictable subcontractors. Plus, the end result is a precisely put together house with greater durability, energy-efficiency, and air tightness.

“We’ve enjoyed figuring out the great challenge of maintaining a beautiful aesthetic while designing a smarter, better prefab system,” Stott says. “And we felt strongly we wanted to give even more value to homeowners who experienced this terrible event. It feels so good for us to build them a high-design, quality house and save them the agony of labor shortages and other issues after the fires.”

But these events usually come with a pretty high cost of admission, putting them out of reach for most of us. Should gathering to celebrate health and wellness be reserved for only the elite?

Absolutely not, says award-winning singer-songwriter Jewel. Having been homeless as a young adult, she knows the challenge of trying to manage mental health and stay well when money’s tight.

That’s why Jewel has teamed up with Kroger, America’s largest supermarket chain, to create the Wellness Your Way Festival (Oct. 4-7). With day passes starting at just $15, the wellness festival in Cincinnati keeps things affordable, without sacrificing any of the incredible experiences you might find at other events. Now that’s a wellness win.

Here, Jewel gives the inside scoop the event, shares how she coped with panic attacks and anxiety while living in her car, and explains why coming together as a community is essential for healthy, happy lives.

Tell us about the Wellness Your Way Festival. What can attendees expect to see and experience at the event?

Jewel: People will experience a combination of my passions: health, wellness and music. They’ll hear from the coolest people and experts who have spent a lifetime seeking wisdom on how to live a healthier and happier life.

This festival will deliver meaningful tools and solutions to live mindfully. It’s pretty unique having traditional health and wellness professionals come together with holistic health experts, musicians and artists to make happiness and health more understandable, affordable and inspirational.

Having big businesses come together to use their resources, expertise and assets to make meaningful change in the areas of health and wellness is an incredible step toward solving this important societal challenge. The festival will offer an immersive experience that introduces people to the powerful initiatives Kroger has in place to help them [adopt] a healthy lifestyle, including the store’s Wellness Your Way initiative, the OptUP app (which tells people about better-for-you products) and the impressive Zero Hunger Zero Waste initiative.

I also hope to share a song or two from my new album that’s not out yet, which focuses on the pursuit of wisdom and how we can increase connection with ourselves and others.

Why is it notable that a company as large as Kroger is partnering with you on such an influential event?

Jewel: I believe we all have a duty to lift up our fellow man and woman, and large companies can play a tremendous role in making a difference in people’s lives. The companies that will do the best in the coming years will be sonically conscious and transparent with their customer. More than a slogan, they need to walk their talk—and many companies are willing to do this. It shows how far we’ve come as a society and what our next generation of leaders has to offer.

What’s your personal connection to wellness? How did that inspire you to co-found the Wellness Your Way Festival?

Jewel: I grew up on a homestead in Alaska, with no electricity or running water. We had to hunt and grow our own food—all in a short time before the harsh winters. We ate well, carried in clean water from the creek, worked hard, lived close to the land and stayed physically healthy.

But mentally and emotionally, it was another story. My mom left when I was 8, my dad had post-traumatic stress disorder from an abusive childhood and Vietnam and drank to medicate his trauma. I inherited the emotional language of abuse and neglect that had been passed down for generations. I wanted to break that cycle and I moved out at 15, knowing the odds were against me.

When a boss fired me at age 18 for not having sex with him, I lived in my car. Then my car was stolen and I was homeless. I was having panic attacks and became agoraphobic. I was also suffering from chronic kidney problems and nearly died of sepsis when a hospital turned me away because I didn't have insurance. Luckily, a doctor found me in the parking lot and gave me lifesaving antibiotics.

I was stealing to survive, and one day I looked in the mirror of a store I was shoplifting from and saw what I looked like: a homeless kid who was just another statistic. I remembered the quote, “Happiness does not depend on who you are or what you have, it depends on what you think.” I decided to turn my life around, one thought at a time. And that was when I began to develop a series of exercises that would change my life and rewire my brain. I now share them for free as part of my nonprofit Never Broken.

I had to learn to advocate for my wellness and learn how to eat, what herbs to take to build health, how to manage anxiety and panic attacks and ultimately which habits would lead to happiness. I didn't want to be a human full of holes, I wanted to be a whole human.

Wow, that’s such an inspiring story. Just like you had experienced, many others today are completely excluded from health and wellness because it can be so expensive. Why did you decide to keep the price of your festival so low?

Jewel: Having been homeless, I know how many people are one paycheck away from being on the street. I had to find tools that worked for me, for free.

Wellness should not be for only the rich—it’s a human right. There is so much in health care that is affordable and doable that can make a huge difference in people’s lives, and I want to share that information with everyone, not just those who can afford it. Everyone deserves the opportunity to thrive and be happy.

So much of wellness culture focuses on the self. Yet, Wellness Your Way will bring people together into community. Why is community important when it comes to self-care?

Jewel: We live in an age that is paradoxical—we seem more connected than ever through our devices, and yet we are more disconnected [from each other]. So in my work, I have made a promise to create opportunities for connection and offer tools to help people have more satisfying relationships with themselves, their families and their communities.

As individuals and as a society, we need to reconnect with ourselves, apart from all the distractions, and by doing so reconnect more deeply with our community. We need opportunities to connect, and what better way than at an event with music and speakers.

I’ve been inspired by the communities we’ve created through the Never Broken program, the Inspiring Children Foundation and through my fan base. The Wellness Your Way Festival is a chance to do even more in person. It’s incredible the way the youth in my foundation share their stories and struggles with one another, give advice and support each other. The number one thing our society needs right now is genuine connection to self, and, in turn, others.

What kind of practices can people expect to take home from the Wellness Your Way Festival and use in their everyday lives?

Jewel: People will learn about nutrition, sleep patterns, how our brains form habits and how to build better habits. They’ll learn what mindfulness is, how to do it (it's easy!) and how to do exercises that can help reduce anxiety.

Attendees will also be inspired by music and connections to their community. I hope they realize we are not alone in our lives—others struggle with the same things, and we can share common ground and tools to overcome them. It’s always a special time when people come together with the intention of improving themselves and helping others to do the same.

The simple wisdom we hope to share can inspire attendees to experience a deeper connection with themselves and others. Happiness is a science, an algorithm you can learn. It’s a lot simpler than you might think.","That’s why Jewel has teamed up with Kroger, America’s largest supermarket chain, to create the Wellness Your Way Festival (Oct. 4-7).

Frank And Oak

Sustainable clothing startup Frank And Oak just released a new collection of denim for men and women.

By teaming up with Hydro-Less Laundry, Frank And Oak's jeans use 79% less energy, 50% fewer chemicals, and 95% less water than traditional manufacturing techniques.

We put the jeans to the test and were extremely pleased with the quality, fit, and available washes.

Now through September 14, you can save $10 on Frank And Oak denim by using the promo code ""DENIM10"" at checkout.

Denim is by far one of the most wasteful materials to produce across the entire apparel industry. Between growing the cotton used to make the clothes and achieving those fashionable washes in the final stages of production, the process uses a lot more water than you could imagine — not to mention a load of chemicals.

Considering that jeans are a staple in pretty much everyone's wardrobe, it can seem as if there's no end in sight to the wasteful production of denim — but sustainable clothing startup Frank And Oak is making an effort to change that with its ""Hydro-Less"" denim.

Frank And Oak

The company uses high-quality materials that are sustainably-harvested or recycled, and manufacturing processes that minimize their impact on the planet. By teaming up with Hydro-Less Laundry, an eco-certified facility in Dubai that specializes in sustainable denim products, Frank And Oak's denim uses 79% less energy, 50% fewer chemicals, and most notably, 95% less water than traditional manufacturing techniques. Compared to standard processes that waste thousands of gallons of water, Hydro-Less' factory utilizes nano-bubble and Ozone-wash technologies to drastically improve water conservation.

When Frank And Oak launched a collection of denim last year, it sold out in one month and generated a lengthy list of customers eagerly waiting for a restock. Now, the brand is launching an even bigger collection just in time for fall — one that you can both feel good in and feel good about.

The new Frank And Oak denim collection consists of five men's fits and six women's fits, all of which are available in a variety of washes. Regardless of the fit or wash, Frank And Oak's Hydro-Less jeans are all priced at $79.50, but now through September 14, you can save $10 on them by using the promo code ""DENIM10"" at checkout. The promotion brings their already affordable jeans down to $69.50.

Here at Insider Picks, we've become big fans of Frank And Oak's minimalistic style and affordable subscription-based Style Plan, so we were excited to try out the denim collection.

119,https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2018/8/22/17-affordable-concealed-carry-guns-under-300/,"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Shooting Illustrated,17 Affordable Concealed-Carry Guns Under $300,"by Evan Brune - Wednesday, August 22, 2018

Following on the success of our previous affordable firearm roundup, where we focused on 10 AR-15s found for sale under $500, here’s a look at another hot segment of the market: concealed-carry guns.



With a growing number of concealed-carry permit holders in the country, the demand for personal-defense pistols continues to rise, and manufacturers across the world are stepping up to fill orders. However, many of these models are potentially out of reach for many budget-minded consumers, and Shooting Illustrated often receives complaints that some of the guns we cover are far out of reach of the average firearm enthusiast.



Of course, that begs the question: what are the most-affordable guns for sale today aimed at the concealed-carry market? We set out with a goal of finding at least 10 guns that were being sold by multiple retailers under $300, but to our surprise, we found far more than that.



To address some of the criticisms aimed at our previous affordable roundup, we did things a little differently this time. Gone is the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, as many of them are significantly different than the market price for many of these guns, and that only serves to foster confusion. We also found models sold by at least three separate retailers online, and the street price is the average of those three sale prices rather than the lowest price found, since some of these prices may reflect one-off fire sales by a single company rather than a general market price.



So, without further ado, here are 17 of the most-affordable handguns available to consumers today, ranging from most to least expensive:



Charter Arms Undercover .38 Spl.

Street Price: $287.89



The ""most-expensive"" gun on our list is still easily affordable, averaging well under three bills. For that, consumers get a compact, five-shot revolver chambered in the popular .38 Spl. The gun is built entirely from stainless steel and features a two-inch barrel and a total empty weight of 16 ounces. This revolver is ideally suited for daily carry, thanks to a double-action-only mechanism that offers no exposed hammer spur to catch on clothing during a draw. For those who prefer single-action operation, a model with an exposed hammer spur can also be found at an easily affordable price.



Beretta Pico .380 ACP

Street Price: $278.33



Billed as the “thinnest concealed-carry gun on the market,” the Beretta Pico never took off as much as other .380-caliber carry guns on the market, and from the specs, it’s hard to see why. It’s certainly sized right, measuring only 5.1 inches long, 4 inches high and 0.725 inch wide. Capacity measures up to other popular options, holding six rounds of .380 ACP in a single-stack magazine. Built on a modular chassis and double-action-only operation, the Pico can be disassembled easily and is compatible with different grip options, thanks to a serialized chassis that sits inside the grip frame.



EAA Windicator .38 Spl.

Street Price: $274.91



European American Armory Corp. might be the importer of these affordable revolvers, but the guns themselves are actually produced in Germany by a company called Weihrauch. Built on a solid-steel frame, these six-shot revolvers can be had in .38 Spl. or .357 Mag., but it’s the .38 Spl. model that concerns us here, because these wheelguns are easily affordable. An exposed hammer spur allows for single-action or double-action shots, and models are available with either a 2- or 4-inch barrel. Overall length varies from 7 to 8.5 inches, height measures in at 5.5 inches and the cylinder is 1.5 inches wide. Due to the gun’s all-steel construction, it is on the heavier side at 30.4 ounces.



Ruger EC9s

Street Price: $261.33



Ruger makes an early appearance in our budget-friendly list with a slightly larger concealed-carry gun chambered in a more-powerful cartridge than is found in the company’s popular LCP II, which can be found a bit further down. Fans of the LC9s might recognize the company’s EC9s, and that’s because it’s essentially the same gun. However, in an effort to make this single-stack self-defense gun more accessible, Ruger streamlined aspects of its production process, making this concealed-carry pistol more affordable than ever before. The EC9s features a striker-fired action and is built on a glass-filled nylon frame with an alloy-steel slide and barrel. Overall length measures in at 6 inches, height is 4.5 inches and the gun measures 0.90 inch wide. Total weight, unloaded, is 17.2 ounces.



Kahr Arms CT380 .380 ACP

Street Price: $256.78



Many Kahr Arms concealed-carry pistols have been priced at the upper end of the market, making the unique features of this platform unavailable to budget-minded buyers. However, in recent years, the company listened to the market and rolled out several budget-priced models, like the CT380. This is a single-stack design with double-action-only operation and a locked-breech action. One of the stand-out features of the CT380 is its small, thin size, measuring just 5.52 inches long, 4.4 inches high and 0.75 inch wide. Unloaded, the gun weighs just 11.44 ounces.



Bersa Thunder .380 ACP

Street Price: $256.06



Built in Argentina, the Thunder 380 is the best-selling imported gun produced by Bersa, and its affordable price is only one reason why it’s popular among American shooters. The gun is built on an alloy frame and features styling similar to the famous Walther PPK. The action is also PPK-like, since the gun has a built-in decocker that enables a long, double-action trigger pull for the first shot and short, crisp, single-action pulls for the remaining rounds in the magazine. The Bersa Thunder 380 is a single-stack design with a magazine capacity of seven rounds. Overall length measures 6.6 inches, height is 4.7 inches and width is 1.3 inches. Total weight of the all-metal gun comes in at 20 ounces.



Ruger LCP II .380 ACP

Street Price: $254.61



Ruger’s popular LCP pocket pistol received an update in recent years, with enhanced texturing, more-prominent sights and a crisp, single-action trigger that made accurate shots a breeze. Of course, the company’s original LCP is still being sold as a budget alternative, but for the price, the added benefits of the LCP II are a must-have. Built on a glass-filled nylon frame, the gun measures 5.17 inches long, 3.71 inches high and 0.91 inch wide. Total weight is 10.6 ounces and magazine capacity is six rounds.



Remington RM380 .380 ACP

Street Price: $241.04



Based on Shooting Illustrated’s own 1,000-round test, editors concluded that the RM380 was a pocket pistol with an atrocious trigger pull but was otherwise a reliable, dependable pocket pistol for personal defense. The gun is made entirely from metal, featuring an anodized-aluminum frame paired with a stainless-steel slide. The gun is equipped with a hammer-fired operating system paired with a double-action-only trigger with a pull weight of more than 9 pounds. Size-wise, the gun measures 5.27 inches long, 3.86 inches high and 0.95 inch wide. Magazine capacity is six rounds.



Taurus Spectrum .380 ACP

Street Price: $230.56



One of the latest .380 ACP pocket pistols introduced in recent years is the Taurus Spectrum. This unique platform is equipped with soft, polymer touch pads that provide gripping surface and recoil absorption and, as an added bonus, can be had in a range of different colors for a unique, custom look. The gun itself is built on a polymer frame paired with a steel slide and features a magazine capacity of 7 rounds. The overall size of the gun is 5.4 inches long, 3.82 inches high and 0.89 inch wide. Total weight comes in at 10 ounces.



Taurus G2C 9 mm

Street Price: $206.37



Based on the company’s popular Millennium G2, the Taurus G2C is a compact, carry-size variant built with a double-stack magazine and a striker-fired operating system. This budget-priced pistol is outfitted with a manual safety and a total capacity of 12 + 1. Barrel length, like the original Millennium G2, measures in at 3.25 inches, and the overall length of the gun is 6.25 inches. Height and width measure in at 5 inches and 1.25 inches, respectively, and the total weight, unloaded, is 21.15 ounces.



SCCY CPX-2 9 mm

Street Price: $205.33



One of the more well-known budget pistols on the market today is the SCCY CPX-2, which is constructed with an aluminum-alloy receiver set inside of a grip frame molded from Zytel polymer. The gun is built with a double-action-only, hammer-fired operating system complete with a 9-pound trigger pull. This particular gun is one of only a couple double-stack 9 mms to appear on our list, but that doesn’t stop it from being easily concealable. The pistol measures 6 inches long, 4.2 inches high and weighs only 15 ounces unloaded.



North American Arms Mini Revolver .22 Mag.

Street Price: $205.32



While the North American Arms line of Mini Revolvers aren’t necessarily a go-to choice as a primary defensive arm, they can serve admirably in a backup role as SI Contributor Dick Williams wrote of his collection of NAA guns. The .22 Mag. options are also affordable and can pack a punch above that of the more-anemic .22 LR chambering found elsewhere in the company’s lineup. One drawback is the cartridge’s rimfire ignition, which makes it inherently less reliable than centerfire rounds. The NAA .22 Mag. definitely has size on its side, measuring only 4.63 inches long, 2.81 inches high and weighing 6.2 ounces.



Diamondback DB380 .380 ACP

Street Price: $203.44



Built on a polymer frame, the Diamondback DB380 includes some unique mechanical features that make it stand out, including the company’s ZERO-Energy striker system that features a mechanical firing-pin block to protect against unintentional discharges. The internals in the gun are treated with a special coating that resists corrosion, making this pistol durable enough to withstand daily carry use. The DB380 measures 5.26 inches long, 3.75 inches high and weighs only 8.8 ounces unloaded. Magazine capacity is 6 rounds.



Kel-Tec P32 .32 ACP

Street Price: $202.51



Kel-Tec has always brought unique, interesting concepts to market and one that certainly fills that criteria is its P-32, which is one of the lightest, smallest and indeed most-affordable concealed-carry guns available today. Measuring just 5.1 inches long, 3.5 inches high and 0.75-inch wide, the P32 weighs in at an incredibly low 6.6 ounces unloaded. The single-stack magazine holds seven rounds, and the gun is built with a double-action only operation.



Hi-Point C-9 9 mm

Street Price: $148.58



Say what you will about Hi-Point handguns, but they’re built for those who can afford nothing else, and they’ll run. Of course, many will look at the clunky, zinc-alloy slide and question whether or not the C-9 can really be considered a viable concealed-carry gun, but a simple survey of available holster fits for the C-9 shows that it can be carried. Built on a polymer frame, the Hi-Point C-9 features a 3.5-inch barrel and measures in at an overall length of 6.75 inches. Overall weight is on the heavier side at 29 ounces, but for less than $150, you aren’t going to get everything.



Phoenix Arms HP25A .25 ACP

Street Price: $136.62



Another entry into the category of budget-built defensive guns is the Phoenix Arms HP25A. Technically, this isn’t the least-expensive Phoenix Arms on the market. That honor belongs to the company’s HP22A, chambered in .22 LR. However, the centerfire .25 ACP is more reliable than the rimfire .22. The small size of the cartridge does mean that it has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds, and barrel length measures 3 inches. Built on an alloy frame, the overall weight of the gun is 20 ounces. All these features, along with its low price, certainly place it in the marketplace of low-priced, concealed-carry guns, but spending a few more bucks will put consumers in a better position.



Cobra Denali .380 ACP

Street Price: $127.23



Covered by many as the least-expensive handgun in America, the Denali is undeniably designed for concealed-carry use, thanks to its tiny dimensions and carry-sized cartridge. The gun is equipped with a five-round, single-stack magazine that’s locked into place by a unique, push-button magazine release located on the rear edge of the grip rather than near the trigger guard. Barrel length is 2.8 inches, and the gun weighs in at just 17 ounces, thanks to a polymer frame. While the Denali may not be the best choice for a concealed-carry gun, it certainly is affordable, so it makes our list.



Those aggressive deal-seekers among our readers might note that this list isn’t entirely comprehensive, and in many ways, it can’t be. Between fluctuating market prices, manufacturer-sponsored rebates and distributor deals, there are always different options within this range. However, this list is a summer snapshot of what kinds of handguns will typically fall under our $300 budget ceiling. As with any handgun anyone counts on for personal defense, consumers should always test their firearm for reliability and function before depending on it as a life-saving tool.","by Evan Brune - Wednesday, August 22, 2018Following on the success of our previous affordable firearm roundup, where we focused on 10 AR-15s found for sale under $500, here’s a look at another hot segment of the market: concealed-carry guns.

Today, the AIA released a statement voicing the Institute's ""strong opposition"" to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE Rule). Announced on Aug. 21, this rule would set new guidelines for states developing standards for greenhouse gas emissions related to their remaining coal-fired power plants. If enacted, the ACE Rule would empower states to relax pollution standards, according to a Washington Post article.

The EPA will take comments up to 60 days after the initial rule announcement and will hold a public hearing on Oct. 1 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Ralph Metcalfe Federal Building in Chicago.

AIA 2018 president Carl Elefante, FAIA, filed the following statement to EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler on Sept. 6:

The AIA is firmly and unequivocally opposed to the EPA proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule. We believe that, if enacted, the proposed, Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units, will be detrimental to the health of all Americans and will greatly undermine the fight against global warming.

For 160 years, the AIA has worked to advance the quality of life of all Americans and protect the public’s health, safety and welfare. The AIA’s 90,000 members work every day to advance our nation's built environment through design. From designing the next generation of energy-saving buildings to promoting equitable and livable neighborhoods and making our communities healthier and safer, architects play a central role in influencing and improving public health through their work.



This obligation to safeguard public health is most apparent in our efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by building energy use. This administration’s proposal to roll back the Clean Power Plan is moving the United States in the opposite direction of the protection afforded under the plan. It will directly impede the ability of our members to meet their professional obligations.

The AIA also challenges the EPA’s assertion that this proposed rule would create ""more jobs’"" A 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Energy shows that clean energy jobs far surpass those in the fossil fuel industry. In sum, the study states that, ""nearly 1 million Americans are working near- or full-time in the energy efficiency, solar, wind and alternative vehicles sector. This is almost five times the current employment in the fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas and oil workers.""

The EPA proposed rule is a not-so-thinly veiled attempt to overturn the Clean Power Plan. The rulemaking process set forth in the Clean Air Act guarantees that decisions affecting regulated parties and the public health and welfare will be made based upon a careful consideration of law, evidence and comments from the public. The agency’s commitment to full participation from all stakeholders affected by Clean Air Act rules has contributed to the Act’s remarkable success over almost 50 years of saving lives, protecting the nation’s natural resources, and contributing to a robust economy.

Please note AIA’s strong opposition to this proposed rule.

122,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pseg-follows-state-policy-for-a-new-era-of-affordable-clean-reliable-resilient-and-safe-energy-300720201.html,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",PR Newswire,"PSE&G Follows State Policy For A New Era of Affordable, Clean, Reliable, Resilient and Safe Energy","""PSE&G's proposed investments support New Jersey's clean energy goals, while putting our customers' needs at the forefront,"" said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Public Service Enterprise Group. ""The investments aim to keep bills lower than they were 10 years ago. In addition to providing safe, highly reliable service, utilities need to help their customers use less energy. This may be the only industry in America making a business case to sell you less of its product.""

The filing supports the state's progressive clean energy leadership and is consistent with the Clean Energy legislation recently signed into law by Governor Murphy, which requires utilities to reduce customers' annual electric and gas consumption by 2 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively.

""Helping our customers use energy more efficiently is the only way to simultaneously lower bills, clean the environment and create jobs,"" Izzo added.

The proposal will also put New Jersey on the path to meeting the aggressive energy storage goals set forth in the law, and supports the state's policy to bolster electric vehicles (EVs), make the electric grid more resilient, and improve storm restoration response. PSE&G shares the state's vision with respect to these important issues.

""Clean Energy Future is expected to save customers about $7.4 billion,"" said Dave Daly, PSE&G president and chief operating officer.

""The lion's share of the investments will provide our customers with access to energy savings opportunities from 22 energy efficiency programs. These programs alone are expected to produce $5.7 billion in savings for participating customers over the program's lifetime. Utilities can and should ensure that the benefits of energy efficiency are available to all customers, regardless of income. Energy efficiency will help customers use less energy, ensure the energy they use is cleaner and lower their monthly bills.""

If approved, CEF will build on PSE&G's momentum to modernize its utility infrastructure, save customers billions of dollars on their energy bills, improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, create thousands of jobs and have a multibillion-dollar impact on the local economy during the next 20 years.

CEF also includes a plan to implement an advanced technology platform, called the Energy Cloud, which would modernize the way the utility serves customers in the future. When fully implemented, the Energy Cloud is expected to save customers another $1.7 billion over 20 years.

Investments and customer benefits

CEF represents a six-year commitment for energy efficiency, EVs, energy storage and the Energy Cloud program, which would create an advanced technology network and upgrade 2.2 million electric meters to smart meters.

CEF will introduce exciting new opportunities for customers including electric school buses, which are healthier for children, and smart meters, which provide real-time data and enable faster outage restoration. Businesses, such as hospitals, that have participated in PSE&G's energy efficiency programs to date have seen significant savings, up to $1.5 million a year. The programs will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 40 million tons over the lifetime of the programs, equivalent to removing about 380,000 cars annually by 2025, growing to about 800,000 cars annually by 2035.

""Clean Energy Future is a win-win-win for New Jersey,"" Daly said. ""It's aligned with what our customers want. It's aligned with the Governor's energy policy. And it benefits our state's economy.

""We have already heard from a diverse and growing list of New Jersey organizations that support the goals of PSE&G's Clean Energy Future programs,"" he added. ""So far, we have received support from more than 80 organizations from across New Jersey, representing environmental advocates, clean energy service providers, large and small businesses, labor organizations, elected officials, nonprofit agencies and community leaders…and more support is arriving every day.""

Energy Efficiency

The nearly $2.8 billion energy efficiency plan includes $2.5 billion of investment and $283 million in other program costs. It will allow customers to use up-front rebates and other financial incentives to purchase more efficient appliances, smart thermostats and other equipment; get free and affordable energy audits, reports and system design advice; get free and low-cost energy efficiency kits, tools and installations; and seed funding for new energy-saving techniques. The plan has a special emphasis on hard-to-reach customers, such as low-income, multi-family, small business and local governments. One program, for example, will upgrade municipal streetlights in PSE&G's service territory with LED lights.

Electric Vehicles

The $364 million EV program includes approximately $261 million of investment and $103 million in other program costs. The proposal jump-starts broader use of EVs by supporting nearly 40,000 EV chargers, the bulk of which are for residential use. It includes mixed-use and public DC fast-charging. CEF also supports EV innovation, including custom projects for airports, ports and other transit facilities and grants for school districts to buy and operate electric school buses.

Energy Storage

Energy storage provides more flexibility and efficiency in electric systems, makes it easier to integrate renewables and provides backup so there are fewer outages. The $180 million proposal includes approximately $109 million of investments and $71 million in other program costs. It calls for 35 megawatts of energy storage capacity over six years through five programs: solar smoothing, distribution deferral, mobile storage for outage management, microgrids for critical facilities and peak reduction for public sector facilities. CEF will begin to put New Jersey on track to meet the Clean Energy legislation's goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2,000 megawatts by 2030.

Energy Cloud

PSE&G's Energy Cloud will produce an estimated $1.7 billion in customer savings and operational benefits over 20 years, more than double the cost. The nearly $800 million program includes an investment of approximately $721 million and $73 million in other program costs. It improves reliability, improves customer service and reduces the carbon footprint. This major undertaking includes a plan to educate customers about the many benefits of smart meters. If approved, PSE&G intends to install the smart meters by 2024.

PSE&G CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE

New Jersey has the opportunity to be at the forefront of clean energy policy and a role model for the nation. Governor Murphy's progressive goals have opened the door for utilities, energy/environmental organizations and corporations to work together to develop, support and invest in transformative clean energy solutions.

As a first step, PSE&G has outlined its vision for a Clean Energy Future, with proposed programs that will help meet the growing consumer desires to use less energy, to ensure the energy they use is cleaner, and to lower their bills by managing the energy they use. If we are successful, we can save money for customers, create well-paying jobs for the people who will implement these programs, create wider use of clean energy sources and more economic growth.

However, we need to work together across the state with both public and private entities to make this a reality and advance Governor Murphy's energy and environmental goals. The following organizations and individuals are supportive of PSE&G's clean energy vision and directive reflective of the proposed wide-ranging blueprint for the future of energy in New Jersey.

123,https://news.psu.edu/story/537471/2018/09/20/sustainability/project-provide-reliable-and-affordable-solar-generated,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Penn State News,Project to provide reliable and affordable solar-generated energy to Penn State,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A new project will provide 2,500 megawatt-hours of clean, reliable and affordable solar-generated energy annually to the University as part of its diversified energy portfolio. The Penn State Office of Physical Plant and Alternative Energy Development Group (AEDG) announced Sept. 19 the development of a 2 megawatt Advanced Utility-Scale Solar photovoltaic system.

“The Office of Physical Plant is thrilled to be part of yet another project that will provide clean, reliable and sustainable energy to the University,” said Steve Maruszewski, assistant vice president of the Office of Physical Plant and the lead Penn State project sponsor. “This installation provides the University with the ability to research and optimize multiple power generation sources on our micro-grid. It is a true living lab project that combines operations directly with teaching, research and outreach.”

Providing education and research — and electricity

The solar project will provide 1 percent of University Park’s campus electricity needs. Included in the project will be an educational kiosk supporting academic instruction and research, sharing real-time performance data of the array. In addition, the array also will offer Penn State opportunities to test future technological developments in the field.

“We see the new solar farm as an incredible opportunity to understand the impacts of solar development on landscapes and ecosystems, as well as for power production,” said Jeffrey Brownson, associate professor of Energy and Mineral Engineering in the Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering. “We have already begun involving student research and classes in the framework for this systems-based solar integration, called ‘solar ecology.' Students are also excited to integrate our open-source sunlight monitoring techniques using Penn State 3D printing.”

Guiding the solar project’s development are specific goals and objectives, including:

Establishing a significant and visible onsite solar photovoltaic project site.

Balancing economics, social benefits and environmental impact of solar energy projects.

Advancing research and grant development opportunities.

Creating a large-scale, micro-grid, living lab opportunity.

Partnering to produce reliable and sustainable energy

The array was developed by AEDG, a Pennsylvania-based renewable energy developer, and will be financed, owned, maintained and operated by AEDG and MVE Capital Inc., an affiliate of the MVE Group Inc., in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. The University has entered into a 25-year, solar-power purchase agreement to purchase 100 percent of the electricity and PA Alternative Energy Credits generated by the solar system for the term of the agreement.

“This is an opportunity to further our pursuit of our energy savings goals, provide our students and researchers with a living lab opportunity close to their classrooms and laboratories, and continue exploring ways to lessen our impact on the environment.” — David Gray, senior vice president of Finance and Business

The solar project is an example of a public-private partnership, including the following parties:

Penn State, the project sponsor and beneficiary of the clean/renewable power provided by the solar system; and educational participation in the feasibility, design, implementation and optimization of the system.

Alternative Energy Development Group, a Berwyn, Pennsylvania, firm, is the project’s lead developer and co-financial owner and operator.

MVE Capital Inc. is the project’s co-financial owner and operator, along with Meadow Valley Electric Inc., the project's general construction and electrical contracting provider.

“We want to thank and recognize the cross-functional team from Penn State, West Penn Power, West Penn Power Sustainable Energy Fund, and all the Pennsylvania-based professional services firms who came together from a diverse range of stakeholder perspectives to make this project a reality,” said Chris D. Fraga, founder and CEO of AEDG. “Throughout the development process, we focused on Penn State’s stakeholder needs, while ensuring a design that would yield safety, performance and value from the state-of-the-art, utility-scale solar project. Integrating Penn State’s faculty, staff and students in the process was both enriching for all and builds upon Penn State’s energy strategy and we are honored to be part of this exciting Pennsylvania project.”

Expanding Penn State's solar footprint

This is not the first solar project the University has supported or sponsored. OPP, with the help of students and a $75,000 grant from the Sustainability Institute’s Reinvention Fund, installed a solar array outside its main facility to provide power to charge its 100 percent electric vehicles. The MorningStar Solar Home, located in the Sustainability Experience Center, was built in 2007 and is a 100 percent renewable energy powered home. It is used by teachers and faculty as an immersive learning destination. In addition, the Penn State Class of 2015’s gift was a solar panel array powering a bus stop near Beaver Stadium.","UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A new project will provide 2,500 megawatt-hours of clean, reliable and affordable solar-generated energy annually to the University as part of its diversified energy portfolio.

The SmartFlower is a special type of solar panel array designed to open into the shape of a flower in the morning and generate electricity by following the sun across the sky during the day, like its namesake.

Its design makes it the perfect solar array for an urban area where space is tight, and that's why it has become one of the first community solar projects to be installed in Illinois since the Future Energy Jobs Act in 2016 called for 400 megawatts worth of community solar installations by 2030, Energy News Network reported Wednesday.

The SmartFlower was installed in the vegetable garden of an affordable-housing complex run by The Renaissance Collaborative (TRC), which supplies affordable housing and job training to low-income communities in Chicago's South Side.

TRC Executive Director Patricia Abrams told Energy News Network that renewable energy projects like this one had a double benefit for community organizations looking to serve people economically.

""If you're going to deal with and provide services for the very low-income people, that means the government is picking up the tab,"" Abrams said. ""How do you—in the long haul—make that sustainable and affordable? Energy efficiency is one of those things I think is a must.""

Abrams told Energy News Network that the SmartFlower generated energy for the first time at a press conference in June, but has lain dormant throughout the rest of the summer as TRC waits for a full permit.

The TRC installation is the first in a partnership between community-solar developer Groundswell and the Mohawk Group, a flooring company dedicated to sustainability, to install 10 SmartFlowers in communities around the country within the next two years, Groundswell said.

The collaboration will save 3.3 kilowatt-hours of energy, enough to power 300 average U.S. homes.

For the Chicago installation, the groups also partnered with Elevate Energy, which is committed to expanding clean energy use to all who need it.

Elevate Energy Contractor Development Coordinator Eya Louis explained to Groundswell how the Chicago project also empowered the community to get involved with its own energy generation.

""We surveyed residents right away to see if there were any established electricians or carpenters or other tradespeople who could be a part of this project,"" Louis told Groundswell. ""Next, we offered training in solar installation with a local company. At our unveiling, we had our solar trainees there to witness some of what went into the installation. The instructor talked to them about the permitting process and will continue to work with them,"" she said.","The SmartFlower was installed in the vegetable garden of an affordable-housing complex run by The Renaissance Collaborative (TRC), which supplies affordable housing and job training to low-income communities in Chicago's South Side.

125,https://coloradosun.com/2018/09/20/used-electric-cars-colorado/,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Colorado Sun,"An electric car for under $10,000? Used EVs are a more affordable, but risky, new market","When Maria DiBiase Eisemann went to Tynan’s Nissan in Fort Collins to turn in her leased Nissan Leaf last fall, she left the dealership as owner of the same electric vehicle. But it wasn’t for her. It was for teenage daughter.

“It’s the greatest thing because it doesn’t go far, and she doesn’t have to buy gas,” said Eisemann, who happens to work for the Colorado Energy Office and actively promotes the benefit of electric vehicle ownership. “… The dealerships are starting to tell us we want to sell these used vehicles, and they’re very inexpensive (for as low as) $8,000 to $10,000.”

The Nissan Leaf, which started selling in 2010, is one of the most popular plug-in cars, partly because of a relatively low starting price of around $30,000 (Teslas are more in the $50,000 to $100,000 range). State and federal tax credits offer up to a $12,500 discount on a new car for Colorado buyers.

The credits have pushed down the price of used electric vehicles, and that has widened the appeal of environmentally conscious transport. While there are risks to buying any used vehicle, especially one of a technology less than a decade old, the state is counting on electric vehicles to become key in its goal to become a clean-energy leader.

“We’re looking into ways to break into low-income communities, multi-family housing units or urban centers and having a discussion,” said Eisemann, pointing to the state’s Charge Ahead program, which awarded 18 grants last spring to help communities install charging stations. “If you can’t charge an electric vehicle (at home or work), you won’t buy an electric vehicle.”

Affordability is an enticing factor to buy a used electric car. But there are risks with earlier models, said Eric Ibara, director of residual values for Kelley Blue Book, which helps consumers research and value cars.

Today’s electric cars can get 150 to 200 miles on a charge. But the earlier models lasted maybe 75 miles, causing “range anxiety” for drivers who dared not venture too far from a charging station. Most cars are also less than 10 years old. Nobody really knows how long the battery will last, or how well an older battery will keep its charge.

“My guess is that after five years, the cost of buying a new battery may exceed the value of the vehicle. You’re taking a risk buying a used electric vehicle,” Ibara said. “But while they retain a lower value over time, it’s a great buying opportunity for consumers.”

At car-buying site Autotrader.com recently, there were 21 used Leafs, all three years or older, for sale within 50 miles of Denver. Prices ranged from $8,486 to $14,999. Ten used Chevrolet Volts were priced between $12,494 and $19,203. For comparison, Tesla, an exception because they retain their value like gas vehicles, cars started at $39,900 for a 2013 Model S and topped out at $89,999 for a 2011 Roadster Sport.

During Denver’s Drive Electric Week last week, a parade of electric vehicles lined the curb in front of the City & County Building. Tesla’s, Chevy Volts, Nissan Leafs, a Fisker Karma and even a Tesla police car.

“That Nissan Leaf is a 2018 and is $38,000,” said Luke Walch, founder of Green Eyed Motors, a Boulder dealership specializing in used hybrids, electrics and other fuel-efficient vehicles. “We sell the same car, 3-years old, for about $14,000 to $15,000. They’re a very fast depreciating car.”

According to Kelley Blue Book, gas-engine cars typically retain about 40 percent of their value after three years. Electric vehicles, excluding Tesla’s, come in at 15 to 20 percent lower than gas models.

“We get all walks of life, anything from college students or a 16-year-old’s first car to people who commute quite far and want to save money to elderly people that are just sick of the maintenance involved with a gas car,” Walch said. “Electric vehicles have proven to be reliable.”

Most used electric cars are also still under the manufacturer’s warranty. Kia has a 10-year or 100,000-mile warranty no matter who owns it, said Joe Cross, value creation director for i25 Kia in Longmont.

“Electric vehicles are very expensive. You pay $3,000 to $6,000 more than its gas counterpart. In my personal opinion, I’m not sure the electric is worth that much more than gas because of how much it’ll take” to benefit in gas savings, Cross said. “But on the used side, you don’t have that big markup so it’s more in line with its gas counterpart. People tend to be OK with it. It’s more affordable, plus I’m going to save money.”

The fuel savings depend on the price of gas. According to Colorado Electric Vehicle Plan, an owner saves $54,468 over the life of the car thanks to fuel savings, reduced maintenance costs and emission benefits.

Danny Katz, with the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, calculates that an electric car’s fueling costs are about one-third the cost of gas. It takes 28 kilowatt hours (kWh) to drive 100 miles. At 12 cents per kWh, the cost is about $3.30 for 100 miles, he said.

“A 33 mpg car would take three gallons and cost about nine bucks. So it’s about one-third the cost (of gas),” said Katz, who was passing out toolkits at the Denver event to encourage local governments to make their towns more electric vehicle friendly.

In Colorado, the number of used electric vehicles is still very small. But it’s growing. According to the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles, the state had 9,012 registered electric vehicles as of July 31, a number that has tripled in four years. The number of charging stations built through the state’s Charge Ahead Colorado program is now at 685. And the state’s tax credit payouts to new electric vehicle buyers has doubled in since 2013.

Colorado Electric Vehicle Fund

Here’s the amount Colorado paid out of the state’s fund offering tax credits to buyers of new electric vehicle.

Year Innovate Motor Vehicle Credit 2012 $4,410,795 2013 $4,917,529 2014 $6,096,421 2015 $7,534,297 2016 $9,583,687

The state has encouraged buyers to go electric. Colorado in 2016 passed a law allowing buyers to save $5,000 at the time of purchase, as long as the lender handles the complex tax-credit paperwork. That first year, the state credited new EV owners $9.6 million, up from $7.5 million in 2015, according to the Department of Revenue.

Electric vehicles remain a fraction — 0.002 percent — of the nearly 6 million vehicles registered in the state.

Ibara, with Kelley Blue Book, believes the popularity of electric vehicles will continue to grow, and not just among buyers who don’t want their car contributing to pollution. Many of the electric cars sold in recent years were leased, so they’re coming back on the market as the leases expire. The used market is reaching a wider audience because of the lower price.

“My impression is that something north of 50 percent of the (electric) vehicles are being sold as leases. It might be more like 80 percent,” Ibara said. “We’ve actually seen an uptick in used electric vehicles at auction this year.”

CleanTechnica recently spoke with co-founder Julie Kronstrøm, who, along with her brother Christian Adel Michael, founded MATE two years ago. Their mission back then was to make an affordable, high-quality, well-designed e-bike that would make riding an electric bike an option for millions of people around the world.

Funded by the Crowd

They are back for their second act on IndieGoGo with the MATE X, which brings a ton of upgrades to a lightly polished version of same successful platform that they originally brought to the world. The core bike can still be purchased by itself — or customers can add on a number of options that let customers build up a custom bike for their lifestyle. On the back end, MATE has been hard at work to give the company a tune-up to ensure they are able to keep costs low as they scale up operations while delivering at the same quality that early riders came to love.

The campaign has already raised an impressive $11.7 million, which clearly takes what the team can do, and must do, to the next level. Julie shared that, “crowdfunding was one of the ways we were able to make it affordable at such a low price,” noting that the model allowed them to not only share their product directly with customers but to talk with them along the way.

Effectively engaging customers in the process turned customers into brand advocates and was one of the ways they built such a strong brand in such a short time, according to Julie. “It’s more or less one to one with crowdfunding,” which the team at MATE have demonstrated can be leveraged as a huge advantage when done well.

The Next Generation

The dynamic duo at MATE were excited to bring the second-generation of MATE to IndieGoGo because they were inspired by the feedback they had received through the campaign for the first-generation MATE bike. They were firmly committed to the idea of bringing a well-designed, affordable e-bike to the world, and the first-generation MATE demonstrated that there was demand. Also, along the way, they identified opportunities to improve upon the platform with add-ons as simple as fenders and lights. Julie shared that in the second campaign, they are looking to “give people the choice to make the upgrades they want.”

The new MATE X does add a few subtle base upgrades that Julie believes will boost the experience for riders in meaningful ways, including a performance boost that translates to a voltage boost that has been “increased from 36V to 48V, which means you get a much more powerful bike with more torque.” E-bikes are a lot like electric cars in that when you ride one, you just get it.

Julie shared that this is something they have seen at all levels. “Even those bike fanatics, when they get on an e-bike, they understand.” E-bikes enable bikers to ride for longer, faster, and even when they aren’t in shape. It’s a transformative experience that opens up the possibility of commuting and long-range biking to even more people. That lets people get in shape while getting the planet back in shape by cutting emissions at the same time. That’s a beautiful thing, whether it happens on a MATE bike or not.

Inspired to Change the World

MATE sprung out of some late-night ideation sessions between Julie and Christian. Julie was bored with the mundanity of life and out of the deep conversations with her brother they decided to take the plunge together, though Julie shared it was Christian who was the catalyst for taking the plunge. Their hard work, late nights, and the work they’ve done resulted in the MATE eBike.

Most importantly, the MATE has not only served as an inspiration for the establishment of the company, it has also inspired MATE customers around the world. Julie shared that they have shipped MATE bikes all over the world, including a few to exotic locales like Kazakhstan, where they shipped 4 MATE bikes. “I think we were just really surprised that it was so many countries,” Julie shared.

“We had some guy from Lima [Peru] riding and it was so inspiring to him that he wanted to change the whole traffic situation in Lima.” One of the beautiful things about promising new technologies is how they serve as a platform that opens up new possibilities for customers. E-bikes are certainly that, as MATE bikes are but a single example of how bike riders new to motors and batteries get on and take them out for a spin.

Julie shared that, “for me, it has been rewarding to see the impact we’re making on a single person.” That impact is being realized around the world by many more people in this second round of MATE bikes as the campaign soars to heights they had never dreamed of.

MATE X: Round Two

Don’t read this and get the impression that it’s all been a path covered in rose petals and champagne. Speaking with Julie, it was clear that the process of learning how to design a product for manufacturing, line up partners at all levels of the company — ranging from manufacturing to shipping and customer service — have all been challenges that have pushed the team to the brink.

Julie shared that, “we like to work together with people for a long time.” Building a company that’s not just filled with people, but that is filled with people who work together is key. “Making good relationships work,” is how Julie put it, but it really just shows how focused she is on building products and a company that works for people. “We let people shine around us,” she shared. And that’s amazing.

On the other hand, the experience has been extremely rewarding as they’ve built a team of people who now feel like family and that they can rally to overcome newer, larger challenges. Shipping has been one of the challenges for MATE, as the size of the LG or Samsung battery packs they use make all MATE eBike shipments “class 9 dangerous goods.” Not only that, but any container shipment containing a MATE e-bike is classified in its entirety as dangerous goods, which comes with its own set of increased rules and regulations.

This isn’t a MATE issue, but something that applies to all sorts of personal electric vehicles, including electric skateboards, scooters, e-bikes, and the like. “I really hope that the people working with these technologies can make them safer and easier to transport,” Julie shared. The good news is that with the volume of shipments steadily ramping up around the world and the continuous work to improve battery tech, it’s all but a certainty that the situation will improve over time. Until then, it’s one more item on the list of things to keep plugging away at for the team at MATE.

What’s Next?

As for the dreamers, Christian continues to push the design of the MATE e-bike forward, with plans for a carbon fiber bike and smaller tweaks to the platform that they believe will allow them to reach more and more customers around the world. Yeah, not everyone needs a carbon fiber e-bike, but there are plenty of hardcore bikers around the world who would gladly pay a few hundred or thousand dollars more for a folding e-bike that was a few pounds lighter.

Features like carbon fiber frames and premium components are clearly not going to make their way into the baseline offering any time soon, but there are other bolt-ons that they’re looking at that they believe will help their customers even more. “There are many things you can do to improve the product, but then the price would be different.”

It’s onward and upward for the team at MATE as they continue to pave the road in front of them as they move forward while working hard at not taking themselves too seriously. Julie shared that, “it needs to be fun and relaxed,” and that part of the key to building a business where they actually want to work is “getting people’s input on what they like and not being too self-serious.” I think the unicorn paint job speaks loudly to this point, and while pink is not my color, it’s so ridiculous that it kind of actually makes me want to ride a pink (and green) bike.

127,https://www.geekwire.com/2018/helping-defeat-tax-affordable-housing-paul-allen-jeff-bezos-step-homelessness/,"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GeekWire,"After helping defeat a tax for affordable housing, Paul Allen and Jeff Bezos step up on homelessness","On a crisp fall Tuesday in Seattle, representatives from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s philanthropic organization joined with community groups to break ground on a new homeless resource center to house up to 94 families in the shadow of a new light rail line in the city.

The Mount Baker Family Housing & Resource Center will combine permanent housing for homeless and low-income families with transitional housing and community resources.

Paul G. Allen Philanthropies donated $30 million to get the project off the ground, supplemented by an additional $15 million from the Seattle Office of Housing and a tax credit. It’s the latest investment by a wealthy tech executive targeting the homelessness crisis as the business community faces growing pressure to ease the pain of the region’s growth.

The tech industry is one of the major drivers of Seattle’s population boom and rising housing costs, creating a complicated dynamic where one of the nation’s most prosperous cities struggles to house and support its most vulnerable people. Tensions escalated earlier this year when the Seattle City Council passed, then quickly repealed, a tax on large businesses to raise funds for affordable housing. The city capitulated in the face of pressure from the tech industry and the broader electorate.

Allen contributed substantially more to the Mount Baker Family Housing foundation than the $25,000 his investment firm, Vulcan, donated to the campaign to kill the controversial “head tax.”

As Vulcan fought the head tax, Allen’s organizations were working on other projects to serve homeless people in Seattle. Vulcan employees and other volunteers spent a day building tiny homes for a new homeless shelter village in Seattle’s Central District. Vulcan donated $75,000 to that project. Planning for the Mt. Baker center was also underway as the head tax battle took place.

In an interview with GeekWire, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said the project is a sign that “people are willing to work with each other.”

“What we’ve been able to do now is, hopefully, remove some of the fights and get to solutions,” she said.

The Mt. Baker development is the result of two years of study by Allen’s team, according to Bill Rumpf, president of Mercy Housing Northwest, one of the project’s nonprofit partners.

What we’ve been able to do now is, hopefully, remove some of the fights and get to solutions.

“This is the first time I’ve personally experienced what happens when Paul Allen studies something and wants to get big results,” Rumpf told the crowd that gathered for the groundbreaking. “Mt. Baker Housing represents the power of significant philanthropy from a leader in our business community and the importance of collaboration with the city. It’s going to take all of us to resolve the homeless crisis.”

Mercy Housing Northwest and the City of Seattle partnered with Paul G. Allen Philanthropies on the Mt. Baker development. The vision is to create a hub for family services and resources that serves the broader community, not just people experiencing homelessness.

“I’m hoping that this serves as a model for a number of other philanthropists and businesses,” Durkan said.

Last week, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced a $2 billion charitable fund to go toward nonprofits supporting homeless families and building a network of tuition-free preschools.

Like Vulcan, Amazon donated $25,000 to the campaign to repeal the short-lived head tax. The company also threatened to slow or stop its growth in Seattle if the tax took effect, making it the poster child for tech industry opposition to the city’s affordable housing plan. When the tax was defeated, Amazon and others in the business community pledged to help find solutions to Seattle’s housing crisis.

Durkan said it’s imperative to “harness that power of new technology and the people working in new technology” to address Seattle’s housing crisis.

“It’s not just, ‘should Jeff Bezos and Amazon do more,’ ” she said. “But they have 50,000 workers in Seattle who want to do more and are volunteering and helping. We’ve got to harness that energy in a more systematic fashion too because if you look at the power behind that group of workers, they can do more for the community and they can do more for those workers who aren’t getting paid as well.”

The Mt. Baker facility is expected to be up and running by 2020. Allen’s team won’t continue to fund and operate the center after it is open. Instead, Mercy Housing is raising funds, with a commitment from the city to support efforts to raise money. On-site service providers will include Mary’s Place, Child Care Resources, Refugee Women’s Alliance, Valley Cities Behavior Health Center, and Mercy Housing.

In addition to funds for much-needed homeless services, the commitments from Allen and Bezos bring added attention to an issue that doesn’t have many billionaire benefactors. But they can still only make a dent in a crisis that requires significant and ongoing resources. A report earlier this year by consultants at McKinsey estimates that at least $360 million to $410 million is needed to house Seattle’s homeless population.

“This is a great project but everyone understands the need is much greater than any one project,” Durkan said. “No one project or one entity is going to be the entire solution. Government has to double its efforts, the community has to double its efforts, we’ve got to get the state to be a better partner. We’ve got to get the federal government to be a better partner. I don’t have a lot of hope for that right now so that means it’s up to us.”","The Mount Baker Family Housing & Resource Center will combine permanent housing for homeless and low-income families with transitional housing and community resources.

“This is a day for us to remember,” said Joe Gunter, mayor of Salinas. “Everybody involved in this project should walk with their head held high today. This is a unique project with a lot of great partners … it will be a great asset to this community.”

The Haciendas project replaced 100 dilapidated housing units with 200 modern efficient living spaces overall. Hikari – meaning “light” in Japanese – is the final phase of the four-phase Haciendas redevelopment project. It replaced 14 deteriorating public housing units with 50 multi-family, energy-efficient affordable housing units. It is the first affordable housing development on the Central Coast to be constructed using systems-built modular buildings which were constructed completely off-site and transported to Salinas.

“I think any day you can deliver 50 affordable housing units is a good day,” said Starla Warren, CEO of the Housing Development Consulting Corporation which developed Hikari. “Of these four developments there were originally 100 public housing units in a nearly contiguous areas, we demolished all of those over time and built 200 units. Ninety eight percent of the residents who originally lived here currently live in one of these four developments.”

The almost $26-million undertaking was financed through a number of sources including low income housing tax credits, city of Salinas HOME funds, seller financing, Housing Authority County of Monterey financing, city deferred impact and processing fees, and deferred developer fee, among others.

The newly-constructed, multi-family affordable housing Hikari development contains 19 one-bedroom units, 16 two-bedroom, and 15 three-bedroom living spaces. It targets residents with incomes at the 30, 50 and 60 percent annual median income levels. All units will receive Housing and Urban Development project-based voucher assistance except for the on-site manager unit.

At a time when the housing, finance and construction markets were rapidly changing, completing the final phase of the Haciendas project was a challenge.

“These gentlemen, the funders and equity partners, alluded a little bit to what we went through,” Warren said. “But there’s nothing like getting a phone call and 10 minutes later you’ve lost $4 million dollars in your funding sources or opening a bid and being 25 percent over budget and trying to figure out how you will deal with that … or being in the middle of the river and changing from stick-built to modular … it’s a lot of pressure.”

Warren said HDC’s partner – the city of Salinas – has been a tremendous support in recognizing the difficulty in delivering the units.

“Though it will not get easier it will continue to be done,” said Warren.

HDC has built about 1,700 units in Monterey County with projects in Salinas, Greenfield and currently in Castroville.

“This is what partnership is all about,” said Jose Gomez, division director, HUD San Francisco. “This is what the housing department is looking forward to … and I commend the housing authority and Starla and her team for being ahead in showing this property.”

The site uses solar energy to offset all common area usage as well as a portion of the tenant’s usage. It is greenpoint rated, energy star certified and exceeds the California energy commission’s efficiency standards. The storm water system utilizes plants and permeable concrete to clean and treat storm runoff prior to release into the city’s storm drain system.

The four-phase Haciendas project has shared community rooms, common spaces for gatherings and support. On-site resident services help people living in the complex with job and computer skills.

“Talk about doing the once seemingly impossible and turning this into something beautiful and dignified for local families and residents … this is amazing,” said Luis Alejo, Monterey County Supervisor. “We all know that when we lift the least among us … we lift up everyone in the Golden State.”","Salinas >> The Monterey County Housing Authority Development Corporation celebrated the grand opening of its most recent affordable housing development at an event on Thursday morning with local leaders in government, redevelopment, and the general public in attendance.
This is a unique project with a lot of great partners … it will be a great asset to this community.”The Haciendas project replaced 100 dilapidated housing units with 200 modern efficient living spaces overall.
It replaced 14 deteriorating public housing units with 50 multi-family, energy-efficient affordable housing units.
It is the first affordable housing development on the Central Coast to be constructed using systems-built modular buildings which were constructed completely off-site and transported to Salinas.
“I think any day you can deliver 50 affordable housing units is a good day,” said Starla Warren, CEO of the Housing Development Consulting Corporation which developed Hikari."

Just 27 miles from Atlanta, something unique is happening. Princeton Village, a new-home community by Centex Homes in Palmetto, Georgia, is going up. Homes at Princeton Village start in the high-$100,000s, a steal in any housing market in the country.

What’s more, homebuyers can choose from three-, four- and five-bedroom single-family homes with plenty of features. The homes come with an extended warranty and energy-efficient features. A community pool and tennis courts are a few of the family-friendly amenities.

Anyone who’s searched for an affordable home lately – new-construction or not – knows it’s rough in cities with a tight housing inventory. Newly built homes have become an attractive option for those who want to skip bidding wars and start with a clean slate. But, many builders now are focused on higher-priced homes, making it harder to find new-construction within reach for many homebuyers, particularly first-time buyers.

However, there still are affordable new homes being built, says Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). These affordable new-construction homes tend to be smaller single-family residences that have fewer customizable features. On the other hand, the new-construction townhome market has increased by 23%. That’s because Millennials and Boomers, who make up a large share of today’s homebuyers, are more accepting of housing types other than single-family homes and because, for builders, it’s an economically useful way to build more homes on a smaller amount of space.

“As Millennials move from rentership to ownership, it’s not a big surprise to see this trend,” Dietz says. “Typical townhouses are about 2,000 square feet, so that’s a little smaller (than single-family residences) … but the thing they do reflect is, if you look at younger Gen Xers and certainly Millennials, they do want single-family – that is, they want a front door to their own unit – they want a suburban aesthetic, and they want the opportunity to own. But there has been a change or a movement to more walkable neighborhoods. Townhouses check that box as well.

Lack of new homes and affordability are some reasons that new-home sales have dropped to a nine-month low, according to the NAHB. In July, the number of new-home sales declined to 1.7%, or 627,000 homes. One reason that builders have trouble making profits from affordable starter homes is that construction and land costs are going up.

“Between 2011 and 2016, (land development and home construction) costs had reached 29%, which makes up about a quarter of a home’s price,” Dietz says. “For a typical home being built, you’re looking at about $80,000 of upfront fixed regulatory costs. … It’s no wonder that builders in the past 5 to 10 years or so have gone to $300,000-and-up markets.”

But all is not lost. Homebuilders with a national reach have been building a small number of starter homes at affordable prices. Builders like D.R. Horton, Centex and Ashton Woods are working to build a product that can help alleviate the problem, particularly for first-time buyers. Since 2014, D.R. Horton has been offering Express Homes, its entry-level brand of homes that feature minimal design features and options to help buyers get a foot into homeownership.

For its part, Centex is offering affordable new homes not just near Atlanta, but throughout the country that come with popular options to ensure buyers get a home that’s not just affordable, but stylish, too. “We know that people want affordability and that they’re trying to work within their personal budget, but everybody likes nice things,” Brent Landry, division president at PulteGroup in the Greater Atlanta area, says. “We believe things can be elegant and affordable.”

Ashton Woods Homes, based in Roswell, Georgia, launched its line of affordable new homes, Starlight Homes, last year to great success. Starlight Homes is also offering buyers affordable homes with “high design and attention to detail.”

“We specifically introduced Starlight Homes to address the growing entry-level buyer,” says Carrie Schonberg, chief marketing officer of Ashton Woods Homes. “Everyone deserves the chance to make their home a reality without breaking the bank. We felt we had the opportunity to do something really different, something really special, in the entry-level market.”

At a time when it’s tough for builders to make a profit from starter homes, why are some builders offering affordable lines? Schonberg says for Ashton Woods, there were three things that came together that meant there would be high demand for such a product:

First-time homebuyers are flooding the market. Apartment rents are increasing. Demand is outpacing supply.

Ashton Woods saw an opportunity with Starlight Homes, Schonberg says.

While the homebuying situation sounds bleak, Dietz says there are still plenty of opportunities for homebuyers looking for affordable new homes. To help put themselves in the best position possible to purchase a home, Dietz suggests saving for a down payment and budgeting, as well as scoping out the area buyers want to live by checking the cost of living.","However, there still are affordable new homes being built, says Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).

(Photo courtesy: Getty Images)

Gypsum is said to be a part of recent advancements made in the field of construction. However, several archeological surveys have proven that it has been used in ancient cultures like ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England.

Formed as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite, gypsum is a crucial eco-friendly component used in the construction. Its industrial wastes are conventionally called 'green materials'.

Gypsum is an eco-friendly resource:

Taking this project one step forward, IIT Madras is making it more environment-friendly.

""Manufacture of GFRG (Glass Fibre Reinforced Gypsum) panels from the raw material gypsum, viz., natural gypsum, mineral gypsum, phospho-gypsum or chemical gypsum, with purity more than 90 per cent, entails less energy in comparison to energy-intensive conventional building materials like, brick, concrete, etc,"" says Meher Prasad, a professor of Structural Engineering Division under the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras.

GFRG panels have been approved as a green material by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

GFRG have also been approved by the World Bank as being eligible for 'carbon credits' under the Kyoto Protocol.

Further, the manufacture of GFRG panels from phospho-gypsum (fertilizer industry waste) is another green material. It eliminates the use of bricks.

""Increased thermal resistance of gypsum, reduces the air conditioning load on the buildings, thus reducing the operational energy need in GFRG buildings,'' says Prasad.

As far as India is concerned, manufacture of GFRG panels from phospho-gypsum (fertilizer industry waste) adds further to the greenness of the material.

Further, GFRG building construction totally eliminates the use of bricks.

The increased thermal resistance of gypsum reduces the air conditioning load on the buildings, thus reducing the operational energy need in GFRG buildings.

All of these factors add sustainability with regard to the use of GFRG technology.

How is GFRG different from gypsum?

GFRG, which is commercially known as Rapidwall®, are prefabricated hollow panels, introduced in Australia as an alternative building material in 1990.

Although gypsum is not water resistant, advancement of the mineral as GFRG panels have made it load bearing, water-resistant property, enabling it to be used as structural part (internal and external walls) in building assemblies.

Uses of GFRG in India

This technology was introduced in India in 2003, using all kinds of gypsum. IIT Madras is carrying significant research on the same in order to introduce affordable mass housing construction.

Although the use of gypsum is limited, ''IIT Madras has extended the use of panels as floor/roof slabs, staircase waist, and landing slabs. A complete building system was thus proposed by IIT Madras, with the use of GFRG panels alone, with minimal use of concrete and steel, and avoiding entirely the use of bricks,'' adds Prasad.

Moreover, after the sheer efforts of the university, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the Government of India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has recently approved standards for the structural design of GFRG buildings, which is currently under wide circulation.

Overall benefits of GFRG technology:

Here's a look at the list of the benefits of using GFRG technology, in comparison to conventional technologies:

Substantial reduction in the structural weight of the building (panels weigh only 44 kg/m 2 ) contributing to savings in foundation and reduction in earthquake design forces, particularly in multi-storeyed construction

) contributing to savings in foundation and reduction in earthquake design forces, particularly in multi-storeyed construction No plastering requirement for walls and ceiling

Increased speed of construction with lesser manpower

Save fertile agricultural land and energy intensive burnt clay bricks

Saving of 8-10 per cent built-up area for the same carpet area

It is expected that GFRG buildings are more durable than similar conventional buildings, as the concrete and steel are encased by the GFRG shell.

In what has been described as a revolution in Edo State’s housing sector, the first set of homeowners in Governor Godwin Obaseki’s affordable housing project, Emotan Gardens, will move into their property at the end of the year.



Executive Chairman, Edo Development and Property Agency (EDPA), Isoken Omo, disclosed this in a chat with journalists and assured prospective buyers that 86 units of the houses, which constitute the first phase of the project, will be delivered before the end of 2018.

She said, “Emotan Gardens is a 1, 800-unit gated housing estate which will be done in phases and clusters. The first phase is actually a show phase with about 86 units in it. When it is finished, people can live there. While they are living there, the other phases will be built. In the end, everything will be joined together to become a full estate.”

She explained that the construction of the 86 units is ongoing and assured that it will be ready at the end of the year, noting, “By then people will live there. There will be infrastructure and not just the houses will be ready. We will have roads, lawns, water and electricity there.”

According to her, “The sales for the properties opened at the Edo National Association Worldwide (ENAW) convention, in Toronto, Canada. All the slots are available. Because it is being delivered in phases, it will work in two ways so that we will deliver on our promise. For example, if you don’t have all the money, and then deposit some amount and tell us when you want it ready, it gives us enough time to build up capital.”

On the first phase, Isoken explained, “We have different types. We have four 2-bedroom in a row; 3-bedroom row of houses, 2 and 3-bedroom semi-detached; 3-bedroom semi-detached; blocks of flats; 4-bedroom stand-alone bungalows, terrace houses, 3-bedroom with a maid quarters.

“We have commercial plots and residential plots. Within the commercial plot, we have shopping malls. Within the estate, we have made provision for school, hospital, police station and all those things you need in a community.”

Explaining that there is provision for those who want to build for themselves to buy plots of land, she said, “You can buy a plot of 450 sqm land or 900 sqm land. There is a design guide but it is not rigid. The guide is to ensure homogeneity.”

On the prices for the houses, Isoken said, “The house starts from N5.7 million for the cluster of 2-bedrooms and it goes up to N7m, N8m, N9m and so, according to the housing type. But N5.7m is the entry price. We expect 25 per cent down payment at expression of interest, and then you complete the necessary forms, including the Know Your Customer (KYC) form.

She explained that the KYC form is to “ensure the money is not laundered, and that it came from a clean channel. The onus is on us to check that to ensure we don’t fall foul of the laws. After this, we process the form, then you pay the deposit and we send you your Letter of Offer with terms of payment.

“There are different payment options. We have outright purchase; 18-month payment plan for payment in tranches, and mortgage arrangement. We are looking at different mortgage options that people can tap into which will be affordable.”

Isoken assured prospective buyers that the model house and other houses on that row are nearly completed, while painting work is ongoing, adding, “The inside of the model house is ready. We are painting others on that row. Some are at the roofing stage, others are at the block stage. By December when we are ready to deliver, all of them will be ready. At the same time work is ongoing on the greenery.”

If you’re looking for total control over your stereo listening experience, an integrated amplifier might be a better way to go than a standard A/V receiver, as it lets you pick and choose your components. While you can easily spend thousands of dollars on an amplifier like the Nain Uniti Atom, you don’t need to spend nearly that much for great results, as Onkyo is looking to show with its A-9110 integrated amplifier.

The two-channel A-9110 delivers 50 watts of power per channel at four ohms, and is the follow-up to Onkyo’s acclaimed A-9010, adding features while keeping the same impeccable build quality that made the original so popular. This model retails for $350, and Onkyo calls it a “perfect entry point for high-quality stereo sound.” If you’re just getting into collecting vinyl and you’re looking to put together a vinyl listening setup, this could be a key component.

On the front panel, you’ll find a simple layout with a volume knob, bass and treble controls, and a button to enable the A-9110’s Phase Matching Bass Boost, which aligns bass and lower midrange frequencies above 300 Hz for tighter bass. If you’re running your own preamp or EQ and don’t want these in your signal chain, another button enables Direct Mode, where the tone controls and Phase Matching Bass Boost circuits are bypassed.

On the rear panel you’ll find output jacks for stereo speakers, as well as a pre-out for an optional subwoofer. When it comes to inputs, you’ll find four line inputs as well as a dedicated phono input for connecting your turntable, complete with a ground connection. A Remote Interactive jack on the back helps unify your controls with compatible Onkyo CD players, digital tuners, and network streamers.

The A-9110 features Onkyo’s Wide Range Amplification Technology (WRAT) which, aside from being a fun acronym, is key the the dynamics found in the amplifier. The amplifier uses a high-output transformer, discrete transistors, and audio-grade capacitors to keep your signal as clean as possible. This attention to detail extends to the chassis as well, with a thicker, more rigid frame that better dampens vibrations than its predecessor.

“The introduction of the A-9110 continues Onkyo’s impressive legacy of innovation and function with its 2-channel product offerings,” Onkyo USA Director of Marketing & Product Localization Don Milks said in a statement. “With vinyl and other stereo components enjoying a renaissance, we are pleased to offer such a high-quality, performance-driven amp like the A-9110.”

7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.

7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

ADVERTISEMENT

7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

7.A By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

7.B By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support.

Progress to date

For many working in the green economy SDG7 is the big one: the goal they have the potential to make the biggest contribution to and the keystone targets that are critical to virtually every other development priority.

As such, there will be no surprises in the UN's short and sharp progress report and its punchy assessment of current efforts. ""Progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency,"" the UN states. ""Meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale.""

It is an assessment that will be familiar to anyone who has kept track of the various annual updates from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): the energy industry is in the midst of a rapid transformation in many markets as clean energy replaces dirty incumbents, but the reality is progress has been far too slow to meet the SDGs and the targets contained in the Paris Agreement.

Renewables capacity may be growing rapidly, but steady increases in overall global energy demand meant that between 2012 and 2014 renewables share of total energy consumption did no more than inch upwards from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent.

Moreover, while plummeting wind and solar costs have made renewables the default form of new power generation in a growing number of markets progress in the heat and transport sectors - which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption - has been much slower. In addition, there is also worrying recent evidence that progress in the power sector may be slowing. Both the IEA and oil giant BP have reported that emissions from the energy sector rose last year and while the renewables industry continues to grow overall investment levels have fallen slightly in recent years.

There has been more encouraging progress on energy efficiency, with three quarters of the world's largest energy consuming economies reducing their energy intensity, in some cases by significant margins. As a result global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent in 2015 from 2014, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010. However, the UN still warns continued policy action is required to ensure this encouraging momentum is maintained.

And then there is the on-going challenge of energy access. There has been significant progress with the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increasing from 78 per cent in 2000 to 87 per cent in 2016. However, with the bulk of communities without access to reliable power in rural areas there are signs progress is slowing. Between 2012 and 2014 access increased by just 0.3 percentage points.

According to the latest figures just under one billion people still live without electricity, and while off grid renewables and microgrids present a potential cost effective solution for rural communities in the developing world the fledgling sector remains small compared to the scale of the challenge.

Cooking and heating similarly present a major development challenge with access to clean fuels standing at 59 per cent in 2016 - an increase of just 10 percentage points since 2000. ""More than three billion people, the majority of them in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies,"" the UN said, a scenario that leads to serious air pollution and related health issues, as well as deforestation and biodiversity loss. Higher costs, lack of access to finance, and low levels of awareness about the importance of clean fuels are all hampering the roll out of clean technologies.

Business implications

There is no hiding from SDG7. Unlike some of the other goals it requires fundamental transformation in industrialised and developing economies alike. There may be relatively few targets, but there is no business that will not be affected by the pursuit of SDG7. Efforts to provide universal affordable and clean energy will obviously impact the energy industry and related sectors such as transport and construction most, but ultimately every business will be affected by the resulting disruption.

Businesses need to consider both the direct and indirect impacts that will result from SDG7. Failure to meet the goal will make the delivery of most of the other SDGs, not to mention the Paris Agreement, all but impossible, leading to significant climate and security risks as well as stalled economic development in emerging markets.

At the same time a concerted effort to deliver on the goal could lead to huge disruption along multiple vectors in every jurisdiction. Significant energy market reforms, more robust energy efficiency standards, the wider use of carbon pricing, and the rapid integration of the energy, building, and transport sectors are all likely. Effective policies and investments could keep cost and energy security impacts to a minimum, but poorly planned or executed policies raise the prospect of higher costs and less reliable energy.

In emerging markets the trend towards microgrids provides a chance to demonstrate that decentralised energy systems can work, which could have major repercussions for incumbents that are wedded to centralised energy systems.

Business risks

The biggest business risk associated with SDG7 would arise from the failure to respond to recent sluggish progress in the transition away from fossil fuel energy. Unless the goal is broadly met economic growth in emerging markets will not be maximised and the Paris Agreement will not be honoured, leading to a significant escalation in climate risks.

However, at the same time significant risks will arise from efforts to meet SDG7, which will only be amplified for those businesses that fail to engage with the technology revolution sweeping the energy industry.

Clean energy costs may be falling rapidly, but there are still plenty of regions where policy support is required to drive clean tech deployment at scale, be it through the subsidised deployment of cleaner stoves, renewable energy contracts, or trials for marine energy technologies. Such moves could result in higher taxes, higher carbon prices, and higher energy costs for some businesses in the short term. It is also likely to require increased R&D spend amongst energy firms and heavy energy users to accelerate the development of the lower cost clean energy sources and energy efficiency gains that are required.

Similarly, more demanding energy efficiency standards will deliver cost savings for businesses, but will also increase the regulatory burden for those firms that fail to respond.

Cost, air quality, and climate-related benefits should be unlocked in the longer term by clean energy policies, but businesses are still likely to be asked to provide much of the initial capital required to drive a green industrial revolution.

There is also a specific risk for parts of the clean energy sector arising from the wording of the SDG7 targets and the indicators selected to track progress. SDG7A may call for enhanced international cooperation to ""facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology"". But at the same time SDG7.2 calls specifically for a substantial increase in ""the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix"". Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage are notable by their absence. As such proponents of a technology neutral approach to decarbonisation will argue there is a risk that alternative sources of clean energy are sidelined in favour of renewables-focused policies.

More broadly, the technology revolution already well underway across the energy and automotive sectors will fuel so-called 'carbon bubble' risks whereby investors in carbon intensive assets risk seeing their investments become stranded as a result of more competitive clean technologies and more robust climate and air pollution policies. Unless investors and regulators respond sensibly to the disruption underway in the energy and transport industry an avalanche of stranded assets could have significant implications for financial stability.

Business opportunities

It is no exaggeration to suggest the business opportunities arising from SDG7 could amount to trillions of dollars. The IEA has previously said fully implementing the national pledges made under the Paris Agreement - which themselves are inadequate for meeting the Agreement's targets and the SDGs - would require $13.5tr in energy efficiency and low carbon technology investment between 2015 and 2030. The bulk of that investment will inevitably be focused on energy infrastructure.

The flip side to the disruption that will arise as the result of the transition to a low carbon energy system is the massive commercial, economic, jobs, and health benefits on offer from the emergence of technologies that boast lower running costs, fewer polluting externalities, and potentially higher levels of energy access and security.

All businesses stand to benefit from improvements in energy efficiency that will inevitably result in lower costs and higher productivity. At the same time plummeting renewables and energy storage costs point to lower power prices in the long run, along with fewer health impacts, especially in emerging economies.

The commitment to step up R&D and support cleaner fossil fuels and energy infrastructure also suggests promising new markets for next generation nuclear and CCS, as well as critically important smart grids, even if they are not mentioned by name in the targets. Decarbonising heat and heavy industry remains a major challenge, but it again points to increased R&D spend and the potential for massive new markets as greener technologies emerge.

At the same time the related revolution in electric and automated vehicles raises the prospect of major new revenue streams for the transport sector, coupled with reduced air pollution and congestion, as well as improved services and lower running costs for customers.

More broadly, continued efforts to expand energy access and get cleaner cooking and heating fuels into developing economy communities should unlock economic growth while curbing land use impacts.

Meanwhile, astute allocation of capital and improved climate disclosures from businesses should help minimise carbon bubble risks.

At the heart of SDG7 sits one of the biggest industrial revolutions the world has ever undertaken. As such it should drive the creation of huge new global markets, with the immense business opportunities that the green energy revolution brings with it.","7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
7.A By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

It is also likely to require increased R&D spend amongst energy firms and heavy energy users to accelerate the development of the lower cost clean energy sources and energy efficiency gains that are required.

The Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy proposal –– which would replace the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan –– focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through loosening up the strict rules governing pollutants set forth in the Obama-era plan.

But advocates, as well as politicians, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley and Lt. Gov. candidate Juliana Stratton, say the plan is harmful.

Madigan, who testified at the only public hearing on the matter at the Metcalfe Federal Building, recounted calling the proposal “even worse than repealing the CPP because it could allow for even more pollution than if the US EPA simply did nothing.”

At the rally outside, she said, “Disgracefully, the current administration wants to roll back critical protections for our air, land and water.”

“U.S. EPA’s proposal is a full retreat in our battle against climate change,” Madigan said. “The U.S. EPA should increase the CPP’s ambition, not replace it with a hollow regulation that backtracks on advances already achieved … The so-called clean energy proposal cannot stand and if it is adopted I will take legal action to see that it is overturned.”

Energy is at the root of modern economies and is vital to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Internet of Things. The challenge for policymakers is to craft policy frameworks that enable the three critical goals of energy security, environmental sustainability, and affordability and access while the energy sector undergoes a fundamental transition. Maintaining a balance between these three goals creates a “trilemma,” which is getting more complex for countries and energy companies—especially given the uncertain pace of the transition to decentralized, decarbonized, and digital systems. Put differently, we are trying to build a bridge while crossing it.

The comparative rankings and profiles of the 125 economies covered in the World Energy Trilemma Index 2018 highlight how the exponential acceleration of interconnected megatrends shaping the global energy sector are rapidly evolving the means to achieve and balance energy trilemma goals.

Energy Security

Evolving energy sources are shifting the definition of and means by which to achieve energy security. In a fossil fuel-driven world, energy security was ensured by the security of energy supply. But technology has led to increased supply of natural gas and has driven improved performance and reduced costs of renewables. Today’s energy security increasingly implies flexibility of a diversified grid, which is hard to measure and even harder to ensure.

For example, coal-fired electricity generation in OECD countries is in terminal decline. Initially displaced by cleaner natural gas, it has been increasingly losing ground to renewable sources that continue to grow faster than predicted: The share of renewable generation has doubled every 5.5 years. Under these trends, coal-fired power and nuclear will no longer be viable sources of power in OECD countries by 2050. For example, in the U.S., the share of electricity generated from coal dropped from 52.8 percent in 1997, to 45 percent in 2009, and then to 30.1 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the share of natural gas in 2017 stood at 31.7 percent, and the share of renewables was at 17.1 percent.

On this trajectory, by 2050, up to 90 percent of OECD generation will be from renewables. The IEA predicts that the share of all renewables in total global power generation will be 40 percent by 2040.

Looking outside the OECD, coal as a percentage of total electricity generation is expected to remain high in the near term. For example, coal is on track to grow to 75 percent in India by 2027 and to 56 percent percent in Indonesia in the near term.

However, China may be indicative of future trends in other countries that hope to balance energy security, increased energy access and environmental sustainability. Coal is on track to drop to 56 percent of total energy generation in China—from 80 percent in 2007 as China continues its focus on increasing renewables.

Fossil fuels are also impacted by the movement to divest from fossil fuel, which has grown 11,900 percent from $52 billion assets under management four years ago to over $6 trillion today, with nearly 1,000 institutional investors pledging to divest from coal, oil and gas. This trend is likely to have increasing impacts beyond OECD countries in upcoming years. Along with this, investment in clean energy has grown at 14 percent CAGR over the past 10 years.

Access and Affordability

Decentralization and democratization of the energy system will shift the definition of energy access and affordability.

The complexity of issues facing the globalized energy industry are impossible for countries to tackle in isolation.

The adoption of renewable generation, distributed energy resources (DER), deployment of smart grids, energy storage solutions, and electrification of transport are just some of the trends transforming the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Supplies of ever-cheaper mainstream wind and solar power are driving down wholesale electricity prices. The expansion of renewables is expected to further drive growth in battery storage capacity and subsequently decrease installation costs, further disrupting the traditional model of centralized power generation and distribution. Many incumbent utilities companies in Western countries are struggling to adapt, as their business models are perceived as in decline. They may soon be replaced by potentially new business models from challenger companies.

Under these forces, Europe will see a mostly decentralized and highly democratized energy system by 2040. Elsewhere, DER is creating new opportunities for low-income economies to provide secure, reliable and affordable energy through mini- or microgrids.

The number of residential and industrial “prosumers”—those who both consume and produce electricity—at a local level is already rising. They will soon play a far more active role in the energy system as a whole as they look to manage energy costs and the sources of their energy, enabled by evolving technologies such as blockchain.

For example, in September 2018, Apple, Akamai, Etsy and Swiss Re leveraged their collective buying power jointly to purchase renewable energy in the U.S. PJM energy market with the largest aggregated corporate renewable energy transaction to date.

Environmental Sustainability

Shifts in electricity generation and transportation fuels will help meet energy sustainability goals, and the energy transition will change the economics of the oil and gas industry. For example, recently, nearly 400 global companies, cities, states and regions set 100 percent renewable energy targets and/or zero-emissions targets, including California, the world’s fifth-largest economy, and companies with collective annual revenues of more than $2.75 trillion.

Energy companies and regulators will have to adapt and develop innovative mechanisms to respond to these goals. The shift to electrification of mobility will impact liquid-fuels demand and create new competitors and collaborators. Consider the e-vehicle charging infrastructure initiative in California backed by the state’s three investor-owned utilities. The lines are blurring between utilities, O&G majors and investors as drivers of disruption challenge existing structures.

As with other areas of the energy transition, the pace of electrification is uncertain but can be expected to grow rapidly. Regulations, including pressure to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, are pushing the switch toward EVs, with predictions of worldwide e-vehicle growth at 11 million in 2025 and with China accounting for almost 50 percent of the global EV market. Countries and companies are battling for competitive position in the changing mobility sector. The UK, for example, recently set out a plan to become the world leader in electric and zero-emission vans, trucks and cars.

Looking Ahead

Leveraging evolving technology opportunities to simultaneously focus on the three aspects of the energy trilemma—security, equity and environmental sustainability—can not only grow economies, but can also transform societies. Yet the complexity of issues facing the globalized energy industry are impossible for countries to tackle in isolation.

Navigating through evolving policy and regulatory frameworks across states, along with innovating in the field of power generation, is key to achieving progress and maintaining balance. In this changing context, policymakers at all levels and those in the energy sector, both legacy and new players, must engage to ensure policy and regulatory frameworks enable economies and societies to fully leverage the new opportunities to meet the energy trilemma.","The challenge for policymakers is to craft policy frameworks that enable the three critical goals of energy security, environmental sustainability, and affordability and access while the energy sector undergoes a fundamental transition.

Comparing Electric Rates, Bills, and Burden","Nearly 1 in 3 US residential household struggles to pay their electric bill. With so many folks struggling, it raises a question: What makes electricity “affordable?”

Do you know what you pay for electricity?

It’s okay if you don’t. A lot of folks probably don’t.

The most commonly used data source for calculating the average retail electricity rate* is from the Energy Information Agency (EIA), part of the US Department of Energy. EIA reports data on electricity price ($/kWh). This value takes your average monthly bill ($), divided by the average energy consumption in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Straightforward enough.

Using this average makes Southern and Western states look like they have affordable energy (Map 1). I often hear utilities and government officials in the South bragging how low their rates are. They’ll point to the high rates of Massachusetts, California, New York, or Hawaii for comparison.

Looking at this map, California, and Northeastern states do look expensive…

But such conclusions aren’t as cut and dry as you might think.

At best, rates tell you very little. At worst, fixating on rates could mislead people into thinking electricity in some regions is more affordable than it really is.

Why?

Rates don’t reflect how much energy the average customer consumes. Bills , on the other hand, are what households pay every month.

Bills, bills, bills

Bills are a better metric on how affordable electricity is because that’s what you have to pay each month. For many struggling households, the total electricity bill plays a determining factor in how much money you’ll have to spend on other things.

And, somewhat unintuitively, bills are comparatively lower in many of the “high rates” states (Map 2). Meanwhile, the “low rates” southeastern states begin to look expensive.

When we were only looking at rates, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina all looked like they had affordable electricity. However, residential customers in those states have some of the highest bills in the country.

Why?

Low bill states tend to have policies that enable customers to lower their bills. Rooftop solar, market competition, and even rate structure can translate into savings for customers. But mostly, the credit belongs to energy efficiency.

Massachusetts which had the 4th highest rates but the 36th lowest bills. Massachusetts is ranked 1st in energy efficiency by ACEEE.

California, which had the 7th highest rates but the 15th lowest bills. California is ranked 2nd in energy efficiency by ACEEE.

Louisiana has the 2nd lowest rates but only the 34th lowest bills. Louisiana is ranked 47th by ACEEE in terms of energy efficiency.

Mississippi has the 15th lowest rates but has the 10th highest bills. It was ranked 44th by ACEEE in terms of energy efficiency.

Other “low rates” states, like Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, Georgia, and South Carolina, all have lower than average rates but higher than average bills. These states also rank low in energy efficiency.

But even bills only tell part of the story.

Electricity burden

While the average bill in Hawaii or Connecticut is higher than the national average (Hawaii has the highest average bill, Connecticut has the 3rd highest), average household income in those states is also higher than the national average. In both Connecticut and Hawaii, the average household spends 2.3% of their annual income on electricity. The national average is also 2.3%.

Energy burden is the percent of one’s income you spend on all energy (electricity, heating, gasoline, etc.…). Electricity is one part of the energy burden (Map 3).

The analysis presented here is limited to averages. The average income. The average consumption of electricity.

This analysis doesn’t account for intrastate variances in household incomes. Nor does it account for differences in electricity consumption. It is a simple comparison of the average bill as a percent of average income. Far from a perfect measure, but it’s still the next step in looking at electricity affordability.

Looking at averages isn’t to say that folks in states with lower than average electricity burden don’t also struggle to pay their bills. Yes, lower income folks do consume less but they do typically spend a higher percentage of their income on energy overall. The energy burden on low-income households is real and substantial. It is real in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia, regardless of averages.

So what good is this analysis?

The analysis does illustrate how misleading the focus on rates is.

Bills—what people actually pay—can look very different from rates. Focusing on rates distracts from the important policy question: How can we ensure that energy is affordable?

This analysis highlights that the low rates of the South are a poor indication of electric affordability in those states.

Next month I’ll be presenting at an annual conference of consumer advocates. Consumer advocates have long been focused on electricity affordability. Energy efficiency is a great step in making electricity more affordable. Energy efficiency helps avoid or defer expensive investments that utilities would otherwise have to make, which means it helps all customers save money. Energy efficiency helps consumers lower their bills. And, energy efficiency policies and programs can target efforts to make sure that all consumer groups can benefit and participate in efficiency programs.

What follows is a list of states and ranks for their rates, bills, ACEEE energy efficiency score, and percent of income spent on electricity (burden). The number in each cell reflects that state’s rank, from low to high. So, for example, Alabama is the 28th cheapest state for rates, but the worst state in terms of electricity burden.

* This “rate” isn’t the same as the variable rate of your electric bill—the amount you pay for each kWh you use or the amount of money you save for each kWh you conserve. For this analysis, I’ve only looked at the retail rates and bills of residential customers.

According to the City of Chicago data portal, as of July 2018, the ARO has only generated 334 affordable units, under both the original 2007 ordinance and the 2015 revision that set a five-year goal of 1,200 units by 2020. That puts the city far behind the pace required to meet the goal. The design and implementation of the ARO does little to mitigate the lack of affordable housing in the city, especially in Northwest Side neighborhoods like Belmont Cragin and Montclare. These neighborhoods are experiencing an affordable housing shortage that has led to a wave of displacement disproportionately affecting Latinos, and left many prospective renters and homeowners unable to afford their monthly housing costs.

The Northwest Side has just 15 affordable units generated by the ARO: 10 in Montclare, three in Belmont Cragin, and two in Portage Park. Belmont Cragin also has relatively little subsidized affordable housing, with just three properties, all senior housing buildings. This shortage contributes to an increase in out-migration to the surrounding suburbs, as the rent burden has far surpassed area income.

SEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com. Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.

In addition, Belmont Cragin was one of the top three neighborhoods with the steepest increases in single-family home prices between 2015 and 2016, with an increase of 15.5 percent. Given this lack of affordable housing, Belmont Cragin residents are severely cost-burdened: As of 2015, 23 percent of all households in the area experienced severe cost burden, defined as paying more than half of household income on rent or mortgage payments.

In response to the current failures of the ARO, the Northwest Side Housing Center is calling on David Reifman, commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development, to respond to Northwest Side homeowners’ requests to meet. And we call on the City of Chicago to expand the Milwaukee Avenue ARO pilot to Belmont Cragin, and eventually, the entire city.

One of the key features of this pilot expansion will prevent developers from “buying out” of building affordable units. To date, the ARO has done little to address where affordable units financed by developer buy-out fees are built. This further concentrates affordable housing and low-income residents in select South Side and West Side neighborhoods. Expanded access to affordable housing and restructuring of the ARO guidelines and fund designations are necessary to preserve housing in Chicago communities on the Northwest Side.

Burying clean power

The Trump administration’s scheme to bury the lifesaving Clean Power Plan would recklessly expose families to more pollution and place the health of our communities at risk. I recently traveled to Chicago to testify during the one and only public hearing on this dangerous proposal. I was in good company with several of Illinois’s staunchest environmental champions in Congress, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, who also spoke up for the millions of people in this country who support the Clean Power Plan.

The Clean Power Plan encouraged investment in clean energy sources like wind and solar. However, the Trump administration’s so called “Affordable Clean Energy” proposal is actually a dirty power scam, because it would deny us cleaner air and the clean energy economy we all deserve. During the activities in Chicago, Congressman Quigley explained how the replacement plan would be a giveaway to corporate polluters.

Sen. Duckworth also took to social media to highlight the devastating health impacts of the proposed plan. She spoke in strong support of the original plan, citing the Trump administration’s own report that found that it would prevent as many as 4,500 premature deaths each year by 2030.

There is overwhelming evidence and broad public support for the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a worse than do-nothing proposal is a huge mistake. I truly appreciate Sen. Duckworth and Congressman Quigley for listening to the people and supporting this lifesaving program.

My resume, mixed with years of professional gambling and decades of following and fighting legal-but-lethal tobacco, forces me to wager a pint of my 66-year-old blood: That Nikki Haley, who is resigning as United Nations Ambassador (and is the former governor of tobacco-rich South Carolina), will follow former Speaker of the House John Boehner by accepting a highly paid tobacco ambassadorship spot. Such a spot would give her a discretionary roll of loot to grease palms in high places to promote tobacco in “low places.”

145,https://grist.org/article/direct-air-carbon-capture-global-thermostat/,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Grist,Affordable carbon capture with a soda on the side,"Peter Eisenberger was a department head at famed innovation hub Bell Labs when he heard that Exxon was worried the world was running out of oil. It was the 1980s, and the fossil fuel company was recruiting physicists to help it explore alternative energy sources. Intrigued by the opportunity, Eisenberger joined up.

Over the course of eight years, he studied potential oil and gas replacements, eventually coming to an epiphany: “The most sustainable economy is one that gets its energy from the sun, hydrogen from water, and carbon from the air, like nature does,” he tells Grist. From Exxon’s perspective, that meant the company needed to invest in solar — and fast.

Eisenberger’s employer, however, didn’t agree. Exxon punted on solar and doubled down on fossil fuels. So Eisenberger left. Twenty years later, he’s dealing with the consequences of that decision by addressing another parameter in his “most sustainable economy” trifecta: extracting carbon from an atmosphere that’s oversaturated with it.

This is, of course, a process that can be done naturally by trees and other plants that need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. But when Eisenberger talks about a sustainable economy, he’s talking about supplementing the work of trees by capturing the greenhouse gas from, say, the smokestack of a coal-fired power plant, or even directly from the air, and then burying it underground or using it for manufacturing plastics or biofuels.

It’s a complex engineering problem — and a concept that’s fraught for those demanding action on climate change. Scrubbing CO2 out of an industrial facility’s emissions could slow the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. At the same time, the added expense would also drive energy prices up.

The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, for years, included so-called “carbon dioxide removal” (CDR) technologies among its list of tools to combat warming — and it labeled them as essential in its most recent report, released Monday. The global authority acknowledges that we will likely not slash emissions quickly enough to hit a target of keeping average global temperatures below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, the new mark where scientists expect to see some of the worst impacts of climate change. Instead, after heading into that danger zone, we can rely on these technologies to draw carbon concentrations (and temperatures) back down.

Among CDR technologies, only so-called “direct air capture” can claim to be fully carbon negative — with the potential of sopping up more of the greenhouse gas than even trees. The others, like smokestack removal, are largely carbon neutral. Still, the IPCC readily admits, “Most CDR technologies remain largely unproven to date and raise substantial concerns about adverse side-effects on environmental and social sustainability.”

Direct air capture, which involves plucking carbon from the air we breathe, is among the least developed of the carbon removal options. And while it is far more palatable to environmentalists than cleaning plant fumes, it also costs much more.

But that may be changing. In 2010, Eisenberger launched a new startup, Global Thermostat, with climate economist Graciela Chichilnisky (who, as part of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore). Global Thermostat is one of three companies that are pioneering the effort to make the challenging technology involved in direct air capture of carbon financially viable. A major deal recently inked by Global Thermostat could signal a shift in the market. If it pans out, we might be getting close to having this key technology as part of our planet-saving arsenal.

Carbon for sale

A rule of chemical engineering is that the cost of removing a pollutant is inversely proportional to its concentration. Since carbon dioxide is hundreds of times more dilute in the atmosphere than it is in, say, the plumes emanating from a coal plant, it should cost hundreds of times more to remove it from air. So consensus estimates for the cost of direct air capture started out at a wildly cost-prohibitive $600 per ton of carbon dioxide recovered.

There are two main ways to bring that price tag down. One is technological — essentially building more innovative plants that can retrieve the greenhouse gas from air more efficiently. The other is financial. If a company like Global Thermostat can find buyers for the CO2 they’re able to recover, it’ll make the process cheaper overall.

This spring, one of Global Thermostat’s competitors announced that it has a path to bring that price tag down to $94 per ton. Carbon Engineering, a Canadian outfit, plans to turn captured CO2 into synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Founder David Keith described the company’s plans to the Atlantic and scientists hailed the proposal as an important breakthrough.

But Eisenberger, Global Thermostat’s chief technology officer, says his company can go even lower. He says that his firm has “irrevocably shown that a price of $50 per ton is achievable.” The first step to getting there is a substantial deal the company negotiated with a major soft drink manufacturer, CEO Chichilniksy tells Grist.

That’s right — Eisenberger wants to reduce the cost of carbon capture by taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and selling it to soda companies.

Global Thermostat is building its first commercial-scale direct air capture plant in Huntsville, Alabama. This particular plant will have an operating cost of $150 per ton of carbon dioxide it recovers (and sells to bottlers). Smaller, shipping container-sized versions of the plant will capture CO2 to be used for both “green bubbles” and as a raw material for making plastic bottles at the soda-maker’s facilities in Florida and Washington state. Since the capture plants will be installed on the factories’ premises, CO2 will be piped directly into the manufacturing facility, saving energy and transportation costs.

The direct air capture system in Alabama is expected to produce a relatively meager 4,000 tons of CO2 annually (equivalent to taking 700 cars off the road), Chichilnisky says. However, she adds, if Global Thermostat built bigger plants for industries that require more carbon, the amount it could deliver “goes up to a million tons of CO2 per year or more — all removed from air.” (That’s the equivalent of taking 170,000 cars off the road.)

These other industries could include water desalination, dry ice, or plastics. It could also compete with Carbon Engineering in the synthetic fuels market. At the rates Chichilnisky quotes, fewer than 400 Global Thermostat plants could potentially suck up 1 percent of global emissions — effectively removing more than 60 million cars from the road.

Here’s how the company’s technology works. Global Thermostat modeled its system on catalytic converters. You know, that thing in your Honda Accord that clogs up and causes your “check engine” light to flicker constantly. Converters clean up toxic emissions from burning fuel using heat from the engine — they require around 600 degrees F to work properly — and a chemical that pops apart the bonds that hold together harmful gases. The resulting emissions are harmless water and less-immediately harmless CO2.

This is essentially how Global Thermostat’s system works, except it’s just pulling in air and separating out the CO2 for use in other products. The company has two innovations that allow it to slash the costs of an otherwise energy-intensive process, according to Eisenberger.

First, it uses a very thin air exchanger where ambient air is passed over a polymer that pulls out CO2. The exchanger’s narrowness — 65 times thinner than Carbon Engineering’s — means the air doesn’t have to flow as far, requiring less fan power (and thus less energy).

Add to that, Global Thermostat’s system requires only 185 degrees Fahrenheit to pry the CO2 molecules from the chemical that separates it. (That’s less heat than you need to boil water.) This allows the company to simply use recycled heat from its client’s facility to run the process. This last point is critical: There are huge amounts of heat wasted every day because industries don’t consider it hot enough to be useful. So Global Thermostat can take the leftover heat from creating, say, a giant vat of root beer and use it to make, well, in this case, more root beer.

Sustainable solution?

While soda bubbles and plastic bottles might not be the most sustainable end products, Global Thermostat’s deal is still a breakthrough.

First, these products would be made anyway. Now, they’re just produced with recycled CO2 as opposed to creating additional greenhouse gas.

Second, most new technologies fail in the transition from the lab to the marketplace, so scoring this client will ensure the financial viability of Global Thermostat and its technology. The company will be able to grow, continue to improve its technology, cut costs — and perhaps most important, demonstrate to the world that carbon capture can be done practically and profitably.

Eisenberger is confident that Global Thermostat will succeed because of these economic factors. While Global Thermostat’s current plant produces carbon dioxide at $150 per ton, the company is getting ready to build its next iteration, which he says reduces the cost to $100, a mere factor of two above its goal of $50. Consider that the costs of solar cells have come down by a factor of 100 since 1977, and you can see why the company is confident that they’ll hit their target.

And there’s good reason for that conviction. Following a proposal written in January 2018 by Chichilnisky, the latest federal budget contains a bipartisan law — the Furthering carbon capture, Utilization, Technology, Underground storage, and Reduced Emissions Act (or FUTURE Act) — which provides an unlimited tax credit of $35 per ton for carbon dioxide removed from air and utilized by an industrial facility. That rebate would bring Global Thermostat’s per-ton costs even closer to that $50 target.

Still, there are those who see direct-air capture as not really ready for prime time, especially when compared with options such as planting more trees, carbon farming, and sucking carbon out of fossil fuel plants’ smokestacks (another cost-intensive process that Global Thermostat can do with retrofits). The IPCC notes in its latest report that deploying the technology at a scale where it could contribute to keeping warming well below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit is “still a considerable challenge.”

“The thing about direct-air capture is that it’s one of the less technologically developed solutions out there,” says Matt Lucas, associate director of the Oakland, California-based nonprofit Carbon180 (formerly the Center for Carbon Removal). “It has quite high technology risk.”

The folks at Global Thermostat would disagree, and the market may soon prove them right.

Peter Eisenberger, who is now in his late-70s, has had a career that parallels the unfolding path of the modern energy industry. He’s played a role in its past, tried to move it into the future, and is now accounting for its excesses. He doesn’t have an unkind word to say about his former employer Exxon, and he’s quick to point out that fossil fuels were key in advancing human society to where it is today.

“Now we have to switch — it’s part of the natural evolution of our species,” Eisenberger explains. “We’re going to find a way to live sustainably and advance our economy at the same time.”","Global Thermostat is one of three companies that are pioneering the effort to make the challenging technology involved in direct air capture of carbon financially viable.

Hannah Jones/ hjones@sierasun.com

The race for Truckee Town Council’s three open seats is nearing an end with seven candidates focused on access to affordable housing, the town’s approaching General Plan update and how these issues will affect Truckee’s image as a small inclusive mountain town.

Challengers for the seats include Anna Klovstad, Truckee Elementary Project manager; David Polivy, owner of Tahoe Mountain Sports and current planning commissioner; Chelsea Walterscheid, program manager at Sierra Business Council; Suzie Tarnay, substitute teacher and Truckee Elementary School volunteer; Richard Ludke, Safety and Occupational Health Officer for Tahoe National Forest; Carmen Carr, Global Real Estate Advisor; and Morgan Goodwin, the sole incumbent on the ballot.

All candidates have expressed the need for immediate action to combat Truckee’s housing crisis with candidates Klovstad, Polivy, and Goodwin calling it the number one issue facing the town.

Tarnay suggests increasing the number of affordable housing units required by Truckee’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance from 15 percent to 25 percent, the same as Boulder, Colo. This would require one affordable unit for every four market rate unit. She also said she would look at increasing the in lieu housing fee.

“I’d like this fee to help cover the gap cost between affordable and market rate housing,” she said.

Candidate Carmen Carr also suggests looking at the fee structure and making adjustments in a way that will encourage developers to take on affordable housing projects. She also suggests implementing new measures to process housing permits more efficiently.

“I would continue the engagement of the many employers on this solution,” said Klovstad, adding that the town needs to work with homeowner associations and property owners to utilize housing that is already here but may be unoccupied.

“These are available now and we need them now,” she said. As a construction manager for the past three years, she said she understands the time it takes to develop, design, permit and build projects.

“We should set a goal of 1,000 new or unlocked units in five years to help focus land-use, development and funding decisions and measure our success,” said Goodwin. “That goal will allow us to make decisions about zoning, funding and prioritization more clearly.”

Walterscheid said the work ahead needs study to find solutions.

“In addition to the housing consultant the town currently works with, it is time for a dedicated staff person who will be 100 percent devoted to researching and understanding all the tools available at local, state, and federal levels,” said Walterscheid.

As short-term solutions Polivy suggests waiving certain fees for specific types of housing projects, adjusting the fee schedule to allow builders to repay the fees once the project is producing revenue and using zoning designations and densities as minimum requirements for projects. Long-term solutions include hiring a regional housing director, finding a way to fill the financial gap in affordable housing projects and increasing densities in where applicable, possibly at the Railyard. He also suggested working with HOAs to amend their regulations to allow for secondary-dwelling units.

“I’d like businesses to have the opportunity to build housing for their own employees,” said Ludke. “The town can help by staying out of their way.”

Ludke also suggested reducing fees and regulations that could deter developers from housing projects.

General Plan

The town’s anticipated growth and development has candidates looking toward the General Plan updates to address future development issues. While meant to be just an update, it could turn out to be a redesign.

“In the past year or two it has become abundantly clear that our General Plan update is going to need to be a full overhaul, not just a wording update,” said Tarnay. “The former general plan has excellent goals and ideals. These ideals just need to be solidified into numerical triggers and concrete action plans.”

“I think this General Plan update will be a significant update, just shy of a larger overhaul,” said Polivy. He said he is looking towards planning more proactively to increase densities in the downtown core. “It’s also an opportunity to revisit those sites in town that should remain green belts and open space to ensure our natural environment retains its character.”

Klovstad, who will be serving as the sustainability expert on the General Plan Advisory Committee said the update is her critical focus.

“This is where most of the community’s concerns will need to be addressed including housing. We need to do it right,” she said.

Carr said she will also be assisting in the update to control urban sprawl and incentivize quality development throughout the town.

“In 20 years, our community can be home to a vibrant, diverse workforce. It can run on renewable energy sources and be connected with safe bicycle trails, all while being faithful to our roots and culture,” she said.

Encouraging the development of bike trails to encourage alternate forms of transportation to lower the town’s greenhouse gas emissions are also priorities, Carr said.

“The General Plan process is very important right now and the process will be as comprehensive as it needs to be to take into account our changing economy, housing needs, growth patterns and values,” said Goodwin, who agreed the review could be more than just an update.

“The Town has done a good job so far in its relatively young municipal history,” said Walterscheid, who will also be serving on the General Plan Advisory Committee. “The community voice will help clarify and determine whether we move forward with an update or an overhaul.”

Ludke said the update should continue to work with zoning regulations and allow for higher densities instead of development sprawling outwards. He said parking will also be an issue to be studied.

“For any building we build, parking has to be a part of that equation,” Ludke said.

Q&A with the candidates

The Truckee Town Council is made up of five members, who each serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered between council members and elections are held every other year.

Carmen Carr

Carmen Carr has served on the board of the Family Resource Center of Truckee for the past 10 years serving as chair since 2014. She is a founding member of Mountain High Business Networking International, elected in 2011 as director for the regional BNI in Central Valley. She is also a member of Toastmasters International, an organization that promotes communication and leadership development, starting a local club named Truckee Talkers in 2011.

Why are you running for council?

I have lived in Truckee since 1986, observing change and transition. I am passionate about this community and envision achieving balanced well-being for our families and the future of our town. I am running for Truckee Town Council because I want our community members to be heard and have access to achievable housing, environmentally healthy transportation alternatives and renewable energy resources.

What is the most important issue facing Truckee?

I see three opportunities within the many significant issues that concern us as a community. I will advocate for achievable-housing opportunities, promote environmentally sound transportation alternatives and support conscientious adoption of renewable energy resources.

Morgan Goodwin

Morgan Goodwin was elected to the Truckee Town Council in 2014, serving once as vice mayor and once as mayor. He is the current chair of the Truckee Roundhouse makerspace and is an investor and future resident of the Truckee Cohousing Project. He also runs a small Burning Man camp and an annual Trail Magic event for Pacific Crest Trail hikers.

Why are you running for council?

Serving on council is the most rewarding work I’ve ever done. I’m running again because the things I believe in — greatly expanding local housing, a vibrant, walkable downtown for locals and visitors, 100 percent clean energy — are all in motion and we can make so much more progress with more positive, collaborative leadership.

What is the most important issue facing Truckee?

Local housing is by far the most important. Longtime residents are having to leave because they can’t find homes, and our businesses are suffering because they can’t hire good workers, even at good wages. I am calling for a goal of building or unlocking 1,000 new local, achievable units in the next five years.

Anna Klovsted

Anna Klovsted has served as the developer and manager for the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District Sustainability Program for 10 years. She serves as an executive board member for the School Energy Coalition, which advocates on behalf of energy and water efficiency in California’s K-14 schools. She volunteers annually at Truckee Clean Up Day, regularly at Truckee River Day and provides support to the Truckee River Watershed Council.

Why are you running for council?

For Truckee to remain the gem that it is we must plan a sustainable future. There is a path which will maintain the beauty of our hometown while keeping it vigorous and economically healthy. I am a sustainability specialist, a certified energy manager and a certified construction manager with 30 years’ experience. I live in and love Truckee. I am passionate about helping guide the General Plan update over the next two years, because it will be critical to the future of business interests and ecological concerns alike. There is a path to balance Truckee’s problems and promise, and my experience and commitment can help us build that future sustainably.

In your opinion, what is the most important issue facing Truckee?

Truckee may be a small town, but it is facing several complex issues. I feel the most important issue facing Truckee is the need to balance our divergent interests to achieve a Sustainable Future. We have to fight the urge to become polarized, pitting growth refusers and unrestricted development against each other. Truckee will not flourish unless we find a way for the entire community to realize we are in this together. So, the most important issue is not just to identify a problem, but to use facts and mutual respect to build — literally and figuratively — a better future for our town. My expertise is in bringing people of diverse views together. On Town Council, my experience with science and infrastructure coupled with compassionate leadership will be used to forge an economically viable and ecologically sound future for all of Truckee.

Richard Ludke

Richard Ludke currently works with the U.S. Forest Service and has volunteered for several years as a Big Brother of America, personal development mentor, at Truckee Clean Up and Truckee River Clean Up days, as well as helped with the local Food Bank and Rotary Club fundraising events.

Why are you running for council?

I am running for Town Council because I feel called to get involved in the decisions that are made for our Town, that will affect the lives of my neighbors, friends and family. I have no self-interest or political agenda, only to bring collaboration, respect for others, challenging thought, honesty, transparency and sound reasoning on all the issues we face in our community.

In your opinion, what is the most important issue facing Truckee?

I’d like to see us work with organized groups in the Region to bring on more local housing in the next 4 years, which includes low to moderate income levels. Truckee’s beauty defines us as a culture, I support organizations that are committed to protecting our lakes, rivers and forests. I like to see continued good efforts towards creating adequate parking plans for all future developments.

David Polivy

David Polivy is the founder and owner of Tahoe Mountain Sports, a founding member of California Outdoor Recreation Partners, a founding member of Tahoe Backcountry Alliance and has been serving on the Truckee Planning Commission for the past two years, as Jessica Abrams’ representative. He has served as the program manager at Sierra Business Council, on the Mountain Area Preservation Board, the North Tahoe Regional Advisory Council and the North Tahoe Business Association and currently serves on the Outdoor Industry Association Recreation Advisory Council.

Why are you running for council?

It’s all about passion and wanting to make the world, and more specifically, our community, the best place it can be. I want to provide leadership and work together to create and implement solutions to what I believe are the most pressing issues our community faces. I love making a difference and being involved in the decision-making process. I have the experience that I believe qualifies me to take the lead and position me to be an effective Council member. I think Truckee can be one of the most innovative, diverse and successful mountain communities in the country and I want to be one of the leaders that gets us there!

In your opinion, what is the most important issue facing Truckee?

The most important issue facing Truckee is twofold: housing and rate/how we grow. I will work diligently to pursue housing solutions that work for a variety of income levels in our community. Everybody should be able to afford a decent place to live. I have advocated for housing projects while on the Planning Commission and will continue to do so. I will also work to implement many of the recommendations coming out of the Mountain Housing Council work.

As far as the rate and type of growth Truckee is experiencing, I will work to make sure it is sustainable, focused on our town and community centers and is based on smart and common sense principles. The General Plan update will be an excellent opportunity for the community to tell the decision makers how they want our Town to grow and I will take many of those recommendations to the process. I will also work to ensure that we develop building for tenants that we actually need. I believe we need to identify the most important uses our community wants and then work hard to get projects on the ground reflecting those desires.

Suzie Tarnay

Suzie Tarnay works as a substitute teacher at Truckee Elementary, Alder Creek Middle School and Sierra Expeditionary Learning School, regularly volunteering at Truckee Elementary. She has served on the board of directors for the Yosemite National Park Child Care Center and was employee as a conservation assistant for the Truckee River Watershed Council in 2014. In addition, she is active in Lake Tahoe’s mountain bike and rock climbing communities.

Why are you running for council?

I love Truckee! Our town is filled with residents who are deeply invested in the mountain lifestyle, and that makes for a strong sense of community. I want to be a part of preserving the aspects of our town that make us proud to call it our home. I want to help seek improvements and solutions to issues that are challenges for Truckee right now. Additionally, I have found that I enjoy and have an affinity for the public service process. My civil engineering background and the fact that I am a naturally social individual fulfill two sides of the public service coin. I like to dig into the numbers, and I also enjoy talking to fellow community members and listening to their views. We, as a whole, are a highly educated and street-smart population. I know together we can take on the toughest challenges.

In your opinion, what is the most important issue facing Truckee?

Affordable housing is the most pressing issue Truckee faces today. We are losing our hardworking families to more affordable locations and broadening our carbon footprint in the process. Last November, I spoke at a Town Council meeting to point out the conundrum that our Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requires 15 percent of new housing to be “affordable,” yet our in-lieu fee only requires a 3 percent monetary investment. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers when it comes to big-ticket items like housing construction. I hope to build upon the research conducted by the Mountain Housing Council and not only search for out-of-the-box solutions, but also put in the hard work and monetary investment that a problem of this nature requires.

Chelsea Walterscheid

Chelsea Walterscheid was raised in Truckee and has volunteered for multiple organizations in the area including leading and coordinating local events such as Truckee Day, the Old Timers’ Picnic and Truckee Thursdays. She was an inaugural member of the Truckee Citizens Waste Management Advisory Committee and past trustee of the Truckee Cemetery District. She also sat on the Truckee-Donner Historical Society Board for 20 years and on the Church of the Mountains Preschool Board.

Why are you running for council?

I believe in public service and am a very proud resident of a town that people care deeply about. My extensive experience in the community brings a perspective of someone who knows multiple facets of our community, including “old” and “new” ideas. At the end of the day, I want to represent Truckee residents in the best way I can.

In your opinion, what is the most important issue facing Truckee?

Affordability. Truckee was once a blue-collar, working-class town that has evolved into a high-end resort area. Affordability is relevant to every member of our community and I look forward to addressing issues that will retain a small town quality of life that accommodates all of our residents for generations to come.

Austin-based construction tech startup ICON has raised $9 million in a seed round of funding.

The company aims to reinvent building affordable homes with the use of “3D-printers, robotics, and advanced materials,” according to its website. CEO Jason Ballard noted the company is motivated by the global housing crisis and a lack of solutions.

“Making old approaches a little better is not solving the problem,” Ballard said. “It’s our mission at ICON to re-imagine the approach to homebuilding and construction and make affordable, dignified housing available to everyone throughout the world. The homebuilding industry needs a complete paradigm shift.”

Some high-profile investors are attempting to fuel that shift. San Francisco-based Oakhouse Partners led the seed financing, which also included participation from Vulcan Capital—the investment arm of the late Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen; homebuilder D.R. Horton; Emaar—one of the largest developers in the Middle East and creator of the tallest building in the world; and Austin-based accelerator Capital Factory.

Investor Jason Portnoy, managing partner at Oakhouse Partners and former early executive at PayPal and Palantir Technologies (who has also invested in startups such as SpaceX, Carta and Zipline), is extremely bullish on ICON.

“What the ICON team has accomplished in such a short period of time is not only a transformational breakthrough in homebuilding, it is an inspiration for the entire world to think outside the box about how humanity will confront the global housing crisis,” he said in a written statement. “Oakhouse Partners invests in companies that apply innovative technologies to radically improve millions of lives. ICON demonstrates this perfectly through their advanced construction technologies, and we’re proud to support them on this important mission.”

And that big mission has small designs.

One Brick At A Time

Earlier this year, ICON and non-profit partner New Story unveiled the first 3D-printed home in the U.S. to receive a building permit at SXSW. The 350-square foot house took about 48 hours (at 25 percent speed) to print at a cost of about $10,000 (although today it would cost about $4,000), according to Jason Ballard, co-founder and CEO of ICON. Construction of the home ended up having more than one purpose. Besides essentially serving as the company’s first prototype, it ended up being a proof of concept for investors.

“Completing that home validated what we’re doing for the investor community. One week before SXSW, there wasn’t a house,” Ballard said. “Then there was a house. We showed we can attract customers as we develop our technology. Our goal in coming years is to be able to print a 1,500 to 2,000 square foot home in about 16 hours.”

ICON deliberately chose to build the house inside the city limits of Austin to prove to people that the technology was ready and could pass the same safety and regulatory requirements that any other building could pass, noted Ballard.

Up until this point, ICON was bootstrapped by its three co-founders. The seed round was slightly oversubscribed but as Ballard told Crunchbase News, “The questions you need to ask and the experiments you need to run to get a giant robot ready for scale are a very different game than building a software startup, for example.”

The company plans to use the funds toward further scaling its technology. ICON expects to launch the second generation of its Vulcan printer sometime in the first half of 2019, according to Ballard. ICON also plans to double its staff from 10 to 20 by year’s end and move into a new lab and office.

ICON Gets Concrete

At some point, we’ve got to break the doom cycle

Next up on ICON’s agenda is to deliver strategic, signature projects in the U.S. and abroad, including continued work with nonprofit New Story. New Story’s goal is to print a community of homes for an underserved population in 2019 with each home being around 600-800 square feet. These homes are estimated to cost about $4,000. More “Americanized” homes will cost closer to $30,000, according to Ballard.

ICON’s mobile printer weighs about 2,000 pounds, fully prints on-site, and does not require printing in an off-site location. The entire home is printed seamlessly and produces nearly zero waste and is highly durable, low maintenance, and energy-efficient to operate, according to ICON.

The company currently has an “overflow” of demands and requests for houses, including building homes for “Middle America.” Investors D.R. Horton and Emaar, for example, are eager to deploy the technology and collaborate on “very innovative housing projects,” Ballard said.

ICON purposely chose concrete as a material because, as Ballard puts it, “It’s one of the most resilient materials on Earth.”

“Concrete is an exceptional performer against flood, fire, wind, mold or insects that could undermine the long-term performance of houses or their life span,” he told Crunchbase News. “It can build a cheap, fast, and better product, and we developed a proprietary formula that is unique for our current and future printing projects. My hometown on the Texas Gulf Coast was destroyed by hurricanes two times. We keep spending billions to put houses back together with the same non-resilient materials. At some point, we’ve got to break the doom cycle.”

Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Groupe Renault, presented the new vehicle:

“Groupe Renault was a pioneer and is the European leader in electric vehicles. We are introducing Renault K-ZE, an affordable, urban, SUV-inspired electric model combining the best of Groupe Renault: our leadership in EV, our expertise in affordable vehicles and in forging strong partnerships”,

The French automaker announced the vehicle as being “affordable”, but didn’t release any pricing information.

More information will be available when the vehicle is released next year.

They first plan to make it available in China and Europe will follow a year later.

The only spec that they confirmed is the range, which they claim is 250 km (155 miles), but they used the NEDC cycle for some reason:

“A pioneer and leader in 100% electric mobility, Groupe Renault unveiled showcar Renault K-ZE, a new global A-segment, SUV-inspired electric vehicle, capable of 250km NEDC – the best autonomy in its segment.”

We expect the real world range to be close to 190 km (118 miles).

Here are a few images of the show car Renault K-ZE unveiled today ahead of the production version next year:

Electrek’s Take

We often say that electric vehicle range is not as big of a deal that most people make it out to be. The average commute is 30 miles and therefore, 100 miles of range is good enough to replace a lot of gas mileage.

That said, launching a new EV in 2019-2020 with less than 200 miles of range is a strange bet.

When Renault says that the vehicle is “affordable”, they better mean it. It better not be a $30,000+ vehicle for that size and options.

I think if they can hit something around 20,000 euros (~$24,000 USD), it might work out for them.

The ZOE would be more expensive and smaller, but it has a much greater range than the new K-ZE.

150,https://thebrag.com/affordable-housing-australia/,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Brag Magazine,What to know about affordable housing in Australia,"Everyone deserves access to safe and affordable housing. In an increasingly challenging private rental market, it’s important to be aware of the support you are able to receive with regards to subsidised and affordable housing.

Watch a clip on affordable housing in Australia below

FACS defines affordable housing as accommodation that meets the needs of people on very low to moderate incomes – priced in a way that they are able to afford other basic living costs such as food and clothing.

In New South Wales and many other states, affordable housing is typically managed by not-for-profit community housing providers or private organisations. The funding of many affordable housing properties has been under the National Rental Affordability Scheme, a program which aims to reduce rental costs for low to medium income households and increase the number of more affordable rental houses.

The NRAS household income limits are a good general guide to whether you are eligible for affordable housing. Other factors which may affect eligibility include whether you are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia, whether or not you’d be reasonably able to secure adequate housing in the private, and whether you can show you’re able to maintain successful tenancy.

So how much am I going to have to pay?

According to FACS, there are two ways in which the amount of rent you will be required to pay is set.

The first is as a discount of current market rent, usually around 20-25% below market rent. “Where amount is set this way, the amount you pay will depend on the market rent for a similar property in the same area”.

The second way is setting rent as proportionate to a household’s income before tax – with households being charged between 25-30% of their income before tax for rent.

Typically, affordable housing tenants are required to enter a fixed term lease, and you will need to remain eligible for subsidised housing the whole time you are under that agreement. While still eligible for affordable housing, the lease can usually be renewed and continued.

It’s a use case that many of the Kona Electrics Hyundai sells in the U.S. are likely to encounter. The company sees about 80 percent of the current U.S. market for EVs such as the Kona Electric in California, and company officials described a pecking order to it: California first (in January 2019), then the rest of CARB ZEV states, and then the rest of the nation. But in this year that Tesla is leading sales of all-electric models to new highs, it’s a travesty for Hyundai to limit it to what sounds, at the start, like a compliance machine—especially for a vehicle that, based on our preliminary impressions, is this good.

CHECK OUT: 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric rated at class-leading 258 miles of range

As you scan downward in this first drive report, there are a couple things we really can’t comment about yet: pricing, which won’t be detailed for a little while, and the Kona Electric’s 258-mile driving range, which is the most currently EPA-rated for any non-Tesla model. Our drive route included a lot of elevation changes, and we finished our drive of the Kona Electric at a lower elevation than where we started. It wasn’t surprising that the range estimator adjusted upward.

The Kona Electric instantly strikes us as a more “normal” vehicle than its obvious cross-shop rival, the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Both are price-conscious electric crossover-hatches with mammoth “skateboard” battery packs stocked with LG Chem cells (pouch for the Bolt EV, prismatic for the Kona Electric). The Hyundai is slightly lower and wider than the Bolt EV, but it rides on an identical 102.4-inch wheelbase and 164.0-inch overall length.

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

Cabin priorities are starkly different between these two, though. For instance, even though the Bolt EV has about three inches more rear legroom by the official numbers, the Kona Electric feels more spacious in back because its sides don’t taper as aggressively upward—revealed by the Kona’s nearly two-inch advantage in rear shoulder room. Lift the hatch and you get the same cargo capacity as in gasoline versions, and the 60/40-split rear seatbacks flip forward to a flat floor

DON'T MISS: 5 things about the 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

It’s easy to get in and get comfortable in the Kona Electric. Seats aren’t as high as most SUVs and crossovers, and there’s plenty of headroom. The front ones are more generously padded than in the Bolt EV, and the lower seat cushions are longer, for more thigh support—a big difference for this tall driver.

Gas gone electric—but you might not know

While there’s no gasoline Bolt EV, there is a gasoline Kona, and it’s one of the finest (and newest) specimens of the compact crossover class—neither conceived to look too outdoorsy nor aiming too far afield in design. To take it electric, Hyundai gave it a smoothing-over that makes the whole design a whole lot less busy than the gas model, but carried the rest of the goodness forward. The sharp squint of the headlamps are the most overt aspect of the design; otherwise the Kona feels a bit like a stylish hatchback car that’s gone sans serif and sans italics. Cargo space is abundant, rear seatbacks fold flat, and there are none of the sore compromises that can call out a compliance car [whether it is or not, well, we’ll get to that].

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

Hyundai has added what it calls a “bridge-type center console with high-tech image.” Translation: With shifting between Park, Reverse, Neutral, and Drive performed by four big buttons replacing the traditional shift lever (with the parking-brake toggle just behind), there’s a lot more space freed up for a large storage area below.

A drive mode button, important to note, is also atop the bridge. There are three primary charge modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport, each with a different calibration for how the accelerator and steering boost respond. Hold down the button for a few seconds and you’ll get to a fourth, Eco+, which essentially just cuts out the climate control.

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

Out on the open road (yes, we did get some of that, too), the Kona Electric feels very perky, with its permanent-magnet motor delivering 201 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque. Even if the calibration doesn’t make it feel quite as uproariously enthusiastic and tire-burning as the Bolt EV off the line Hyundai says it has the same 7.6-second acceleration to 60 mph. The Kona Electric can reach a top speed of 104 mph versus the Bolt EV’s 90.

As we zigzagged on canyon two-laners, the Kona Electric really underscored the car side of the equation. It feels sporty and more balanced—likely the result of a better weight distribution and lower center of mass, even though it likely can’t muster as many Gs in corners as those other versions on its low-rolling-resistance tires. The Kona Electric gets an upgrade to a trailing-arm independent suspension, replacing the torsion-beam setup in the gasoline Kona, plus a front subframe bushing and hollow stabilizer bar, so that may help with the impression.

The best brake-regen functionality yet?

There are three levels of regenerative braking in the Kona Electric—0, 1, 2, and 3, with 3 being the most aggressive and 0 being freewheeling/coast mode. The car defaults to 1 for Normal and Sport modes and 2 for Eco, and you can click up the regen with the left paddle or down with the right paddle. But here’s where it all gets interesting: It doesn’t have to be that way. Hyundai has smartly decided to make those default levels of regen for each drive mode customizable via menus on the instrument cluster. So if you set the default to 3, you can get a strong almost-one-pedal level of regen every time you get in.

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

Doing a longer pull on the left paddle serves two purposes. Do it as you’re coasting down and it enables the system’s maximum brake regen of 0.25g (a slight step more than ‘3’). Or do it as you’re gradually slowing to a stop and it disables creep, allowing you to gently (the operative word) reach a stop without pressing the brake pedal, until you start back up. It’s almost one-pedal driving.

A smart regeneration mode uses the radar sensors from the adaptive cruise system to automatically adjust your regen mode up or down. We did try this system, which engages via vehicle-configuration menus on the instrument cluster, for a short distance and couldn’t fully understand what it was doing in traffic and why. We’ll update you in the future, over a longer drive on familiar roads.

One other impression held every step of the way: This is a very quiet vehicle inside. With acoustic glass for the windshield and front side windows to help keep wind whoosh out, a suite of underbody covers and deflectors that double in keeping road noise away, and any motor whine well-muted, the only thing that finds its way into the cabin at city speeds is the intergalactic whir of Hyundai’s low-speed pedestrian warning.

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

Hyundai has, through all these wind-cheating measures (the active front fascia included), cut the coefficient of drag to a low 0.29. That may play a part in the Kona Electric’s MPGe ratings of 120 combined (132 city, 108 highway)—versus 112 combined (125 city, 100 highway) for the Nissan Leaf.

Charging: light and fast, with thoughtful controls

The big pack is liquid-cooled and uses LG Chem prismatic cells; the entire battery system weighs less than 1,000 pounds, and by weight the pack’s energy density is 141.3 wh/kg—better than that of the Bolt EV, which uses LG Chem pouch cells. In terms of total curb weight, the Kona Electric weighs only slightly more than a top-trim gasoline model (about 3,400 pounds).

2019 Hyundai Kona Electric

DC fast charging is standard on all versions of the Kona Electric (it points out, rightly so, that’s not the case for the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Nissan Leaf). It lists 9 hours and 35 minutes as the charge time at Level 2, using the AC onboard charger rated at 7.2 kw. And for cold weather, a battery warming feature helps speed up slower charging. A Hyundai official did not care to cite an official time for Level 1 (120V) AC charging, suggesting (as the numbers do) that it would take most of a weekend.

If you can find any of the latest 100-kw or 150-kw DC fast charging stations, the Kona Electric is (somewhat) ready to take advantage of the added power. With either, the big 64-kwh pack can regain up to 80 percent in just 54 minutes. Hyundai now specifies that translates to a power of 70 kw—or in Ohm’s Law napkin math, 71.2 kw, as the system draws a maximum of 200 amps at its 356 volts.

The Kona Electric comes with straightforward features for charge scheduling and charging limits—like being able to set the maximum percentage for AC or DC fast charging with a simple slider on the touch screen. All models come with three years of Blue Link telematics services that link with Google Home and allow app-based features like remote start, remote lock/unlock, climate preconditioning, destination voice search, a car finder, and remote management of charging. Some of these features can be managed with Android Wear devices and Apple Watch apps.

Between SEL, Limited, and Ultimate, you get the same battery size, performance, and charging speed. The difference is mainly whether you find certain safety or convenience features critical. The SEL comes with heated front seats, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, and a suite of safety systems (forward collision warning, blind-spot warning, driver attention warning). Limited models add a moonroof, power driver’s seat, and Qi wireless charging, among other extras, and the Ultimate is the way to go for the top 8-inch infotainment and Infinity audio, plus a flip-up head-up display, rain-sensing wipers, ventilated front seats, and a heated steering wheel.

The Ultimate also includes adaptive cruise control, and those sensors are put to use with forward collision avoidance (with pedestrian detection) and the smart regenerative-braking mode.

A few shorts in the long game

One surprise is that the Kona Electric won’t include a heat pump, which can in some climates improve driving range by up to 20 percent (so say suppliers) by reducing the amount of resistive heating needed.

One turnoff was the legibility of the instrument-panel theme, which subs in thin gray lettering on matte-metallic button faces and proved challenging at some angles on a bright, sunny day. Perhaps it’s better at night, but we wished they’d just kept with the gasoline models’ white lettering on black buttons.

There’s really little else to quibble about here. Perhaps the most grievous misstep is its limited availability. Hyundai officials confessed that part of the reason behind that is how the U.S. is being allocated fewer Kona Electrics than it knows it can sell. It’s working on that.

At first look, what we see is quite the sweet spot to win over new electric-vehicle drivers. If shoppers still unsure about EVs actually see the Kona Electric at dealership lots, the performance, driving range, and thoughtful features—with the affordability Hyundai has suggested—may altogether be the convincing argument they’ve been waiting for.

City officials are also monitoring the condition of existing affordable housing like the Lake Arbor Apartments in west Charlotte, where inspectors found numerous code violations.

Residents have complained of mold, roaches, sewage back-ups and summertime air conditioning failures. Mayor Vi Lyles said the Lake Arbor complex is an important piece of the city’s affordable housing stock.

The 296-unit apartment complex sits just off of Tuckaseegee Road next to large, single-family homes. Those homes are a big contrast to Lake Arbor’s worn-looking apartments that line streets filled with big potholes, uncut grass, trash in places and many unit windows covered with cardboard.

Janice Williams has lived at Lake Arbor for six years in two different buildings.

""Down there was roaches,” Williams said. “The pipe under my sink was busted and I had to keep getting a wet vac to vacuum. My floor was soaked. And up here I never had air for two-and-a-half years.”

Williams said she pays $650 a month for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her adult daughter. She said her complaints to management went unanswered until city officials learned about the condition of the complex and sent in code inspectors.

“They put a new window in her room, and did my bathroom floor and they painted, but I've been here three years and they're just now doing this stuff when the City of Charlotte got on it,” Williams said. “They haven’t done anything about the mold. They painted, but it's still gonna be there.”

Others who complained about mold in their units also said bleach or other products were not used to get rid of the mold, and that it was simply painted over.

Andre Thompson has lived at Lake Arbor for two years. He said he has had issues with mold, but his worst problem has been sewage backups.

“They fixed it in five or six days, but it happened again and it was much worse,” Thompson said. “The bathroom — you couldn’t use it. The sewage came out the toilet. It was creeping close to my furniture in the bedroom so I got all my stuff out.”

Thompson said the air conditioning does not work in the unit he’s in now.

A security guard at the leasing office said management had no comment and I was asked to leave. We were referred to the apartment complex’s attorneys. They did not respond to several phone messages and emails.

Last week, the city’s code enforcement manager Ben Christ made a presentation before the City Council on his department’s findings after inspecting all of Lake Arbor’s units in September.

“Some other common violations that we found were broken door jambs, unclean and unsanitary conditions, inoperable smoke detectors, some exposed electrical wiring, some face plates removed, damaged plumbing, damaged and unsanitary floor covering, rotting window sill and exterior lighting that’s broken,” Christ said.

Credit Gwendolyn Glenn / Residents complain about uncut grass, air conditioners that don't work, mold and sewage backups.

Christ said tenants in nine apartments had to be relocated elsewhere because the conditions were so bad. He said most of the apartments failed inspections and 262 units are still being monitored. Christ said the city’s involvement has led to a couple of decks being rebuilt, some mechanical and HVAC systems being repaired and safety locks were placed on sliding doors. He said the housing code does not cover mold, but adds that there are ways they can make landlords clean it up.

“Mold manifests itself in other unsanitary conditions — in water-related violations as well as ventilation-related violations,” Christ said. “We do look at all of the components of HVAC and under the mechanical code we address mold. Our ordinance allows us to address those issues.”

City officials say Lake Arbor is a key piece of Charlotte’s affording housing strategy. The supply is about 24,000 units short of demand. Mayor Pro Tem Julie Eiselt said they want the owners to bring the complex into compliance so it won’t have to be shut down.

“That’s a big complex, rents are starting in the $600s and there’s not a lot of that out there,” Eiselt said. “It’s very difficult in this day and age to build apartments that rent at that kind of level without some kind of subsidy. That’s why you’d hate to lose that kind of stock.”

Residents at Lake Arbor say they are not just concerned about the poor condition of their units, but safety is an issue as well. They tell stories of shootings, drug deals, stabbings and murders occurring at the complex.

“The first night we were here, my sister [and I] were sitting on the balcony and my sister ran in the house and she said people are shooting outside,” the tenant said. “A guy came around the corner with a gun that was huge and I said, 'This is where we moved to. This is all I can afford right now but as quick as I can, I’m moving.'”

The tenant is a nursing student. She’s lived at Lake Arbor for five years and pays $900 in rent. She did not want to give her name because she said she knows of others being served with eviction notices after talking to the media or demanding repairs.

“Evicting a tenant in response to a tenant making a complaint about repairs to the landlord or to the City of Charlotte is a retaliatory eviction, and that is completely illegal under North Carolina laws,” said Isaac Sturgill, the supervising attorney for the housing unit at Legal Aid in Charlotte.

Sturgill is representing several tenants in cases against Lake Arbor. His office also did a presentation for residents on their rights — letting them know that things such as rat infestations, unsafe wiring and appliances such as air conditioners that do not work are violations of the city’s housing code.

“If the landlord is aware that one of those imminently dangerous conditions exist on the property and refusing to fix it, it is unlawful for landlord to collect any rent while that condition is still present on the property,” Sturgill said.

Sturgill represented Tonya Burris in her case against Lake Arbor. Burris, a school bus driver, lived there for a year with her husband and children in an apartment that had mold and was without air conditioning. Her rent was $925. She said her children with asthma ended up in the emergency room because of the mold. Burris complained to city officials about that and the lack of exterior lighting. She said soon afterwards, she faced an eviction for money they did not owe.

""I went to them because I had to be at work at five in the morning and it is dark outside,” Burris said. “Under the stairs I had to go down, it was pitch black. So, I felt it was a retaliatory eviction because we called the city on them. They didn’t know that we had copies of all of our money orders and a copy of the email where they accepted the money.”

Burris won her eviction case and the family now lives in a home they bought in Gastonia.

City officials say they have a team of inspectors at Lake Arbor daily to ensure that repairs are being made according to city codes. On Nov. 6, code enforcement officials are taking the complex’s owners to court to get the fixes they want in 11 Lake Arbor units.","City officials are also monitoring the condition of existing affordable housing like the Lake Arbor Apartments in west Charlotte, where inspectors found numerous code violations.

“AI will offer new tools to help multinational and local companies deepen their understanding of consumers’ needs and aspirations,”​ said the report.

“Algorithmic persuasion will also lead consumers in lower income (and all) markets toward healthier and more economical consumption habits.”​

Commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the examination into AI’s potential includes real-life examples of the technology in action.

It cited biotech company Nuritas, founded in 2014, as using AI, deep learning, and genomics to predict and provide access to food-derived peptides.

Earlier this year, Nuritas collaborated with food giants Nestlé​​ to deploy their technology platform to identify peptides from natural sources. The technology then validates the efficacy of those discoveries within target food applications.

“The traditional approach to finding new active molecules is close to random, it’s like searching the ocean for a treasure chest without a map. It usually takes years and millions,”​ said Nora Khaldi, Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Nuritas. “What the Nuritas technology does is create a map​.”​

“Our data-driven approach powered by machine learning enables us to progress through the development cycle at incredibly fast rates at all stages from in vitro to as far as scaling of ingredient production,”​ ​ added Emmet Browne, CEO at Nuritas.

Big data expectations ​

The report honed in on current challenges for food companies to better target lower-income consumers identifying a lack of high-resolution population data – an issue that big data analytics, when combined with AI could provide “a powerful lens on lower-income consumers at population, community, and individual levels”.​

“Much of the developing world is leapfrogging the path of development that we have in the developed world,”​ according to AI expert and entrepreneur De Kai in an interview conducted for the report.

“They may be under the radar and they may have trouble with even clean running water, but everybody is getting these smartphones and getting online.”​

In another data-dependent opportunity, the report also looked to advances made in microbiota management and microbe-friendly diets for optimum health.

While the authors acknowledged the relative immaturity of the area, they recognised the opportunities that await for food companies to design microbe-friendly and microbiota-directed foods (MDFs).

In a nod to personalised nutrition, MDFs would focus on a consumer’s microbiome to enable positive long-term nutrition outcomes, benefiting the undernourished and malnourished, which includes lower-income consumers.

Market research ​

According to industry analysis​​, the personalised nutrition market is expected to grow from €82bn ($93bn) in 2015 to €112bn ($127bn) in 2020.

This steady growth of the personalised nutrition market opens up opportunities to personalise microbes for food and beverage applications.

Probiotics in particular market is expected to grow from €40.12bn ($45.64bn) in 2017 to €56.30bn ($64.02bn) by 2022, primarily driven by heightened consumer awareness of the health benefits of probiotic consumption.

Analysts​​ believe Asia-Pacific will become the fastest-growing region as consumers in countries like China and Japan increase the probiotics in their daily diets.

European efforts to promote next-generation probiotics at the commercial scale include DuPont Nutrition and Health’s partnership​​ with Estonia’s Center of Food and Fermentation Technologies (TFTAK).

The collaboration will develop cultivation techniques and bioprocesses that will produce next-generation probiotics at scale.

This partnership also focuses on the mother-infant microbiome, the gut-brain axis, and infant nutrition in order to create nutritious fermented foods and beverages.

Combining personalisation and the gut​

Israeli-based firm DayTwo look to offer personalised nutrition services based on the gut microbiome.

The service combines the two disciplines by analysing an individual’s microbiome to predict blood sugar responses to thousands of different foods creating personalised nutrition recommendations to maintain a normal blood sugar level throughout the day.

With a stool sample, a short questionnaire, and a simple glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) blood test, DayTwo clinicians are able to sequence the DNA of a gut microbiome and produce a unique nutrition profile that suggests foods to keep the gut, and therefore the body, healthy.

Among the report’s insights into how microbiota management could translate into affordable nutrition, it said, “as everyone’s microbiome is unique, microbe-friendly foods will create a new need for personalised nutrition ingredients, products, and business models”.​

“Striking the right balance of individual-, family-, and community level personalisation will be critical.”​

The report added that there would be the need to create more personalised nutrition offerings that would give food companies a chance to create deeper ongoing relationships with consumers in place of more singular transactions.

“Moving from transactions to relations in order to support microbe-friendly foods in the marketplace can help companies build a larger base of loyal customers.”​","While the authors acknowledged the relative immaturity of the area, they recognised the opportunities that await for food companies to design microbe-friendly and microbiota-directed foods (MDFs).

Design

While traditional wireless earbuds usually consist of a pair of earbuds attached to a thicker control/battery unit, the BlitzWolf BW-ANC1 earphones, at a glance, almost look like a pair of wired earbuds. The battery/control unit is about 1-inch square and half-an-inch thick with a clip on the back. On one side is the covered Micro-USB charging port and a button to toggle active noise cancelling on or off. Save The main control unit with Micro-USB charging port and ANC button toggle.

The front side is soft and rubbery and has three slightly raised symbols on it: a small circle (volume down/previous track), infinity symbol (multi-function button) in the middle, and a larger circle (volume up/next track) on the other side. From the control unit is a braided cable roughly 10-inches long which then splits into the right and left earbud. To the right of the cable is an LED light to indicate if the ANC is on or off.

Each earbud cable is also about 10-inches in length. Instead of being braided, however, they are the classic rubber coated cables. On the right cable about 3-inches up is a solid aluminum microphone enclosure. Each cable attaches to the earbuds which are housed in a flattened cone-type aluminum enclosure. At the base of this cylinder is an L or an R to indicate which ear the earbud goes in. The eartips themselves attach to the earbuds on a metal piece that is angled slightly forward. Save The BlitzWolf BW-ANC1 earbuds.

The design and fit is pretty comfortable and given the number of eartip sizes included, it should be easy to get the correct fit rather easily. It is odd though that the earphones are a mix of aluminum, braided cable, and coated cables.

The include case is semi-hard shelled, oval in shape, and features a zipper around the middle. When opened, there is a small mesh ouch for your extra eartips and charging cable while the other side is fully open and the earbuds fit nicely inside. Save The headphones come with a carrying case.

Ease of Use

As with most wireless Bluetooth earphones these days, the BlitzWolf BW-ANC1 are pretty easy to use. When first turned on by pressing the MFB for two seconds, the earphones will enter Bluetooth mode. Search for BW-ANC1 on your smartphone and press it to pair with your device.

The controls are equally easy to use. The MFB lets you play/pause the current track, answer, hang up, or ignore a call, toggle mute while in a call, as well as the previously mentioned powering on/off and pairing. The large and small circle buttons allow you to adjust volume or skip tracks. To toggle ANC, simply tap the button. When toggled on, the LED will shine white, when off the LED will not be lit.

Sound Quality

When testing more affordable earphones, there’s always a bit of apprehension when it comes to first trying them out as far as sound quality is concerned. I have to admit, I was impressed with the sound quality the BW-ANC1 produced — both with ANC enabled and disabled. Highs, mids, and lows are nicely balanced without needing to rely on your smartphone’s equalizer. In fact, this is one rare case where I found enabling the equalizer on the Pixel 2 XL made the audio sound more muddied. I love a bit more bass and with these, and I found the bass line was almost perfect without being overpowering.

Reception/Call Quality

As the design mirrors traditionally wired earbuds, with the wires hanging down in front of you, the placement of the microphone is in an optimum position in front of your mouth as opposed to the side or slightly behind as with some other designs. During our test calls, the microphone and call quality on the BW-ANC1 earphones was clear and crisp.

On the reception side of things, I was able to walk anywhere at home and still be able to hear the music streaming to the earphones. In a more open setting, I was able to get around 60 feet from my phone before the signal started to degrade which is pretty great as far as wireless headphones go.

Battery Life

One area where wireless earbuds are still striving to improve upon is battery life. BlitzWolf claims between 5-7 hours of battery life depending on if ANC is active or not. During testing, we were able to get around 5 hours of battery with ANC active, which is pretty decent as far as wireless earbuds go. When tested with ANC disabled, we did get closer to the 7 hour mark.

When depleted, the earbuds take about an hour-and-a-half to fully recharge.

Price/Value

With an MSRP of $49.99USD, the BlitzWolf BW-ANC1 earphones are a very good deal considering the sound quality and the fact that they come with active noise cancelling .

Wrap-up

Odd design and material mix aside, the BlitzWolf BW-ANC1 offer excellent sound with ANC and decent battery life for the price.

159,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-energy-become-secure-affordable-and-sustainable-sector-transforms,"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,"Can energy become secure, affordable and sustainable as the sector transforms?","Energy is at the root of modern economies and is vital to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the internet of things. The challenge for policymakers is to craft policy frameworks that enable the three critical goals of energy security, environmental sustainability and affordability and access while the energy sector undergoes a fundamental transition.

Maintaining a balance between these three goals creates a ""trilemma,"" which is getting more complex for countries and energy companies — especially given the uncertain pace of the transition to decentralized, decarbonized and digital systems. Put differently, we are trying to build a bridge while crossing it.

The comparative rankings and profiles of the 125 economies covered in the World Energy Trilemma Index 2018 highlight how the exponential acceleration of interconnected megatrends shaping the global energy sector are rapidly evolving the means to achieve and balance energy trilemma goals.

Energy security

Evolving energy sources are shifting the definition of and means by which to achieve energy security. In a fossil fuel-driven world, energy security was ensured by the security of energy supply. But technology has led to an increased supply of natural gas and has driven improved performance and reduced costs of renewables. Today’s energy security increasingly implies flexibility of a diversified grid, which is hard to measure and even harder to ensure.

For example, coal-fired electricity generation in OECD countries is in terminal decline. Initially displaced by cleaner natural gas, it has been increasingly losing ground to renewable sources that continue to grow faster than predicted: The share of renewable generation has doubled every 5.5 years. Under these trends, coal-fired power and nuclear no longer will be viable sources of power in OECD countries by 2050. For example, in the United States, the share of electricity generated from coal dropped from 52.8 percent in 1997 to 45 percent in 2009, and then to 30.1 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the share of natural gas in 2017 stood at 31.7 percent, and the share of renewables was at 17.1 percent.

Today’s energy security increasingly implies flexibility of a diversified grid, which is hard to measure and even harder to ensure. On this trajectory, by 2050, up to 90 percent of OECD generation will be from renewables. The IEA predicts that the share of all renewables in total global power generation will be 40 percent by 2040 [PDF].

Looking outside the OECD, coal as a percentage of total electricity generation is expected to remain high in the near term. For example, coal is on track to grow to 75 percent in India by 2027 and to 56 percent in Indonesia in the near term.

However, China may be indicative of future trends in other countries that hope to balance energy security, increased energy access and environmental sustainability. Coal is on track to drop to 56 percent of total energy generation in China — from 80 percent in 2007, as China continues its focus on increasing renewables.

Fossil fuels are also affected by the movement to divest from fossil fuel [PDF], which has grown 11,900 percent from $52 billion assets under management four years ago to over $6 trillion today, with nearly 1,000 institutional investors pledging to divest from coal, oil and gas. This trend is likely to have increasing impacts beyond OECD countries in upcoming years.

Along with this, investment in clean energy has grown at 14 percent CAGR over the past 10 years.

Access and affordability

Decentralization and democratization of the energy system will shift the definition of energy access and affordability.

The adoption of renewable generation, distributed energy resources (DER), deployment of smart grids, energy storage solutions and electrification of transport are just some trends transforming the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Supplies of ever-cheaper mainstream wind and solar power are driving down wholesale electricity prices. The expansion of renewables is expected to further drive growth in battery storage capacity and subsequently decrease installation costs, further disrupting the traditional model of centralized power generation and distribution. Many incumbent utilities companies in Western countries are struggling to adapt, as their business models are perceived as in decline. They soon may be replaced by potentially new business models from challenger companies.

Decentralization and democratization of the energy system will shift the definition of energy access and affordability. Under these forces, Europe will see a mostly decentralized and highly democratized energy system by 2040. Elsewhere, DER is creating new opportunities for low-income economies to provide secure, reliable and affordable energy through mini- or microgrids.

The number of residential and industrial ""prosumers"" — those who both consume and produce electricity — at a local level is already rising. They soon will play a far more active role in the energy system as a whole as they look to manage energy costs and the sources of their energy, enabled by evolving technologies such as blockchain.

For example, in September, Apple, Akamai, Etsy and Swiss Re leveraged their collective buying power jointly to purchase renewable energy in the U.S. PJM energy market with the largest aggregated corporate renewable energy transaction to date.

Environmental sustainability

Shifts in electricity generation and transportation fuels will help meet energy sustainability goals, and the energy transition will change the economics of the oil and gas industry. For example, recently, nearly 400 global companies, cities, states and regions set 100 percent renewable energy targets and/or zero-emissions targets, including California, the world’s fifth-largest economy, and companies with collective annual revenues of more than $2.75 trillion.

Energy companies and regulators will have to adapt and develop innovative mechanisms to respond to these goals. The shift to electrification of mobility will affect liquid-fuels demand and create new competitors and collaborators. Consider the e-vehicle charging infrastructure initiative in California backed by the state’s three investor-owned utilities. The lines are blurring between utilities, O&G majors and investors as drivers of disruption challenge existing structures.

As with other areas of the energy transition, the pace of electrification is uncertain but can be expected to grow rapidly. Regulations, including pressure to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles, are pushing the switch toward EVs, with predictions of worldwide e-vehicle growth at 11 million in 2025 and with China accounting for almost 50 percent of the global EV market. Countries and companies are battling for competitive positions in the changing mobility sector. The United Kingdom, for example, recently set out a plan to become the world leader in electric and zero-emission vans, trucks and cars.

Looking ahead

Leveraging evolving technology opportunities to simultaneously focus on the three aspects of the energy trilemma — security, equity and environmental sustainability — not only can grow economies, but also can transform societies. Yet the complexity of issues facing the globalized energy industry make them impossible for countries to tackle in isolation.

Navigating through evolving policy and regulatory frameworks across states, along with innovating in the field of power generation, is key to achieving progress and maintaining balance. In this changing context, policymakers at all levels and those in the energy sector, both legacy and new players, must engage to ensure policy and regulatory frameworks enable economies and societies to fully leverage the new opportunities to meet the energy trilemma.","The comparative rankings and profiles of the 125 economies covered in the World Energy Trilemma Index 2018 highlight how the exponential acceleration of interconnected megatrends shaping the global energy sector are rapidly evolving the means to achieve and balance energy trilemma goals.

As a matter of fact, it has a vast number of use cases in various industries. One German startup uses technology in its daily operations as a licensed energy supplier. Founded earlier in 2018, Lition is already available to 41 million households in over 10 major cities across Germany.

A Blockchain Platform for Energy Supply Contracts

Finding affordable energy providers is an issue millions of consumers face across the world. As consumption goes up and traditional fuel sources become depleted, energy prices increase. For private households, living from salary to salary, the growing electricity and heating costs become a burden. However, the process of looking for the best option on the market is not easy, due to the lack of a coherent, centralised platform.

Bring Lition into the energy trading game. Starting as a P2P energy trading dApp, Lition Energy is now an officially licensed energy supplier. The company co-founded by Dr Richard Lohwasser and Dr Kyung-Hun Ha currently uses the Ethereum blockchain to “bring power to the people”.

However, Lition has just recently partnered with SAP, a multinational software corporation, in order to work together on a next-generation blockchain protocol. The Berlin-based company believes there are many limitations which are making the blockchain mainstream adoption slow. Together with SAP, they believe their scalable public-private blockchain solution will solve this problem.

Lition Platform Features

The solution developed by Lition has a range of features and benefits adapted to strict business and regulatory requirements of the energy market. For instance:

The platform stores the customers’ private data on private sidechains;

Private data is stored only as long as it is necessary and is fully deletable;

The platform can execute smart contracts for $0.01 within a 3-second timeframe for confirmation;

The system is infinitely scalable, as every sidechain added to it increases throughput.

“Democratisation of the Energy Sector”

“More than 90% of energy production is based on ‘dirty energy’.”

Lition Energy aims to eliminate third parties and middlemen in the relationship between energy producers and end consumers. This will lower the costs and make the market more transparent.

As the company’s CEO, Dr Richard Lohwasser, explains:

Lition Energy wants to connect producers and customers directly. Directly, through our blockchain-based energy exchange, so that they can trade energy without intervening through the large traditional industry players. The customers can choose themselves which producer they want to take.

He also adds that this is his view of democratisation of the energy sector.

Aside from the costs, what Lition is focusing on is also the importance of sustainable energy. As Dr Kyung-Hun Ha, COO of Lition Energy emphasizes, more than 90% of energy production is based on ‘dirty energy’ .

Use Cases Beyond Energy Trading

As a matter of fact, Lition is not a platform strictly reserved for energy trading. Any industry, that deals with private data, could use it. The company website lists industries such as the automotive, healthcare/ pharmaceuticals, media, and travel among the ones that can benefit from their blockchain platform.

By the end of this year, the company also plans to bring its blockchain-based system to the electric vehicle charging stations.

It is comprised of 148 homes pursuing LEED Platinum certification that empower residents to be pioneers in energy and join a movement creating net-zero energy communities. Each home will be equipped with rooftop solar panels, a new and affordable sonnen energy storage system designed for mass market appeal, a smart thermostat and an EV charger – all controlled by way of sonnen's powerful new energy automation and artificial intelligence (AI) software platform.

Hunter's Point sonnenCommunity represents the first time an energy storage system has worked in concert with Google Home in a master-planned development, capable of maximizing the intelligent use of each household's renewable energy. In initial tests, it was determined that the already-built homes are generating approximately 96% of their own clean power, with the goal of being fully net-zero. In total, the Hunter's Point sonnenCommunity projects represent 9MWh of storage capacity and 7.2MW of power.

Following the installment of the first 148 homes, Pearl Homes will commence a second development comprised of 720 apartments, making additional living options possible for those who don't currently own a home, but wish to make a difference for the environment. It will be the first net-zero rental community of this size, with cost-affordable pricing designed to provide people of varying income levels with the opportunity to live in a greener residence.

""We are thrilled to partner with Pearl Homes, the unparalleled leader in building LEED Platinum homes in the U.S., as we upend the traditional homebuilding vision and replace it with one based on decarbonizing the grid and establishing a complete solution for green living that is affordable for a much broader market,"" said Blake Richetta, Senior Vice President and head of sonnen's U.S. operations. ""Together with our partners at Pearl Homes and Google Home, we are effectively demonstrating the intersection between renewable energy, home automation and homebuilding, establishing a blueprint for the affordable clean energy home of the future.""

The first-of-its-kind community is designed to decongest the wires of the local utility grid, providing load- shaping throughout the day to support intelligent demand management; establish smart configurable backup that provides resiliency and peace of mind for homeowners in the face of storms and other natural disasters; and the ability to live a cleaner lifestyle than any other development in the country.

""For years, energy experts have sought an answer to the solar conundrum: how to generate and store enough solar for our homes,"" said Marshall Gobuty, President of Sarasota, FL-based Pearl Homes. ""sonnen's technology in combination with our LEED Platinum home design has changed the equation for the ability to truly optimize smart homes using solar plus storage to the point where we are capable of building sustainable communities that share solar and decarbonize the region, one Pearl Home at a time.""

The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has recognized Pearl Homes as a visionary leader for the company's focus on building disruptive innovation and creating a future model for LEED-certified, Net-Zero energy homes. With a focus on environmental and sustainable building and a goal to attain climate-positive buildings and homes that reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Pearl Homes President Marshall Gobuty and sonnen Senior Vice President Blake Richetta will speak at the 2018 Greenbuild International Conference and Expo taking place November 14-16.

""'Pearl Homes' vision of increasing access to sustainable homes is directly aligned with USGBC's vision to achieve green buildings for all within a generation,"" said Mahesh Ramanujam, president and CEO, USGBC. ""Pearl Homes uses a streamlined process to achieve the highest levels of sustainability and occupant health. With the addition of sonnen's intelligent clean energy management technology, the development of this community brings the potential for energy-positive living to the mainstream. Pearl Homes and sonnen understand the value of LEED and have exemplified extraordinary leadership in reshaping their sector.

About Pearl Homes

Marshall Gobuty founded Pearl Homes in 2015, when he broke ground on the award-winning Mirabella, a 55+ community of 158 LEED Platinum certified homes in Bradenton, FL. The development was one of the first in the U.S. to achieve LEED certification on a production scale, lowering the cost of Mirabella's single- family homes to within 5 percent of a conventional new home. The breakthrough earned Mirabella the USGBC's 2016 and 2017 Builder of the Year Award.

Mirabella also earned the 2018 55Places.com's Most Innovative Communities Award; the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) award for Best 55+ Active Adult Communities of 2016; the 2017 Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association Parade of Homes Green Award for Eco-Conscious Design; and the 2016 & 2017 Southeast Building Conference (SEBC) Aurora Awards for Energy-Efficient Design, Water-Wise Home, and Green Construction.

It went beyond the requirements of the town of Basalt as an investment in its work force.

RANDY UDALL GRANT RECIPIENTS In addition to the Roaring Fork Club, the recipients of The Randy Udall Energy Pioneer Grants in 2018 were: •City of Aspen, $200,000, for installing smart meters in all residences in the utility service area and upgrading infrastructure in the distribution network. •Farm Collaborative, $25,000, for a carbon sequestration project known as alley cropping at Cozy Point Ranch. •Roaring Fork School District, $63,458, for an electric heating system and a 32-kilowatt photovoltaic system for the Cardiff Mesa employee housing project. •The town of Snowmass Village, $110,000, for an 83-kilowatt solar PV system for its town hall, offsetting 73 percent of electrical usage.

A $110,000 grant to help purchase a solar photovoltaic system was the cherry on the top of the Roaring Fork Club’s construction of a new affordable-housing project.

The private golf and fishing club in Basalt was one of the winners of The Randy Udall Energy Pioneer Grants from the Community Office for Resource Efficiency (CORE). The club will use the grant to install solar panels on the garages where homeowners and guests park their vehicles.

“Give CORE credit for not looking at the club through a different lens,” said Geoffrey Hasley, general manager and chief operating officer for the club.

CORE could have balked at providing a grant for a private club where cabins sell for multi-million dollars, he acknowledged. In reality, the project might not have been pursued if not for the grant sparking incentive, Hasley said.

The club’s board of directors approved covering the remainder of the cost of the project. The total cost is estimated at $320,000, according to Teri Bruna, construction coordinator for the affordable-housing project.

The 160-kilowatt system will generate the equivalent of 63 percent of the affordable-housing complex’s demand, according to estimates from project designers.

The Roaring Fork Club recently finished construction of 41 units of affordable housing. It constructed more than was required by the town of Basalt as part of the approval of an expansion of 13 lots for free-market cabins.

“We built more than what was required. Why? Our staff is extremely important to me,” Hasley said.

Investing in the work force is a clear-cut need, especially in the Roaring Fork Valley where there are more jobs than workers to fill them, he said.

The Roaring Fork Club previously had 19 units of affordable housing. It demolished those units and built 41 one-, two- and three-bedroom rental apartments in seven buildings at a different site at the club. Some of the affordable-housing units have stunning views downvalley, even better than the multimillion-dollar neighboring cabins.

It was a “green” project from the beginning. The club made appliances, cabinets, windows, doors and any other materials that could be salvaged available to the public prior to demolition. People jumped at the opportunity. One owner of rental cabins in Glenwood Springs snared several appliances and cabinets for upgrades in his units, Bruna said.

“We did save quite a bit from going to the landfill,” she said.

A time crunch prevented the club from salving even more of the old building. The old units had to be torn down by March. New modular buildings were hauled to the site in pieces and stitched together. The housing was completed by August.

The club reserves some of the units for rent to employees of the Basalt town government. Another building is available to the Aspen Skiing Co. during the winter months, when Skico is facing a housing shortage and the golf club has less demand for units.

Hasley estimated that the club has 100 full-time equivalent employees during summers and somewhere in the 80s during winters. He tries to keep people employed year-round so they have career opportunities. He also wants employees to put down roots, if they desire. The demand has grown among employees to return to the campus, he said.

Bruna said she hopes the solar PV project is a first step for renewable energy for the club.

The Randy Udall grants are named in memory of CORE’s founder and first executive director. The grants in his name are CORE’s largest and most competitive program. The annual awards provide funding to public agencies, affordable housing, schools, nonprofits and businesses for projects that use energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation to reduce carbon emissions. Grants are offered between $20,000 and $200,000.

More on CORE and its grants for 2018 can be found at http://www.aspen​core.org .

“We’re proud to recognize these innovative projects that are supporting clean air, smart energy and will contribute toward a stable climate,” Mona Newton, executive director of CORE, said in a statement. “By using less energy, we can have the biggest impact on lowering carbon emissions and building a safer, healthier community.”

SVL, the alternative asset management arm of State Bank of India’s subsidiary SBI Capital Markets Ltd, plans to raise ₹ 400 crore for the SME fund and ₹ 350 crore for the affordable housing fund.

“With these two new funds, we are looking forward to strengthening our foothold in the economically and socially relevant sectors,"" said Varsha Purandare, managing director and chief executive at SBI Capital Markets. The two funds will help address the equity gap in the SME sector and improve the availability of affordable housing in India, she added.

The housing fund will initially focus on the country’s top eight cities, which are among India’s most active real estate markets, SVL said in a statement.

“In the housing industry, SBI is already the largest provider of home loans from the banking sector. Further, it has provided significant loan funding for construction of housing projects,"" the statement said.

The SME sector is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, and, as per International Finance Corp., is estimated to account for over 40% of India’s GDP by 2020, the statement added. “Bridging the equity gap in the SME sector is therefore crucial for the overall economic development of the country and hence SVL’s launch of the SME Fund,"" it said.

The two new funds follow SBI’s Neev Fund, launched in 2015 to cater exclusively to small infrastructure projects in low income states, in sectors like water and sanitation, clean energy, and urban infrastructure. The Neev Fund has raised capital commitments from SBI and the Department of International Development of the UK.

The Neev Fund has invested in companies such as Milk Mantra Dairy Pvt. Ltd, an Odisha-based manufacturer and marketer of milk and milk-based products; cold chain logistics solutions provider Crystal Logistic Ltd and wind energy producer United Sustainable Energy India Pvt. Ltd.

Apart from the funds being managed by SBICAP Ventures, the lender has co-sponsored another private equity fund—Oman India Joint Investment Fund Management Co Ltd (OIJIF), a mid-market private equity firm — with the State General Reserve Fund of Oman. The fund announced a $220 million first close of its second PE fund earlier this year.

OIJIF, set up in 2010, invested around $100 million from its first fund.

Organized by the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board (CNY RPDB), Alliance for a Green Economy (AGREE), with support from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and a team of volunteers, this two-year community-based campaign for Cayuga, Cortland, Madison, Onondaga, and Oswego counties aims to help home and building owners install ground source (“geothermal”) and air source heat pumps designed for cold climates, as well as heat pump water heaters. Central New York was also awarded an additional $350,000 in funding for related workforce development and low-to-moderate income household projects.

The City of Syracuse publicly announced its support for HeatSmart CNY today, after the

Common Council unanimously passed a memorializing resolution on Wednesday, November 7th. “The city of Syracuse is excited that NYSERDA chose Central New York as the pilot for this $500,000 campaign, which will make efficient heat pumps accessible to low and moderate income households and promote jobs in this growing industry,” said Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh. “This will help residents more efficiently warm their homes and add to the growing list of efficient geothermal buildings in Syracuse, like the Hotel Skyler, Jefferson Clinton Commons, and the Pike Block.”

HeatSmart CNY builds on local Solarize campaigns and the HeatSmart Tompkins strategy to make the process of switching heat sources relatively easy. The campaign will offer free public workshops and open house visits to help people understand the technologies available, the importance of air sealing and insulation, and the rebates and incentives currently available from New York State, the Federal government, and utility companies.

Three installer teams –Halco, Snug Planet, and Geotherm / ACES-Energy—were selected by the HeatSmart CNY Steering Committee after a careful evaluation process. They collectively bring over 35 years of heat pump installation experience to the program. Participants will be able to receive free site assessments from multiple companies and compare quotes. HeatSmart CNY is partnering with experts John Manning and Dick Kornbluth to provide a hotline for home and building owners to help answer any questions.

“Many people don’t realize that even in Upstate New York, we have plenty of heat in the ground and in the air to make cold-climate heat pumps an efficient and economical energy choice,” said Yusuf Abdul-Qadir, a Syracuse resident who is installing ground source heat pump and air source heat pump systems in his home and rental property. “And in the summer months, heat pumps run in reverse to cool and dehumidify our buildings. Heat pumps make our homes more comfortable and safer for our families.”

Efficient electric heat pumps also have the added benefit of being good for the environment. Over 1/3 of New York’s energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions come from heating and cooling buildings, mostly with fossil fuels. Many homeowners across Upstate New York have made their homes effectively “net zero” energy by installing combinations of heat pumps and solar panels. Even when powered by the grid, 49 percent of the electricity produced in Upstate New York came from renewables in 2017 (Source: NYISO 2018 Power Trends Report). “With the HeatSmart CNY program, the region can make a decisive move toward a sustainable future,” said Lindsay Speer, HeatSmart CNY Program Manager. “If you’ve ever wanted to stop burning fossil fuels as your heat source, this is the opportunity to do it!”

Typical homes using expensive oil or propane heat save $1500-1800/year in fuel costs when they switch to heat pumps. Homes using inefficient baseboard electric and those still using coal are also excellent candidates for switching. Interested property owners can attend any of the free community workshops to enroll in the program or can enroll on-line at HeatSmartCNY.org.

Attending a workshop is not a requirement for participation in HeatSmart CNY, but is strongly encouraged. The kickoff workshop will be held at the South Side Innovation Center located at 2610 South Salina Street, Syracuse on Thursday, November 15 from 6:00 – 7:30pm. The first Open House will be held from 2 – 4:30 PM on Nov. 18 at William Sunderlin’s geothermally heated home at 305 East Genesee Street in Fayetteville (please park on nearby streets). Other workshops and open houses will be held in venues in various neighborhoods and towns within the geographic boundaries of the program and announced in the future.

Individuals and organizations volunteering their time to guide the campaign include Brendon Fox of Home HeadQuarters; Hanna Ring of Citizens Campaign for the Environment; Pompey resident John Shaheen; Marian Brown, Director of the Center for Sustainability and the Environment at Wells College; Sarah Krisch, Senior Planner for Madison County; Sha’Sha Wheat of Hope 4 Us Housing; Sally Ward of P.E.A.C.E. Inc., geothermal homeowner William Sunderlin; and Syracuse resident and sustainability strategist Yusuf Abdul-Qadir, who is currently installing a geothermal system in his home.

If so, you probably toyed with the idea for a minutes before you came back to reality. Then, a litany of reasons crushed your dream — too expensive, too hard to maintain, too much bureaucracy, not enough of space, and the list goes on and on. For many a vacation home is a just a faraway dream but Monocabin, a minimalistic Mediterranean pre-fab home design may make your fantasy into a reality. Starting at just below 50,000 Euros these 26 meter homes can be placed on any plot of land you desire with the convenience of being plug-and-play complete with fixtures, furniture, and appliances. Mandalaki, a Milanese design studio came up with the innovative, eco-friendly concept and are working with US-based company BoutiqueHomes to bring these architectural gems stateside. I spoke to both companies to get the low-down on Monocabin — suddenly a house in the countryside doesn’t seem so out of reach anymore.

Veronique Lievre, Co-Founder of BoutiqueHomes

How did your partnership with Mandalaki come about?

We initially partnered with Mandalaki by featuring their very first prototype of the Monocabin as a vacation rental on BoutiqueHomes. When we heard that a big part of their strategy was to begin selling the homes, it was a normal next step and evolution in our partnership. We've recently launched our online marketplace and store which sells and highlights the work of our community members and were delighted to become their exclusive partner in the US.

What's your criteria for partnership with design studios?

We look for a common sensibility and philosophy in design, creativity and imagination that celebrates talent and innovation in our approach to travel and hospitality.

What do you think is the unique selling point of Monocabin?

Prefab is becoming a key trend in housing and Mandalaki's innovative and eco-friendly approach also doubles as a ""livable design object"" that goes beyond componentry to become art. The high-quality materials have been thoughtfully designed with a long life cycle, and can last up to 100 years. It’s also adaptable to all types of terrain. A major plus is that buyers can experience it first hand by staying in the prototype in Rhodes in a gorgeous setting.

In what ways does Monocabin symbolize the future of home design?

Monocabins symbolize the future of home design solutions that are affordable and accessible, with high-tech, ""smart"" technology and functionality along with an environmentally responsible footprint. That's also stylish!

When will Monocabin be available in the US?

Monocabins are ready to ship in the US and Europe as of three weeks ago.

George Kolliopoulos, Founder/Co-Designer of Monocabin

What were the most important design elements you wanted to accomplish in creating Monocabin?

Monocabin was conceived as a livable design object exploring the intimate space of the individual. The architecture was thought of as not only an industrial design element but also a way to promote democratic architecture. It is a symbolic representation of the collective imagination of our design studio, Mandalaki, incentivized by a single goal: a return to oneself. This concept is shown in the modularity elements inside the house, which are customizable to any desire, all while starting from the basic model of Monocabin.

One of the most exciting aspects of Monocabin is the price, how is it possible to create a home for just 50,000 Euros?

I will use my daily life quote “Less is More”. It starts with choosing a smaller home which considerably reduces the price. Then, adding the design philosophy to the architecture while combining it with the highest quality and latest technology of prefabricated homes, it makes the price very exciting.

How can a buyer further customize their home (pool, outdoor space, etc.)?

As the house has been designed to be customizable, it is very easy to add any personalized features to it. Moreover, when ordering a Monocabin, you have a real dedicated design team from our studio Mandalaki and great partners to support each request for a seamless customer experience.

How are you able to ship to remote locations?

Monocabin prefab enters all in one single container. It makes the shipping easier and less expensive while making it possible to use all kinds of modes of transportation such as boat, truck or even by helicopter if needed. As the installation of Monocabin prefab is only done in seven days, adding the delivery time doesn’t make a big difference our customers in remote locations.

Your homes are made to last — what exactly does that mean?

Every component from the screw to the finishing of the walls is chosen very carefully to create a long-lasting design solution. It is also a smartly-designed house and made in Italy with passion. The combination of knowledge from our team and partners using high-quality materials makes Monocabin a house that stands the test of time.

Are Monocabins environmentally friendly?

Being environmentally friendly was the essence of what brought us to the concept of Monocabin prefab. It's a much more sustainable and profitable solution. The building industry digs into the ground and changes the layer of the planet making them one of the biggest pollutants and energy consumers in their process. Using prefabricated homes, you don’t need any foundations, for example. It allows hyper-efficient production with zero waste. Monocabin is made with sustainable materials, LED lighting and even installs solar panels to ensure use of clean energy. It ends up being a more sustainable way of living. We also use the surrounding nature as an asset to the ecosystem of the house. Our goal is to leave the planet better than we found it using the power of design.

Plan for former brownfields site wins CDFA, NHHFA funding

Plans to build a 54-unit affordable housing complex at the site of the former Allied Leather Tannery property in Penacook have taken a big step forward following decisions by the NH Housing Finance Authority and NH Community Development Finance Authority.

The Caleb Group, a nonprofit affordable housing developer based in Swampscott, Mass., is proposing the project, known as Penacook Landing.

The project is to be developed in two phases. Phase I is made up of 34 housing units; of which 31 will be affordable for households meeting U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development income criteria.

On Oct. 25, the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority awarded the Caleb Development Corporation an allocation of $714,000 in Low Income Housing Tax Credits for the project, which will generate approximately $5.95 million in funding for the project.

On Nov. 1, the CDFA awarded the city $500,000 in Community Development Block Grants for demolition and other site work activities for the project. That followed the Oct. 25 decision by the NHHFA to allocate $714,000 in Low Income Housing Tax Credits to The Caleb Group for the project, essentially generating some $5.95 million in funding.

In May 2017, the Concord City Council agreed to sell 2.5 acres of the four-ace brownfield site to The Caleb Group for $540,000. The city is retain ownership of the remaining acreage along the Contoocook River for a riverfront park.

Total development budget for Phase I is approximately $7.6 million.

The Caleb Group has secured development permits and approvals for the project from Concord’s Zoning Board of Adjustment and Planning Board.

Demolition and site work activities by the city are expected to be completed using CDBG funds by spring 2019. After that, the property will be conveyed to The Caleb Group to begin construction of their affordable housing development. It is anticipated that the first phase will be completed in early summer 2020. Caleb plans to develop the second and final phase of the project with 20 additional units of housing in 2021, depending on funding, officials said.","Penacook affordable housing project gets big boostsPlan for former brownfields site wins CDFA, NHHFA fundingPlans to build a 54-unit affordable housing complex at the site of the former Allied Leather Tannery property in Penacook have taken a big step forward following decisions by the NH Housing Finance Authority and NH Community Development Finance Authority.

167,https://www.brownstoner.com/real-estate-market/affordable-housing-boom-unaffordable-de-blasio-421a-housing-crisis-homeless/,"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Brownstoner,Affordable Housing Boom Not Making New York City More Affordable,"In October 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his reformed affordable housing strategy. Titled “Housing New York 2.0” (a sequel to the original “Housing New York”), it was meant to be a cause for celebration. His stated plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in 2014 would be achieved by 2022, the city said. So they were expanding on their initial goal, making a commitment to build or preserve 300,000 units by 2026.

This sounds like a success story. The mayor is close to reaching his stated goal, which, in many ways, is a remarkable feat. But in reality, only a small number of those units will help make the city more affordable. In Brooklyn, a quick look at the affordable housing options show that a startling number have monthly rents that are close to the current rents of market-rate units, and often in the same building.

“When the ads [for affordable housing] come out, there is no way for anybody in our neighborhoods to get one of those apartments,” said Jean Folkes, a resident of Flatbush and member of the Flatbush Tenant Coalition. “We don’t see any real affordable housing happening anywhere in Brooklyn.”

Affordability is an urgent issue. According to a report by New York University’s Furman Center published in 2017, the median monthly rents in New York have risen by about $300 since 2000, at the same time that the median income of a household has increased only by $145 per month. More recently, a report in the New York Times found that one out of every 10 children in New York City schools lived in “temporary” housing in the last year.

In other words, the need for affordable housing is real. Some claim it is being addressed: A building boom is reshaping Brooklyn and all of New York City, justified largely, in Brooklyn, by the much-needed affordable housing it will bring. But who benefits?

“This is ridiculous,” wrote one Brownstoner commenter on a recent story about an affordable housing lottery in Bushwick. “These rents are not ‘affordable,’ and if you make enough to qualify, you can afford a market-rate apartment in Bushwick/Ridgewood.”

There are many ways to build affordable housing in New York City. For example, the affordable housing created on city land by agencies and other nonprofits is often 100 percent and aimed at low-income populations; the same with affordable housing built under the Extremely Low & Low-Income Affordability (ELLA) program, which requires that 10 percent of the apartments in a project are set aside for formerly homeless households and an additional 30 percent of the apartments are affordable to what HPD defines as households with “extremely low and very low-incomes.”

But there are other ways as well. Some of the most egregious examples of units that stretch the definition of affordability occur in privately developed buildings that receive or are set to receive the 421a tax exemption. A tax incentive program that was created in 1971 to help promote new development during a housing crisis, 421a has gone through many iterations. The latest, passed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2017 — it has now been renamed Affordable New York — allows a percentage of the required affordable units to rent at 130 percent of the area median income.

Calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the area median income for the New York City region is currently $93,900 for a three-person family. Which means that at 130 percent of the area median income, a family of three — two parents and a child, for example — must bring in $122,070 a year to qualify for a two-bedroom apartment.

In many communities, this is not feasible. Jose Lopez, Organizing Director for Make The Road, says that membership of the Bushwick-based community organization makes between $18,000 and $35,000 annually. “These are families with the biggest need and they are vastly ignored by new construction projects,” he said. “As a result, more and more of our members are fleeing the city altogether.”

This is not surprising. An affordable studio in the block-long development at 616-626 Bushwick Avenue called The Saint Marks rents for $2,013 a month, according to a lottery listing in July. A market-rate studio in the same complex rents for $2,150, a difference of $137.

Back in April, a lottery launched for 11 affordable units at 867 Dekalb Avenue in Bed Stuy, a few blocks from the busy Myrtle-Broadway intersection. Two of the units were set at 115 percent, five at 125 percent and the final four at 130 percent of the area median income, with rents starting at $2,163 and topping out at $2,716 per month. Market-rate rentals in the same building, which launched the prior month, were often cheaper than their affordable counterparts: one-bedrooms ranged from $2,100 to $2,500, two-bedrooms ranged from $2,290 to $2,865 and three-bedroom units from $2,740 to $3,300.

As of this writing, there are 709 affordable units available in Brooklyn through the lottery system. Of those units, 280 of them are set at an area median income of 130 percent, and 50, all located at the smaller tower that’s part of the controversial Pier 6 development, at 15 Bridge Park Drive in Brooklyn Bridge Park, are set at an area median income of 165 percent (the development is not part of any affordability program).

The mayor’s request for affordable housing on Pier 6 sparked a series of lawsuits from local residents over the nature and need for more housing in the park. The mayor’s vision ultimately prevailed, resulting in the building of an additional and affordable tower that does not contribute to the income of the park and is reserved for individuals and families earning between $100,000 and $200,000 a year.

Of the 100 units of affordable housing now available at Pier 6, only 25 are set at an area median income of 80 percent, with rents ranging from $1,394 to $2,075 a month. The highest affordable rents are set at 165 percent of the area median income, with a studio going for $2,947 a month, a one-bedroom for $3,147 and a three-bedroom apartment going for $4,380 a month.

“The way it’s played out hasn’t been positive,” said Councilmember Antonio Reynoso of 421a’s implementation in gentrifying communities. He added that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, a program initiated by de Blasio in 2016 that requires developers who benefit from an upzoning to set aside a percentage of affordable units, with requirements that in its different options are all lower than 130 percent of the area median income, has been more beneficial than 421a.

Although, even here there are still problems: Because the affordability options under 421a almost match some of the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing options, developers can “double-dip,” meaning they get the benefit of a 35-year tax abatement — an extension of the previous 25 years required by 421a prior to 2017 — without having to change much from what they are already required to set aside via Mandatory Inclusionary Housing.

“It is quite absurd,” Lopez said.

Apartments built under the 421a program have benefits, such as their mandate to abide by the rent stabilization laws during the period. But in recent conversations with residents, local activists and city politicians, many said they feel the program needs to be drastically revised, and new and better ways to build affordable housing need to be developed.

“Our affordable housing crisis hits hard at every income level, from those facing extreme poverty to middle-class families made up of hard-working civil servants like teachers and firefighters,” said Borough President Eric Adams in a statement provided to Brownstoner. “The existing tax incentive programs are simply not enough to deal with the depth and breadth of this crisis.

“We need to be creating more affordable housing, at every income band, and we need to be doing it faster. We need to invest time and energy in establishing new initiatives that protect our existing affordable housing stock, including through technological advances that help hold bad-acting landlords accountable for destabilizing families and raising rents, and we need to explore how we can reinvigorate existing programs like Mitchell-Lama that have been so impactful for so many families.”

Reynoso thinks there is a brighter future. “When 421a gets renegotiated, we’re going to be in a different time in New York,” he says. “It’s going to be a more progressive city, and I can see it getting a lot more aggressive, a lot more beneficial to the communities that are being affected.”

But for those who most need affordable housing now, the options are grim. “It’s not really for us,” Folkes says about the bulk of affordable housing. “People who are working at McDonald’s, people working at Macy’s, they don’t make that kind of money. People who clean people’s homes, they need somewhere to live too.”

Last time, we talked about some of the macroeconomic issues contributing to the historically severe housing crisis we are experiencing worldwide. We touched briefly on the origins of factory-built housing, from the early, diversified Sears kit homes to the unvarying trailer homes that have come to symbolize an economically disenfranchised segment of society. Here we’ll bring our view across oceans and look at the reality—and promise—of modern, precision-built modular housing as it exists today.

In the U.K., the term ‘prefab’ has negative connotations of poor quality that serve as a reminder of some leaky, hurried postwar replacements for houses bombed during the Blitz. But we’re seeing signs that prefab has grown up, from the highly desirable, glass-gabled modular homes being produced by Huf Haus in Germany to the 2 million units of quality housing manufactured by Japan’s R&D-intensive Sekisui House. Take a look—these factory-built dwellings go far beyond a modern replacement for trailers, or social housing. They’re actually something you’d want to live in.

Just as advanced technology is evolving ugly and relatively inefficient solar panels into alternative energy sources that are clean, green and cheap, so the strides in precision manufacturing are also enabling better quality, better value, cleaner, greener and cheaper housing to be built on a production line.

In quality as well as design, modular housing is galloping ahead. There’s a huge difference in precision between a timber frame building being erected on-site and modules of a building assembled on a moving production line in a purpose-built factory. Specifications of the latter are accurate to within a fraction of a millimeter—something that’s made possible by digital technology. Along with carbon neutral and super energy efficient construction methods, these new, highly efficient ‘prefabs’ can be finished down to the level of tile, carpeting, even decor before they leave the factory.

This is all well and good in Europe, Asia and the U.K., but what about America? Well, there’s always Amazon. As if on cue, the disruptor of all disruptors is getting in on the modular housing game. When this company sees a void in the market, whether in healthcare or logistics or retail, they step right in and do something radical. A quick search for ‘modular homes’ on Amazon yields, among many books on the subject, a prefabricated 292 square foot “getaway cabin”—with no plumbing or electrical—for $18,800. And a 1,336-square-foot “proper home” with 2 floors and an insulated roof for $64,650. Plus free shipping.

Taking things another disruptive step further, Amazon recently invested in Plant Prefab, a California-based startup, shortly after partnering with Lennar, the largest home builder in the U.S., to hard-wire Alexa into every new home the company builds.

Alternatively, the DeLuxe-Built modular housing factory in Pennsylvania features a quarter-mile assembly line originally set up to build Stuart Tanks for World War II. Taking its cues from recent European and Asian models, Deluxe-Built no longer produces only wood frame, box construction, but has moved on to steel frame, multistory buildings as well. They employ a staff of architects and engineers who hail from some of the most famous design shops in the world. They too can deliver turnkey, ready-to-move-in buildings— which, in the case of their hotels, means there are sheets on the beds and towels on the racks at delivery.

A less-discussed aspect of the housing crisis is that people are now buying houses with the expectation of staying in them, and using them for every conceivable purpose: home, work, Airbnb, in-law housing, adult child housing, and so on. Wouldn’t they rather have a well built, affordable, sustainable house that they won't need to fix or straighten? And when you consider this in context of the expected lifespan of the end product, because of the efficiency and precision of construction, we’re now actually looking at prefab or modular housing lasting longer than new on-site construction. The hangover perception of postwar prefab housing in the U.K., or trailers in the U.S., is being turned on its head.

Clearly, modular building or prefab methods can address the shortage of affordable housing in a revolutionary way. They offer the opportunity to produce quickly and at scale. The need for more housing is not simply about increasing the amount of housing stock, but increasing the speed at which new homes are completed, without compromising their quality. Modular manufacturing thus represents a great hope for innovation across the new housing sector.

Right now, about 3 percent of construction in America is modular and factory built; this number is projected to reach 10 percent over the next five years. In the U.K., recognizing that affordable housing receives minimal equity or new investment from the private sector, we have pledged to build 3,000 affordable, energy efficient homes each year for the next four years. We’ve invested in a plant where we can prefabricate them to spec, and make use of resources from new technologies to engineers and designers from Rolls Royce and Formula One.

Is there any reason we, or other companies, shouldn’t do the same in the U.S., where the crisis is even harsher, the numbers steeper—and the potential return on capital invested much greater? I can’t think of one.","This second article on affordable housing looks at how prefabricated housing has evolved, once again appealing to many tastes and economic levels.

Broad policy reforms are needed to properly address Queensland’s ongoing housing crisis and help those most in need, a government expert has told a Griffith University symposium.

Speaking at the 2018 Affordable Housing Symposium in Brisbane, Ms Trish Woolley, the Deputy Director-General of Housing, Homelessness and Sport in the Department of Housing and Public Works, said community consultation will be a key step in ascertaining legislative areas in need of the most pressing attention.

The consultation period, which started in October, runs through to the end of November, and “will likely end up telling us a lot about what needs reforming in the residential tenancy laws,” Ms Woolley said.

“That’s its public point and purpose, but it’s actually going to tell us a lot about the housing needs and aspirations of Queenslanders, which is something that we’re quite excited about.”

Queensland’s housing situation has seen an increase in the number of renters over the past several years, and it now possesses the highest proportion of renters of any Australian state.

According to Ms Woolley, more than a third (34 per cent) of Queenslanders are living in rental homes in both private and social housing.

Of those, 42 per cent are families, and 43 per cent have been renting for more than a decade. People over 55 make up the fastest-growing age group of tenants, while renters are also contending with a lack of security and tenure; the average tenancy is about 16 months, with half of current tenants living under a 12-month lease.

“In terms of housing affordability, we know that people on moderate incomes, including key workers, are finding it harder to find affordable accommodation close to where they work,” Ms Woolley added.

“We know that across the state this situation looks different, impacted by local economies and differences within the housing market, and there’s some work the Department’s doing at the moment to better understand that picture in a Queensland context.”

As part of that work, in June last year, the Queensland government released the Queensland Housing Strategy, a 10-year strategic plan for the provision of housing services in the state.

“That strategy has a very pragmatic objective: that every Queenslander has access to a safe, secure and affordable home that meets their needs and enables participation in the social and economic life of our prosperous state,” Ms Woolley said.

Built around four pillars – growth, prosperity, connections and confidence, the QHS “seeks to actively work across all parts of the housing system”, she said, and place the focus back on the human element at the core of the issue.

“It’s about people, it’s about Queenslanders and it’s about ensuring that they have a housing outcome which enables their participation in social and economic life,” Ms Woolley said of the strategy.

“We think that having a better understanding of the people we house, the people we support, and their aspirations, that that will have a key role in delivering better housing outcomes right across the continuum.

“It sounds simple and intuitive, but for a housing authority, for a big government agency that manages over 53,000 properties across a diverse state, it can be easy to become really transactional and rules-bound.”

“People are at the centre of our work; understanding who it is that we need to support right across the continuum, their circumstances, and getting better information to match their housing products and services to meet their needs is really critical to our work,” she continued.

“One thing I think we all know is that we need to do something different; and if we’re going to be responsive and person-centred, we need to change the way we do things.”

Issues for the industry, owners and tenants – including security, tenure, privacy, rent increases and pet allowances – featured highly on the symposium’s agenda, which also saw presentations from academics and stakeholders vested in the prosperity and equitability of the state’s housing market.

Symposium convenors Professor Eduardo Roca, Associate Professor Richard Chung and Dr Benjamin Liu said the event had been a great success, with keen insight into, and exploration of, one of the country’s most urgent social issues.

“Today’s discussions explored issues such as sustainability, policy strategies for government and industry, and other economic and social dimensions of this complex, evolving problem,” Professors Roca and Chung said.

“On behalf of the symposium’s organising committee, we would like to extend our sincerest thanks to our excellent speakers and high-quality attendees for their contributions to our lively discussions.”

Alongside Ms Woolley, the symposium – which was held at the Mercure Pullman King George Square earlier this month – heard from the likes of Professor George Earl, Griffith Business School Dean (Academic) Professor Fabrizio Carmignani, and National Affordable Housing Consortium CEO Mike Myers.

They were joined by Michael Zorbas of the Property Council of Australia, JLL’s Mr David Rees, Griffith academics Professor Mark Brimble and Associate Professor Leigh Shutter, UNSW Professor Hal Pawson, Port Phillip Council member Gary Spivak, and industry representatives Nils Miller (Investec), Ryan Rathborne (Clean Energy Finance Corp) and Chris Menz (Commercial & General).","PublishedBroad policy reforms are needed to properly address Queensland’s ongoing housing crisis and help those most in need, a government expert has told a Griffith University symposium.

The winner will receive 25.000 euro prize money. This year all three finalists of the competition come from the Eindhoven University of Technology. The start-ups that have been selected to pitch their plans in front of the Gouden KIEM jury are Sponsh, Vertoro and Lusoco.

Lourens Boot wants to give people all over the world access to water. He wants to do this in an affordable and energy efficient way and he also wants to help prevent deforestation. “Using technology to lend a hand to nature”, he says from Lisbon, IO called him. Boot tells about how he, together with TU/e researcher Dr Catarina Esteves, started Sponsh over a year ago and which mission he has.

Via Google, looking for ways to get water out of the air, he came across Esteves’ name. That was last summer. Together with his girlfriend and their, at that time one-year-old, son, he spent several months with a camper in Spain and Portugal. “It was very dry that summer. The reservoirs were empty, and trucks drove from north to south to bring water. Yet every morning the stuff we had left outside, was soaking wet from the dew.” He remembered a story about the Namibian desert beetle, from the book by Gunter Pauli, The Blue Economy, and thought: it would be nice to do something with that. The book describes innovations based on nature. “There is so much water in the air, twelve times as much as all the rivers put together. It is an inexhaustible source of water because it fills up again and again.”

There was not much to be found on the internet except for the research of Catarina Esteves. For eight years now she has been working on the material that absorbs moisture at night and releases it during the day at a certain temperature.

Read more about the technical side of the material here.

Esteves wrote several papers and received a lot of media attention for them, Boot explains. “She was proud of this invention and was often asked whether the material was already available. She wanted to scale up. But she also loves her research work very much.” Boot suggested to do it together. She has the role of scientific advisor, Boot the business side. This was the birth of the start-up Sponsh. Now they are over a year further, Esteves works half a day to a day a week for Sponsh, via the TU/e, Boot fulltime. Together they wrote to funds and a collaboration has been set up with the German DITF.de, comparable to the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research, TNO. Together with this research centre, Esteves and Boot scale up the material. That material is almost ready to be tested with customers, Boot says. “According to the Lean start-up method, we make a minimum workable product as quickly as possible, so we can immediately find out what our customers think of it.” Boot will leave for South Africa in January for these tests. It is winter in Portugal, then.

“It’s funny, Catarina is Portuguese and lives in Eindhoven and I’m Dutch and I’m often in Portugal. Close to the customers to get their input and to test the material. We have enough water in the Netherlands”. In the Netherlands, Boot is part of the StartLife incubation program of Wageningen University. They also go to DITF in Denkendorf for consultation. “Catarina is truly a world leader in the field of temperature-sensitive materials. She manages DITF very actively, without her input it would be very difficult for them. While DITF is one of the best research institutes for technical textiles, that is very special to see.”

His love for technology has been there from an early age, “I was always doing crafts, was a fan of MacGyver and went to study at the Delft University of Technology”. The love for Clean Tech came gradually. Boot had a job at Shell until 2014, working with oil and gas. “I wanted to go the sustainable route for some time, and I was almost there. Shell has built the first wind farm in the Netherlands, near IJmuiden together with Nuon. “I almost got to work there, but then the company stopped with the sustainable business branch.” Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth, gave Boot the last push: “I thought what am I doing? At the time, we were drilling shale gas wells in China.” He quit his comfortable job at Shell and took a sabbatical. “Many people thought I was crazy. Oil and gas were still booming, and the price of oil was high.”

During his sabbatical, he met Boyan Slat of The Ocean Cleanup, at a conference. The Ocean Cleanup wants to rid the oceans of plastic. “I had already seen Boyan’s project once during a TED talk. I liked it very much.” Boot was asked to join. “At that time we were at TU Delft, in a room with a large table. Everything was still at the very beginning.” Boot became head of technology, and with his knowledge as an offshore engineer, he adapted the concept to a mobile system. “I did that for two years. When that was ready to go, it was time for me to look further.” For a few months, he worked as CEO for Seabin Project, an early stage start-up to extract plastic from the water. And then went on to travel with his family in a camper.

“Technology has brought us a lot. If you turned forty-two, a hundred years ago, you were an exception. Medicines came in, life became healthier, there was more food, and there were fewer wars. Largely thanks to technology and clever things people came up with. But nature has become the big loser, with pollution, exhaustion of the earth and extinct animals. The balance is gone. I would like to use technology to help nature. My dream is to use this company to guarantee affordable water for everyone and to make dry areas green.”

The start-up is growing. In Portugal, three interns are working on research into the water market and interviews with customers. “Just now one co-founder joined us. He is also working full-time on this. An experienced entrepreneur who is good on the business side, I will focus on the product part and the people and Catarina does science.”

That Sponsh is nominated for the Golden KIEM Award “is just fantastic”, Boot says. “It shows that it is ‘high-end chemistry’. If we win, we can use that money to continue the research.” Until now, Boot financed Sponsh with its own money, subsidies, grants, and prizes. “Financially it is not interesting yet. But with Catarina’s invention, we can make sure that people in dry areas have access to water and the earth will slowly become greener again. I want to wake up for that every morning and put my savings in it.”

171,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boulder-can-teach-nation-housing-crunch-180135043.html,"Wed, 07 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Yahoo Finance,Getting priced out: the housing affordability crisis,"Home prices are ballooning in Boulder, Colo., and the issues facing the idyllic city at the foot of the Rockies could serve as a warning to the rest of the country.

“We are in the middle of a full-fledged housing crisis,” Boulder City Councilwoman Jill Adler Grano tells Yahoo Finance. “The average single-family home price in our community just tipped over $1 million. It’s almost impossible to find anything attached or detached for under $600,000 now. About 52% of our community rents, and of our renter population a majority of them are paying more than 50% of their income on housing.”

Boulder’s home prices are staggering compared to the national average — $377,200 as of September, according to the Census — but the affordability issue at the core of the city’s housing crisis is taking root across the country as well. “It’s not just a Boulder problem,” says Adam Swetlik, a member of the Boulder Housing Advisory Board and part of PLAN Boulder, a citizen advocacy group. “People just get pushed out the more inequality grows.”

For Google employee Meredith Williams, who moved with her family to Boulder last year after living in Boston and the Bay Area, the escalations in the local market are cause for concern.

“Coming from the East Coast and coming from the Bay Area, the living is easy,” Williams says. “I left the Bay Area and I left Palo Alto and I left all of that because it was expensive, because it was difficult, because people weren’t engaged. So I want to make sure that Boulder doesn’t become Bay Area East.”

Williams’ move to join her company’s local office was part of a larger wave that the city has been encouraging. “Boulder is sort of a tech hub, definitely not as big a Silicon Valley but very big for startups, very big for companies that want to provide an awesome, awesome environment for their employees to live and work,” Swetlik says. “When you have all this demand and you can’t really build supply very quickly because of the regulations, the prices just increase and increase and increase.”

Story continues

Those regulations include Boulder’s aggressive zoning rules, which limit the number of units on a property and the number of unrelated people that can live together, among other things – which means there’s less real estate available for young single professionals to double or triple up with roommates to save money on housing. “Eighty-three percent of our residentially zoned land in Boulder is zoned low-density, and within our low-density zones we have some of the strictest rules in the entire country,” Grano says.

Williams is especially cognizant of what she and her fellow tech company workers represent — and how their presence may be contributing to the current crisis.

“Bottom line for us, the housing market going up is an advantage, but that’s also somewhat conflicting because that’s a signifier of it becoming less and less affordable for other people, and that’s not actually what we want and how we want to live in this community,” she says. “How do I mitigate the fact that me and my compatriots are contributing to this housing boom that is pushing out a lot of the original people that made the town so great?”

She isn’t the only one concerned about addressing the rising affordability crisis. “This is going to get worse before it gets better, and it’s going to take compromise and everyone giving a little bit to come up with a solution that we need to address it,” Grano says. “If we can start to address this on the national level, I think we can have more solutions, more funding and greater national awareness of this issue and it can stop being such an isolated city-by-city issue.”

Yahoo Finance visited Boulder for HuffPost’s Listen to America town hall series installment on housing affordability and to talk to residents and local officials about the issues posed by a market that serves as a snapshot of what’s happening across the country.

Watch the full HuffPost Listen to America town hall for To Develop Or Preserve: A Conversation About Affordable Housing In Boulder, CO.

Grano is optimistic about that national conversation moving forward, given recent developments beyond the Boulder County borders.

“One of the things that I’m excited about right now is that the Democratic Party is starting to pick up on the housing crisis as a platform, and I see that in California,” Grano says. “And also Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently introduced a bill to help encourage new housing and also to reduce rents, but what’s happened so far is it’s really been a city-by-city problem.”

SVL, which is an alternative asset manager and a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Capital Markets Ltd, is seeking to raise a corpus of ₹400 crore for SME Fund and ₹350 crore for Affordable Housing Fund.

While the gap in debt funding to SMEs (small and medium enterprises) is increasingly being bridged by NBFCs, there continues to be a significant gap in the equity funding for the sector despite the steep growth rate, State Bank of India’s step-down subsidiary said in a statement.

“The SME landscape is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years and as per IFC, it is estimated to account for over 40 per cent of the GDP by 2020. Bridging the equity gap in the SME sector is, therefore, crucial for the overall economic development of the country and hence SVL’s launch of the SME Fund,” the statement said.

SBI’s step-down subsidiary SVL is launching a private equity fund for providing a stimulus to improving the availability of affordable housing in India. In the initial phase, the focus of the fund will be in eight cities of the country which are amongst the most active real estate markets in India.

The Fund will complement SBI’s role as the largest provider of home loans from the banking sector and also provider of significant loan funding for construction of housing projects.

Varsha Purandare, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, SBI Capital Markets Ltd, said,“With these two new funds, we are looking forward to strengthening our foothold in the economically and socially relevant sectors.

With harsh climates, lack of public transportation and dwindling tobacco farming, coal mining and manufacturing jobs, it can be a struggle to pay the bills and keep up homes. Residents of the region—which stretches from Ohio to North Carolina—need a certain amount of “resilience and determination” to survive, said Stephanie McCullough, who works for the nonprofit Community Housing Coalition in Marshall, N.C.

“Appalachia is just different. It’s a different feel,” said McCullough. “We got a much larger rural desire.”

What that means for multifamily housing is likewise different than the rest of the country.

The region—which has incomes 40 percent lower than the national average—has crumbling homes in needs of repair, few rental properties and a huge need for more affordable housing. Many apartments in Marshall are kept vacant for Airbnb rentals, which drove rents up from about $500 to $900 a month, and the costs of lands and homes are also rising as residents of nearby Asheville, N.C., move in, according to McCullough.

“We’re just seeing people spreading up that have deeper pockets,” she said. “Us little folks who live and work in Madison County, we don’t have the wages.”

Middle Appalachia’s need for affordable housing led Freddie Mac to focus on the region as one of the first markets in a new program aimed to spur investment activity in underserved places around the country, dubbed Duty to Serve. The program—which Fannie Mae is also involved with—sets a three-year framework to build more affordable housing, preserve current ones and increase tax debt equity investment.

“We have activities in all those categories across all those markets,” said Corey Aber, the director of Freddie Mac’s community mission and impact finance team. “We do have a pretty ambitious agenda to better understand the markets.”

A spokesman for Fannie Mae did not respond to a request for comment.

As part of the program, Freddie Mac plans to release a series of white papers on the overall housing market in these regions and several other topics to increase investors’ knowledge about the areas. It published its first two last month focusing on multifamily housing markets in Appalachia and tribal lands across the country.

“These are truly underserved areas and we wanted to make it clear what the housing market looks like,” said Steve Guggenmos, the vice president of multifamily research and modeling at Freddie Mac. “There’s not a lot of people in the industry who do a lot of thinking about rural multifamily.”

One of the white papers found that rental units in Appalachia, especially multifamily ones, are rare and represent a small fraction of the housing market. However, a high percentage of renters rely on subsidies to survive.

Of the 5.4 million residents in middle Appalachia, only 26.7 percent rent, compared to 36.4 percent nationwide. Only 16.7 percent of the renters are in multifamily units, compared to 42.6 nationally.

Many of them live in what Freddie Mac considers “other forms” of housing like RVs, houseboats and manufactured homes, according to Aber.

While the report found that the need for more affordable housing is great in Appalachia, it can be a struggle to get any projects off the ground.

Costs to build developments in Appalachia are not far off from the rest of the country and, paired with lower income of residents and potential rents, can scare off investors from the region, according to Guggenmos.

“[Investors] look at how much it costs to build and then they look at what the rents would produce and it just doesn’t pencil out,” he said. “It’s not driven by not wanting to be there, it’s driven by if there’s an opportunity. And it’s really hard to make those economics work.”

The high price to build projects starts with the geography of the region. The steep, mountainous slopes of many spots make it pricey to get the ground ready to install the foundation and it often needs septic systems and water lines built for the homes, according to McCullough.

“It’s money—lots of money—involved,” she said. “It’s not just propping [up] the house.”

The multifamily market also relies more heavily on the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) than other spots in the country but gets relatively few allocations.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issues the tax credits to buy, rehab or build affordable rental houses but only allocates a certain amount to each state per year. The rural Appalachia region generally only gets about 25 out of the 1,350 properties in the program annually, according to Aber.

“To build tax credit housing you need allocation of tax credits,” said Aber. “That’s not a very large allocation of credit to these areas.”

Even if they get LIHTC credits, it’s often not enough to cover the cost and keep a low debt load for projects in the area, like in the case of Boodry Place in Morehead, Ky.

Frontier Housing’s 32-unit Boodry Place finished in 2008 and is aimed to target seniors and families with children with disabilities that make 60 percent below the area median income, according to the report.

Since average incomes in the area are so low, the project can’t charge the maximum rents allowed in the LIHTC to cover the debt. One-bedroom apartments could only rent for $305, instead of the LIHTC max of $547, while two-bedrooms could only rent for $434, instead of $657.

Because of this, Frontier needed to keep a low debt load to break even on the $4 million project but only got $3.28 million in tax credit equity, so struggled to find other subsidies to make up the difference, according to the white paper.

It wound up with $280,072 in debt after getting $360,100 in State Affordable Housing Trust money, $140,000 from a U.S. Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 538 loan, a $120,937 developer loan, $100,000 granted from the Kentucky Housing Corporation, a $19,135 loan from the City of Morehead and a $10,000 Housing Assistance Council RCDI grant.

A spokeswoman for Frontier declined to comment for this story.

And while finding affordable multifamily housing in rural Appalachia can be a struggle, it can be nearly impossible in Freddie Mac’s other Duty to Serve focus: tribal land.

The report found that overcrowding and decaying homes are rampant in Native American areas, with roughly 40 percent considered inadequate. Elizabeth Bland Glynn, the CEO of Kansas City-based Travois, which helps build affordable housing on tribal land, said she’s seen places with no electricity, dirt floors and dangerous levels of mold.

“A lot of these homes are still from the 1930s and 1960s and they were built with poor materials,” said Glynn. “Most people think these kinds of conditions don’t exist in this country.”

The report found that homelessness is a widespread issue for tribal members and Glynn said she knows of tribes with waitlists of 15 to 40 families waiting for homes.

In addition to the other hurdles keeping investors away from rural Appalachia, investing in the Indian Areas also means approvals from a tribal council, according to Aber.

“It’s a market that’s maybe even less understood,” he said. “Understanding of the market and investment of the market can go hand in hand. It’s harder to attract investors who are not familiar with the markets.”

Despite this, Freddie Mac was able to seal its first loan on indigenous land in September with $22 million for Indianapolis-based TWG Development to build a multifamily complex on Kalispel Indians land near Usk, Wash., as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Glynn added it’s started to become easier for Travois to find investors as well compared to when it started 25 years ago, and it’s become a shorter process to fund projects on tribal land.

“It takes a while to help investors understand these deals,” she said. “They do look a little bit different, but they make an incredible impact and they’re worth all the headaches.”","The program—which Fannie Mae is also involved with—sets a three-year framework to build more affordable housing, preserve current ones and increase tax debt equity investment.

175,https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1440887/making-affordable-housing-sexy,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",EdgeProp.my,Making affordable housing sexy,"The design of affordable housing schemes have been pretty much the same everywhere – a few high-rise blocks that look like pigeon holes, a high density of small apartments with the typical 2-bedroom or 3-bedroom layouts.

It has been the same plain look for the longest time and budget-tight buyers are often left with no choice but to accept the banal offerings.

However, Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM) president Ezumi Harzani Ismail points out that the typical design of affordable houses actually prohibits a healthy living and social environment and will become costly for their occupants in the long run.

“When affordable housing price is lowered by the use of cheaper and lower quality materials or cheaper contractors, more maintenance needs to be done in the long run,” he says.

Furthermore, affordable housing schemes are usually located at the fringes of towns and residents would have to spend more time and cost on commuting to work compared with if they were to stay within the town.

“In the end, people own a house that does not increase in value but is costly for them to live in. The house price may be cheap but the cost of living is high after taking into consideration the long commute, the poor maintenance and the unhealthy environments,” he tells EdgeProp.my.

Thoughtful designs needed

Hence, a development that provides a conducive living environment within an easy and quick commute to work and business, should be the model for affordable housing, Ezumi posits.

Hence, he urges policy makers to look at enabling integrated or mixed developments to be built to give more live and work opportunities for residents as this will ultimately result in better household incomes and better housing affordability.

Besides the proximity to workplaces, the building design is also key to the success of an affordable housing project, notes PAM Council member Ang Chee Cheong.

He says the current design of affordable housing does not meet the needs of the people and it is causing affordable housing to be unpopular due to the unattractiveness of such schemes.

“Affordable housing is not being done right and the system and mechanism of provision is not a good one. You are just building to satisfy a statistical number and the responses are not optimum,” he points out.

Another issue is the rise of small-sized homes which Ang believes do not offer a conducive living environment for the owner.

“A house is more than just four walls, floor and ceilings. You need to have a certain amount of sizing. We are very much against the idea of micro-housing because we don’t believe it solves any problems by forcing people to live in 300 sq ft apartments. We are not Hong Kong, New York or London, so we shouldn’t go there,” he says.

The design and quality of affordable housing projects, he says, can be improved by adopting innovative ideas.

“I think [the design] can be substantially improved and this is where we can demonstrate innovative design solutions for a variety of sites to tackle current challenges,” offers Ang.

Ezumi says the industry needs to shift into a new era of affordable and sustainable housing development where the homes may not be as cheap as before, but are socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.

At the recently concluded Kuala Lumpur Architecture Festival 2018 (KLAF2018), PAM gathered some of the most creative minds in the architecture industry to showcase several future housing prototypes aimed at addressing the issues surrounding the affordable housing sector.

Here are four innovative design ideas featured at KLAF 2018.

1 Modular high-rise homes

A design by DP Architects Sdn Bhd features the possibilities that a modular high-rise home can offer the housing sector. The architectural firm proposes to adopt the concept of modularity, where the design of each unit is based on a module that can be combined with other modules to create larger homes for bigger families based on the life cycle of residents.

Besides responding to the different housing demands according to the residents’ growth and economic situation, this concept is expected to optimise cost, construction time and resource management of the building. It allows for the evolution and improvement of housing in the medium to long term, providing good living conditions for residents without large upfront costs.

2 Houses on top of existing highways

O2 Design Atelier Sdn Bhd has come up with a forward idea to address the issue of land scarcity in urban areas by building mass affordable housing on the space above existing highways.

Without the need for land acquisition, a big part of the cost could be used for building better quality homes.

The firm has chosen a stretch of the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport Highway, a major highway in the dense Petaling Jaya area where housing demand and price are high to demonstrate the idea.

The proposed housing project is integrated with a mass transit station while featuring car parks, communal gardens, sports facilities, a landscaped deck and retail space in the building on top of the highway.

Incorporated in the idea are innovative mini wind turbines installed at the flanks of the highway. These turbines, fed by the rapid speed of zooming vehicles on the highway, will generate energy to power the running of common facilities of the building.

The turbines, along with planted trees, also act as noise and air pollutant diffusers. Polluted air from the traffic below will be brought up through a tunnel with wet scrubber filters that eliminate pollutants and subsequently clean air is released into the podium facility area.

3 Extending above shophouses

CY Chan Architect believes shophouses in urban areas can be an alternative affordable dwelling typology to meet the needs of middle-income urban dwellers and offset the lack of affordable housing available within urban areas while creating a balanced, inclusive, sustainable community and liveable city.

The firm proposes to build 2-bedroom apartments on top of 2-storey or 3-storey shophouses that have become redundant due to changes in the economy by using 3m by 6m steel framing grids which tower over the shophouses as a support system.

Each of the apartments are composed of lightweight walls and pre-cast floor slabs for easy construction, which will reduce the overall construction cost and grant flexibility for future expansions.

The design of the apartments also introduces an expandable housing concept which features a 3m setback on each building facade to allow for future expansions based on the families’ needs.

The shophouses at the bottom, on the other hand, can serve as a housing lobby or a venue for residents to conduct daily activities.

4 A spiral high-rise building

One proposal brought up by Konzepte Asia Sdn Bhd is a spiral high-rise building with the units on each floor spread out like flower petals.

The design allows each unit to enjoy good ventilation and natural lighting while offering a conducive living environment for the residents. Common facilities such as the community hall, green areas, playgrounds and eateries are on the community levels.

Through these designs, the architectural firm hopes to begin a dialogue of creating housing that is meaningful and is able to strengthen communities and empower its inhabitants.

But with high-concept dishes like the 12-Hour Glazed Pork Belly or the Salmon & Green Curry, the joint always felt more like a treat or reward than everyday fare. And so DC fans and hungry office folk working in the Ortigas area clamored for more accessible meals that could be enjoyed in the café’s meticulously designed comics-inspired environment.

DC Super Heroes Café comes to the rescue with their Choose Your Own Adventure mix-and-match menu, a novel and fun way to have a lunch meal. Named after the book series that were hugely popular in the '80s and '90s, managing director Edric Chua says he wanted to pay homage to the stories that captured his imagination as a kid, much like how DC comics inspired the café. Reasonably priced at P280, the Choose Your Own Adventure meals give more diners a chance to try the concept café—that’s if they haven’t already.

Adventure is really the right way to describe the concept, as the menu offers the three main components of a dish playfully described as Energy, Strength, and Power, which you can mix and match to create your own super meal. The first step is to pick out Energy—they have a selection of six bases including skin-on mashed potatoes mixed greens, a garlicky aglio olio, pepperoni rice, aligue rice, and an oil-based fusilli pasta.

Then you choose Strength, your dish’s protein: Choose from soy-garlic beef strips, seared cajun chicken, calamares, crispy fried chicken, grilled dory, or fried pork belly. Finally, there’s Power, a sauce that’s poured over the protein, which can be any of another six options like a savory mushroom gravy, hearty romesco sauce, pesto, tangy tomato dressing, or lemon sauce.

Here's a fun fact: With 216 possible combinations, diners can visit DC Super Heroes Café every day for nearly two-thirds of the year and not have the same dish twice! Chua and his team tested all manner of combinations and proudly claim that everything works well with everything. Well, nearly everything. He confesses that since diners have varying palates, some combinations might not end up being a favorite.

For customers who don’t want to create their own meal, the café also offers a selection of chef’s picks called the Hero’s Path, or preset combinations inspired by members of the Justice League. Diners can, for example, choose to Fly With Superman (P280), a combination of creamy skin-on mashed potatoes, thinly sliced beef strips cooked in a punchy soy-garlic marinade, and mushroom gravy that’s as classic and American as the last son of Krypton himself. Seafood lovers can choose to Rule With Aquaman (P280) with a combination of sinful aligue rice, perfectly grilled dory, and a zesty lemon sauce that has just the right amount of tang.

Meanwhile, more adventurous diners can go with the daring Tinker With Cyborg (P280), which has a base of olive oil-coated fusilli paired with papel de liempo, crispy, paper-thin strips of pork belly, and drizzled with a nutty roasted-sesame dressing.

The portions are generous for the price, and the taste of each component is what you’d come to expect from a restaurant that conscientiously makes its own ketchup from scratch. The Choose Your Own Adventure menu is one of the most fun and creative ways to dine. Set against the backdrop of a superhero-themed café, the new lunch sets from DC Super Heroes Café is another exciting way to save the day from hunger.

DC Super Heroes Café’s Choose Your Own Adventure sets are only available from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday to Friday.

177,https://ehsdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/12/proposed-affordable-clean-energy-rule-polarizes-stakeholders/,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",EHS Daily Advisor,Proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule Polarizes Stakeholders,"Public comment on the EPA’s proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule closed October 30, 2018, and, as expected, the thousands of responses highlighted the radically diverse opinions on coal-fired energy and climate change held by Americans and industry stakeholders. The ACE proposal (August 31, 2018, Federal Register (FR)) comprised revisions of three existing regulations contained in the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan ((CPP); October 23, 2015, FR)—the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for existing coal-fired power plants; emissions guidelines clarifying the roles of the EPA and the states in implementing the BSER; and determining the applicability of New Source Review (NSR) permitting for existing power plants.



The ACE proposal was issued in conjunction with the Agency’s proposed repeal (October 16, 2017, FR) of the CPP. The objectives of the CPP and the proposed ACE are related but different in key respects. While both actions seek to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted by coal-fired power plants, the additional goal of the CPP is to pressure energy companies into shuttering older plants and replacing lost capacity with renewable energy or, at a minimum, natural gas generation, a fuel that produces about one-half the CO2 as combusted coal. In contrast, the ACE was designed to prolong the working life of those plants.

Both the CPP and the proposed ACE would result in reduced GHG emissions over a baseline scenario—i.e., no regulation at all—but reductions under the proposed ACE would be less. The current EPA has downplayed the differences, stating that the CO2 emissions under the proposal would be about the same as those under the CPP. But observers respond that there is considerable uncertainty about what ACE reductions would actually be since the proposal does not set numeric reduction limits as is the case with statewide budgets set under the CPP. The ACE limits would instead be established by individual states for individual plants. The proposal would increase the time states are provided to submit the relevant implementation plans for power plants to the EPA from 9 months to up to 3 years. Furthermore, the proposal would allow states to determine the appropriate compliance deadlines for affected units based on the standards of performance determined through the state plan process.

Much of the legal impetus behind the ACE proposal is the current EPA’s contention that the CPP exceeds the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA) because it endeavors to dictate the composition of the energy sector rather than pollution emitted by stationary sources. The CPP has a building-block approach to the BSER—improve the heat rate at coal-fired units; shift generation to lower-emitting natural gas units; and shift generation from fossil fuel units to renewable energy generation. In the ACE proposal, the EPA is seeking a singular definition of the BSER—heat rate improvement (HRI) at existing coal-fired units. In other words, the performance standards established for power plants would only reflect those emissions reductions that can be achieved through making existing plants more efficient. The proposal includes a list of the “most impactful HRI Measures”; these include neural network/intelligent soot blowers, boiler feed pumps; air heater and duct leakage control, variable frequency Drives, blade path upgrades, and improved O&M Practices.

The current EPA has acknowledged that implementation of the proposal may bring about a rebound effect, that is, efficiency gains may lead to increased electricity generation by fossil fuel-fired plants instead of relying on other electricity generation technologies, thereby increasing absolute emissions and, to some extent, offsetting the emissions reductions from HRI.

Under the NSR rules, major modifications of existing power plants may not proceed until the facility obtains a permit specifying that modern pollution control equipment will also be installed. To determine if an NSR permit is required, the facility undergoes an applicability test. The current applicability test regulations indicate that any facility that undertakes an HRI project may trigger the requirement for an NSR permit. Under the proposal, NSR would not be triggered by an HRI if the modification does not increase emissions on an hourly basis even if the modification increases annual emissions. An annual emissions increase is possible because an energy company will be inclined to operate a more efficient unit more hours in a year.

The EPA estimates that, overall, the proposed ACE will reduce costs when compared to the CPP by $700 million in 2025. The proposal would also result in what the Agency calls “foregone benefits,” that is, an increase in human mortality and illness resulting from persistence of copollutants such as particulate matter and ozone, which will occur in the absence of the CPP.

With that background, here are views the ACE proposal has prompted from experts and other stakeholders.

BSER

“The proposed ACE rule rests on a stronger legal foundation and a sounder economic analysis than the stayed CPP. In particular, the choice of a BSER based on heat-rate efficiency, a measure of CO2 intensity, is much more consistent with the Clean Air Act than was the CPP’s statewide budget approach.”—The George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center

“EPA’s ACE proposal provides an incomplete menu of technologies that nominally improve the heat rate of coal plants, but provides states the option of requiring nothing at all from power plants. The ACE proposal imposes no deadlines for implementing control measures to the extent that any are required. This proposal is inconsistent with the Clean Air Act, and it abandons EPA’s responsibility to take effective actions to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, which has been found by sound science to endanger public health.”—Howard A. Learner, Executive Director, Midwest Environmental Law & Policy Center

“The Clean Power Plan respects and harnesses what grid experts recognize as the defining feature of the U.S. electric grids: their operation as a single interconnected synchronous system. The CPP uses these features of the grid to advantage, allowing for and encouraging the reduction of pollution by shifting generation away from the grid’s dirtiest power sources. By working with the fundamental characteristics of the grid, not against them, the CPP results in lower-cost, meaningful pollution reduction. By contrast, the proposed ACE Rule aims to reduce pollution by drawing only from a tightly constrained set of measures that can be applied at individual facilities. Its focus is limited to a subset of measures that can be applied to sources on-site, namely, only those measures that result in HRI at individual coal-fired power plants.”—UCLA School of Law



Emissions

“Unlike the Clean Power Plan that would have required many of these units to significantly reduce generation or shut down, this proposal appropriately confines the requirements to what can be achieved ‘inside the fence line.’ This proposal also appropriately recognizes the important statutory role the states have in ultimately determining each individual electric generating unit compliance obligation based on unit specific factors considering EPA general guidance and determination of BSER.”—National Rural Electric Cooperative Association

“Under the ACE proposal, emissions of carbon dioxide and criteria pollutants will continue to decline more rapidly than if the CPP was withdrawn without replacement. Carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and mercury emissions will all be reduced by 2030 as compared to an electric power sector free of carbon regulations under the Clean Air Act. Altogether, ACE will lead to power sector carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 that are 33% below 2005 levels.”—U.S. Chamber of Commerce

“While the emissions intensity of coal plants declines by 4.5 percent, the number of coal plants in operation and total coal-powered electricity generation increase. This rebound effect offsets the benefits of emissions intensity improvements and causes the total emissions reduction to be small compared to the emissions intensity improvements. Total CO2 emissions are projected to increase at a number of the affected plants. Of the 333 model coal plants that would be in operation in 2030 under no policy, 93 of those (or 28 percent) are projected to have higher total CO2 emissions under the ACE. Additionally, under the ACE, five additional model coal plants are projected to be operating in 2030 that would have been idled or retired under no policy.”—Resources for the Future

State Authority

“The ACE proposal offers a framework that allows states to tailor their plans based on state and local market conditions and established emission policies. The proposal gives states the flexibility to regulate emissions at the plant level while considering factors like remaining useful life.”—American Public Power Association

“ACE emphasizes the authority of the states in both determining standards of performance for affected generation units and implementing and enforcing the rule.”—Montana Public Service Commission

“The proposed rule would remove the requirement that emission guidelines include information concerning known or suspected endangerment of public health or welfare by the designated pollutant. EPA ignores the fact that such information is crucial to development of state plans for pollutants whose regulation is justified in the first instance by such endangerment. The nature of a pollutant, its localized effects (if any) and information regarding its effective control must be provided to states so they can effectively develop their standards of performance.”—Letter submitted to EPA by 18 states, the District of Columbia, six cities, and 1 county

NSR

“Adopting an hourly test would help alleviate uncertainty about whether NSR permitting will be triggered when plant changes do not result in actual emissions increases. As EPA is aware, other types of applicability tests have resulted in determinations that emissions increases occurred when there were no actual emission increases, and in some cases, emissions actually decreased as a result of the project changes. For these reasons, INGAA recommends that EPA expand the applicability of the proposed hourly emissions test to all stationary sources and undertake a separate rulemaking to that effect.”—Interstate Natural Gas Association of America

“EPA’s proposal appropriately recognizes that the uncertainty and complexity created by the NSR program remains a significant obstacle to efficiency improvements. This uncertainty and complexity, however, is not limited to the utility industry. NSR rules similarly discourage other industries, like the refining and petrochemical manufacturing industry, from exercising the discretion to undertake energy efficiency improvement projects. As relevant to EPA’s current proposal, API supports the addition of an hourly emissions test within the existing major NSR applicability framework, because such a test would provide a simpler way of prospectively identifying whether a project will result in an emissions increase triggering NSR.—American Petroleum Institute

“Unfortunately, coal-fired power plants have a long history of exploiting ambiguities in NSR regulations—undertaking comprehensive, life-extending renovations but claiming (with varying degrees of success) that the upgrades do not qualify as “modifications” within the meaning of relevant Clean Air Act provisions and rules. By amending the NSR program in ways that make coal plant upgrades even less likely to trigger additional pollution control obligations, the Proposed Rule will, in effect, expand the grandfathering of old coal plants. As a result, it might also extend the economically useful lives of these highly polluting facilities.”—New York University School of Law","The objectives of the CPP and the proposed ACE are related but different in key respects.

178,https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/imagine-cleaner-affordable-canada-15452147/,"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Corporate Knights Magazine,"Imagine a cleaner, more affordable Canada","Imagine the Canada of 2025. Zero-emission vehicles putter across the country, silently saving the average person $1,500 a year on fuel costs. Homes and workspaces are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, with a fraction of the utility bills and virtually all of our power coming from zero-emission sources that make it easier for everyone to breathe. Our fossil fuel industries are pumping out clean commodities to satisfy the high and growing demand for global customers.

That world is within our grasp thanks to advances in technology, abundant clean power and natural resources, and the can-do mentality of Canadians. But it is not just going to fall into our laps.

Currently, we are one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases per capita in the world and the federal government’s latest projections show that the country will be spewing 722 million tonnes (MT) of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, a far cry from the 517 MT goal pledged in the Paris Agreement. A more hopeful projection that includes additional policies and measures currently under development would squeeze emissions down to 583 MT by 2030.

Canada needs a basket of common-sense policies (flex-regs) that present default choices that make life a little bit more affordable and comfortable for everyone. While a carbon tax can be helpful – to the extent it doesn’t politically derail the whole effort – it is not really where the action is, especially now that “renewables have gotten so cheap [in relation to fossil fuels],” in the words of Jim Barry, global head of BlackRock’s infrastructure investment group. To wit: The Clean BC climate change plan, which sets the new standard for climate policy in Canada, includes a rising price on carbon, but projects that it will account for less than 10 per cent of the province’s overall greenhouse reductions by 2030.

Here are four changes that could help move the clean-economy dial forward:

Institute zero-emission vehicle mandates that require manufacturers to sell a minimum and rising mix of non-emitting passenger and freight vehicles, similar to what’s being done in Quebec, British Columbia, California and China. This overcomes dealer inertia and helps put Canada in the driver’s seat for a world where electric vehicles will be cheaper than gas guzzlers in the next few years, according to Bloomberg.

Implement net-zero ready building codes for new buildings along the lines of the BC Energy Step Code and couple them with fuel-switching incentives and turnkey financing targeted at contractors to help decarbonize and climate-proof the existing building stock.

Move the coal phase-out up to 2025 from 2030, and hold auctions for renewable energy along the cost-effective lines already in place in Alberta.

Consider a public-private partnership styled after the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority to transform Canada’s abundant natural resources, including bitumen, into the world’s biggest storefront for clean commodities – a global market growing to $1.5 trillion annually by 2030.

Corporate Knights research has crunched the numbers to implement these suggestions and has determined that in an ambitious scenario, these policies could catalyze an additional $36 billion of investment per year from 2019 to 2025. They would also present significant opportunities for Canada’s financial sector to develop world-class expertise in green real estate and infrastructure financing as well as sustainable wealth management, the fastest growing asset class at scale in the world. This approach has the potential to generate billions of dollars in returns for Canadian pensioners and shareholders.

In return, Canada’s emissions would plunge to 571 MT by the end of 2025, and living standards, our GDP and jobs would rise.

Zero-emission vehicles putter across the country, silently saving the average person $1,500 a year on fuel costs.
Our fossil fuel industries are pumping out clean commodities to satisfy the high and growing demand for global customers.
Canada needs a basket of common-sense policies (flex-regs) that present default choices that make life a little bit more affordable and comfortable for everyone.

They nailed the net-zero part.,"Steve Tuckner admits he failed.

His goal: To build an “affordable” net-zero home.

So he picked an affordable neighborhood: St. Paul’s North End. Sold the spacious three-bedroom abode in Roseville where he lived for decades. Moved with his wife and two dogs into an apartment — and hired builders. That was over a year ago.

“Is what we did financially sensible? Hell, no. I’m gonna lose a ton of money on it. … We’re likely gonna die there, because we won’t get the cost back,” Tuckner admits. “I did it because I believe in it. What we did is on the bleeding edge of what you can do.”

Now, the 1000 block of Loeb Street will have a home worth three times the cost of anything next door, across the street or down the block. It’s 1,060 square feet, a single story with no basement — and all for the low, low cost of $400,000, not including the lot. It likely will be the North End’s first “net-zero” home.

“I was surprised when I got an address out of them,” said Ryan Stegora, an Apple Valley builder working as a consultant on the project. “All right, add the North End to the areas where there are high-performance homes.”

“Net zero” is energy-efficiency parlance for eating what it produces; maybe a little less. With a 4-kilowatt solar farm on the roof, 15½-inch-thick walls of poured concrete and foam, a 9-square-foot battery, high-performance air exchangers and a sealed plastic “smart vapor barrier,” Tuckner thinks it’ll be up for the job.

He — if not his wife, initially — got on the “net-zero” kick years ago, after visiting the renowned “House in the Woods” in North Hudson, Wis.: a spare-no-expense home built for more than $1 million.

That home had a symphony of bells and whistles. Solar panels that tracked the sun, weather-resistant exterior shades, wastewater heat recovery, you name it.

The owner of the house, Gary Konkol, had been reluctant to release the hard costs of his build — worried he would scare away less-affluent energy-conscious families.

But he needn’t have worried with Tuckner.

“We’re a three-Prius family,” Tuckner laughs. That is, he and is wife share a Prius between them, and his daughters, of course, each have one.

All joking aside, as a software engineer, “I like the idea of building something that is inherently very efficient. It’s not about adding a lot of solar,” Tuckner says. Sure, Konkol’s home was expensive — adhering to a more extreme, certified standard of energy efficiency called a “passive house” — but at least it answered a big question: Could you build a furnace-free home that could brave northern winters?

As the years went by, another question arose: How cheap could you go?

Tuckner’s wife, Angela Jerome-Tuckner, had been reluctant to find out. Sure, they were empty-nesters living in an increasingly vacant house, but the opening debates had been about upgrading. Not moving. The Roseville house they occupied for 19 years had always had everything they wanted: multiple upstairs bedrooms, a fenced yard, an attached garage. The new house, it would later turn out, has none of those.

But the cost to retrofit the Roseville home, adding appliances, new windows and insulation — including digging around their foundation — ran between $100,000 and $150,000.

“A hundred fifty to live in the same house,” Tuckner says, shaking his head.

Jerome-Tuckner admits a shake-up of that size was easier to stomach, since they had so many recent changes — her husband’s (now in remission) cancer diagnosis, their daughters’ graduations and her mother’s death.

After all that, “No, no, I really do like the idea,” Jerome-Tuckner now says.

Their goal was to find inexpensive land in the city, and a Ramsey County foreclosure auction turned up the North End lot for $13,000.

It was scary at the start, after some additional costs with an architect. They eventually decided to go without one, relying on builders and a consultant with a track record for net-zero builds.

And there were surprises. Even though they went without a basement, it would’ve cost the same to have one. The house that had been torn down on the lot left some shaky land, and they ended up having to pour concrete eight feet deep in places. That was $30,000 they could’ve saved.

Now, the frame is up, the walls are poured and wrapped, and Tuckner hopes the project will be done by February.

As for bells and whistles, “It’s about as bare-bones as I’ve seen. The solar is probably their one big expense — but if you want net zero, you have to have it,” building consultant Stegora says.

Still, the primary reason for the hefty price tag lies in the walls themselves: 6 inches of poured concrete, surrounded on each side by nearly 3 inches of insulated, Lego-like “concrete form” foam, with another 4 inches of foam inserted in the middle for good measure. No wooden two-by-fours. All that wrapped by a semi-permeable plastic barrier.

“The concept is very simple: highly insulated, and sealed up tight,” Tuckner says.

“It’s virtually an indestructible structure. It’s inert to moisture. … And these homes are super quiet. Once people live in them, they don’t want to live in anything else,” Stegora said. “The ones that go through with the build are typically not first-time homebuyers. Middle-aged, grown kids, owned more than one home.”

Without exception, neighbors admit to having as much sticker shock as the Tuckners did.

“How much?” asked an agog Judy Berg, who’s lived across the street from the Tuckners’ lot for 46 years. “All they did is raise our taxes!”

“I thought (Tuckner) was kinda crazy because of that,” said Angel Stettner, who lives next door. “But if you’re gonna live there until you die, it’s the quality not the quantity, I guess. If you’re comfortable.”

Stettner said she thought about buying the lot herself, but is happy to have the Tuckners as neighbors. “It sounds perfect for empty-nesters. Watching it being built is super interesting. They have foam, like Legos, in the walls.”

Joe Bowman, owner of Minneapolis-based Conscious Living Institute, the general contractor on the build, said the Tuckners could’ve saved a little on the walls — maybe $10,000, with a less expensive product that arranged the foam differently.

But all in all, if you take out the $30,000 the Tuckners lost on the extra work for their foundation, his net-zero low-ball estimates are about the same.

“It might be between $350,000 and $375,000, depending on the square footage, for a two- or three-bedroom with a basement,” Bowman said when asked the minimum a net-zero house might cost.

Those wanting net zero, he noted, don’t always have to go to such extremes with the walls.

“If you throw enough solar at it, you can get to net zero without doing any of the performance stuff,” Bowman said.

But Stegora said most of his clients are more concerned about resiliency and efficiency — not so much the fact that a home is pumping wattage from the sun.

Yes, Tuckner says, he failed in his goal.

“Our goal was to build an affordable net-zero. We didn’t do that. But we tried.”

And — given his anxieties about climate change — he’s comfortable living in that failure for the rest of his life.

“I’m not saying it’s going to save the world. It’s a stupid idea, it’s an obsession, all that, whatever. But one thing it will be is resilient,” Tuckner says. “It’s the kinda house that, given what’s coming, it’s the best thing for me, and my wife.”","It’s not about adding a lot of solar,” Tuckner says.

Her endorsement of Medicare-for-All, which would provide government Medicare coverage to every American, is supported by 70 percent of the country, according to a poll from Hill.Tv and Harris Polling Company.

Ocasio-Cortez, who worked as a waitress and bartender to supplement her mother's income after graduating from Boston University, has repeatedly dominated headlines for speaking out against political norms and established practices.

She is leading a plan to create a special congressional committee on climate change and, along with other legislators, is also promoting drastic shifts in the country's approach to climate change.

The ""Green New Deal,"" a play on the extensive government programs, public work projects and financial reforms that President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented to boost the economy during The Great Depression, suggests shifts to clean energy within 10 years. The plan, although currently in its incipient phase, ""intends to push climate change, clean air and water, pollution and unhealthy environmental conditions in poor and minority communities to the forefront of the agenda of the new Congress that will convene in January. They also are pressing lawmakers to stop accepting political contributions from fossil fuel companies,"" NBC News reported.

At the end of last month, Ocasio-Cortez railed against the use of tear gas against migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, comparing those seeking refuge in the U.S. to Jews during the Holocaust.

""Asking to be considered a refugee & applying for status isn't a crime. It wasn't for Jewish families fleeing Germany. It wasn't for targeted families fleeing Rwanda. It wasn't for communities fleeing war-torn Syria. And it isn't for those fleeing violence in Central America,"" she wrote.

183,https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Demand-for-affordable-housing-far-outstrips-the-13488633.php,"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",CTPost,Demand for affordable housing far outstrips the supply,"Daisy Franklin was living in a comfortable home in Norwalk with her two children and the man she thought she’d marry.

But when the couple split amicably, it became clear she’d need to look for other living arrangements for her family.

Staying with her ex wasn’t an option, and on her minimum hourly wage as an electrician at the manufacturing company Harrell’s Inc., her options on the private rental market were limited. One opportunity arose, living in a shared apartment with three other women, but Franklin and her children — one in middle school and one in elementary school at the time — would have had to share a single room.

“It could’ve worked, but for how long?” Franklin wondered.

Despite some misgivings — what about crime, gangs, drugs? — Franklin decided to add her name to the waiting list for public housing.

Steep housing costs

In Connecticut, where home prices and rents are some of the highest in the nation, demand for affordable housing far outstrips the supply.

To afford a two-bedroom rental, a Connecticut resident on average needs to make $24.90 per hour or work 99 hours a week on minimum wage, the National Low Income Housing Coalition found in 2018. That’s the ninth-highest housing wage in the nation.

“The housing stock in Connecticut is not made for people making minimum wage,” said Christie Stewart, director of Fairfield County Center for Housing Opportunity, a newly formed nonprofit based in Bridgeport. “I’ve worked for years for a shelter provider. You walk through those shelters, those people are all employed.”

In Fairfield and New Haven counties, housing costs climb higher than the rest of the state. The Stamford-Norwalk region is the fifth most-expensive U.S. metropolitan area for renting a two-bedroom apartment, the 2018 NLIHC report found.

In the New Haven area, an individual must make $24.98 an hour — $51,960 a year — to afford the average two-bedroom apartment. But in the Fairfield County suburbs, it’s about $34 per hour in Norwalk, $46 in New Canaan and Westport, and over $57 per hour in Greenwich, North Stamford and Weston.

“Having safe, sanitary, stable affordable housing is really key to folks working their way out of poverty and I don’t think there is nearly enough of that around,” said Adam Bovilsky, executive director of the Norwalk Housing Authority. “Some families do become what we refer to as economically homeless, which is if they can’t afford the rent, they can be evicted and become homeless temporarily even if they have working members of the family earning income, just because it is too difficult to afford everything — your food, your clothing, your medicine — when your housing becomes so expensive.”

The result is half of Connecticut renters and about a third of homeowners spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the Hartford-based Partnership for Strong Communities found in January. The U.S. government considers housing affordable when individuals spend 30 percent of their income or less on it.

The brink of homelessness

With so much income going toward housing, one life event — a job loss, health emergency, domestic violence — can sometimes push individuals to the brink of homelessness.

For Lisa, who declined to use her last name, the deciding factor was being laid off from the insurance titan MetLife, when she was nine months pregnant. She had lived in Bridgeport for years and was trying to finish her undergraduate degree at Sacred Heart University.

About to become an unemployed single mother, she applied for subsidized housing in several Fairfield County towns and waited four years before being accepted in Westport.

Considered one of New York City’s bedroom communities, Westport has seen a change in the people seeking housing assistance in recent years.

When the 2008 financial crisis hit families with investments hard, Carol Martin, executive director of the Fairfield and Westport housing authorities, saw multimillion-dollar homes being foreclosed on.

“Some of those families ended up on our wait lists,” Martin said. “I’ve spoken to several people who that has happened to locally and the first thing out of their mouth is: I never thought I would be in this position.”

But for others, an unstable home has been a part of life since birth.

Abandoned by her mother with a mostly absent father, Zola Richardson, 27, spent her toddler years in foster care until a great-aunt took her in.

A self-described “hard-headed teenager” with abandonment issues, at age 18, she left the Hartford Job Corps Academy with another trainee, seven years her senior, and lived with him in the Bronx. She was pregnant.

“It was seven years of ups and down, shelter stays, couch stays. That was a long-dragging relationship. That is all my kids know,” Richardson said of the stress and negative impact from their itinerant lifestyle in the New York shelter system.

In New Haven since July 2016, her daughter, 8, and her son, 7, now are enrolled in the same school for the second year in a row, which provides some stability, but their housing is precarious.

Richardson and the children had a stay in Spooner House in Shelton, before getting an apartment through the state’s Rapid Re-housing program. Unable to contribute enough to the rent after nine months, she was evicted and ended up in another shelter.

Richardson said it feels like a Catch-22. She has to be working to qualify for the day care for her third child, a 6-month-old son. But the minimum-wage, part-time jobs she has done can’t cover utilities and rent, and while she again qualifies for an apartment, she fears the outcome will be the same.

“My kids deserve something permanent,” Richardson said.

Affordable housing gap

Unable to find cheap market-rate housing, local and state wait lists for affordable housing are sometimes thousands of people long.

Affordable housing can be provided in many ways such as subsidized private development, government-funded housing and state or federally funded housing vouchers.

But despite state and federal investment, there is a gap: in Connecticut in 2018, 140,531 households were deemed “extremely low income” — $29,500 or less for a family of four in Bridgeport, or $42,100 or less in Stamford/Norwalk — but only 51,050 affordable rental units were available. That’s less than one affordable unit for every three extremely low-income households.

“It’s getting much more difficult to find housing, even if you have a job and make decent money,” said Anthony Johnson, executive director of the Greenwich Housing Authority. “Places that used to be rentals have been torn down and turned into private homes. There are some new affordable buildings and other types of housing coming in, but the rate we’re losing them doesn’t match the rate they are being replaced at.”

Finding affordable housing is a problem for people with higher incomes, such as those making up to 80 percent of the area median income. They, too, qualify for assistance.

In the New Haven area, that threshold is $73,520 for a family of four; in Bridgeport, $75,040; in Danbury, $93,040; and in Stamford/Norwalk, $107,920, according to the Department of Housing’s 2018 income limits.

The people living in subsidized housing run the gamut, according to the executive director of the Fairfield and Westport housing authorities.

“We have folks that were homeless. We have frail elderly people. We have old and young folks that are employed,” Martin said. “We have town staff, single-income families with two and three children ... we really have everything.”

A place to call home

As for Franklin, she spent more than three years on a waiting list, during which time her concerns about living in the projects had not subsided. But with high demand for apartments and higher rents, she had only a few choices: find a shelter, burden a family member, or move to Roodner Court, a Norwalk housing project to which she’d been accepted.

With her children, Franklin moved into Roodner Court more than a decade ago and quickly found her ideas about public housing dispelled. She began making friends, leading regular cleanups of the hallways and grounds, taking leadership roles — she is a member of the Norwalk Fair Housing Advisory Commission and the Residents Advisory Board — and, most of all, discovering beauty in Roodner Court.

Franklin and her children were safe. They had a place to call home. In the projects, a sense of pride emerged.

“Having a home is important to me. I don’t want to wake up in the morning and find out I don’t have housing,” Franklin said. “It’s my address, it’s my home. Clean, dirty, whatever — it’s still my home.”","Steep housing costsIn Connecticut, where home prices and rents are some of the highest in the nation, demand for affordable housing far outstrips the supply.
The U.S. government considers housing affordable when individuals spend 30 percent of their income or less on it.
Affordable housing gapUnable to find cheap market-rate housing, local and state wait lists for affordable housing are sometimes thousands of people long.
Affordable housing can be provided in many ways such as subsidized private development, government-funded housing and state or federally funded housing vouchers.

On top of similar moves by Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the demise of the Cruze adds to growing affordability challenges in the new-vehicle market. The continued death of cars is happening amid record-high prices and rising interest rates, but also shifting consumer tastes. Some dealers anticipate buyers will continue to gravitate toward compact utility vehicles or perhaps just defect from the American automakers that are shedding cars like birds molting feathers.

Consumers feel that affordability pinch especially when automakers drop car segments and focus more on crossovers, SUVs and pickups, said Chad Martin, a Bowling Green, Ky., dealer selling 12 brands including Chevrolet. And while some are loyal to a specific brand, customers generally seem to be shopping for a particular type of vehicle, such as compact cars. So if an automaker eliminates that option, those shoppers likely will turn elsewhere.

""What this is going to mean is, you're going to see a somewhat higher defection rate because you don't have the product lineup that particular consumer wants,"" said Martin, president of Martin Management Group.

GM said last week it would end production of the Cruze as part of a cost-cutting plan that would idle five North American plants and significantly trim hourly and salaried positions. GM also will stop production of the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Volt throughout 2019.

Ford already said it will end sales of all sedans in North America as it transitions to a lineup heavy on crossovers and SUVs. FCA decided in 2016 to axe the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 cars.

Price will be a bigger hurdle for buyers who want to stick with one of the domestic brands. Many compact crossovers are $5,000 more than their compact sedan counterparts, Martin said. ""Obviously, the consumer is going to have to absorb that $5,000 difference,"" he said.

According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for all compact cars this year through October was $20,623 vs. $28,448 for compact crossovers or $24,559 for subcompact crossovers. Automakers and dealers expect consumers moving out of compact sedans such as the Cruze to largely turn to the subcompact crossover segment.

Dis-car-ds

Since FCA decided in 2016 to phase out the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200, 13 other Detroit 3 cars have been slated to go. Those nameplates accounted for over 1 million sales in 2016, about 850,00 last year and more than 510,000 in the first 9 months of 2018. 2017 2016 Chrysler 200 18,457 57,294 Dodge Dart 10,082 43,402 Ford C-Max 18,390 19,834 Ford Fiesta 46,249 48,807 Ford Focus 158,385 168,789 Ford Fusion 209,623 265,840 Ford Taurus 41,236 44,098 Buick Cascada 5,595 7,153 Buick LaCrosse 20,161 27,582 Cadillac ATS 13,100 21,505 Cadillac CT6 10,542 9,169 Cadillac XTS 16,275 22,171 Chevrolet Cruze 184,751 188,876 Chevrolet Impala 75,877 97,006 Chevrolet Volt 20,349 24,739 Total 849,072 1,046,265

Craig DeSerf, general manager at Gulf Coast Chevrolet-Buick-GMC in Angleton, Texas, said he was not surprised larger sedans such as the Impala and LaCrosse are going away: ""With millennials coming along and these younger [buyers] coming along, the big sedans — I hate to say it — they're just dead.""

But DeSerf was surprised GM plans to do away with the Cruze, especially before canceling Chevrolet's smaller Sonic or Spark. ""If the car can stay under $18,000, it's a phenomenal car,"" he said of the Cruze. ""We sell the heck out of them used.""

While GM has not announced any plans to pull the Spark from the mini segment or the Sonic from the subcompact segment, there are rumblings that the Sonic could be discontinued. But those little cars' volumes pale in comparison to the slightly larger Cruze.

Through October, GM sold an estimated 19,407 Sparks and 18,265 Sonics vs. an estimated 124,536 units of the Cruze. Though sales are down an estimated 22 percent for the Cruze this year, it was still the fifth-best-selling model among compact cars, with 8.5 percent of the segment. It is being outsold by the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra and Hyundai Elantra.

In sixth place in the segment is the doomed Ford Focus, which sold 105,203 units during the period, down 21 percent. Across the segment, sales are down 14 percent this year, underscoring the well-noted reality of U.S. consumers migrating from cars.

Even so, compact cars overall accounted for 1.46 million vehicle sales through the first 10 months of the year, still a hefty number and nearly a third of all car sales.","With General Motors set to end production of its Chevrolet Cruze compact car next year, another high-volume, entry-level option will be crossed off American car buyers' shopping lists.

But sometimes travel rewards can help keep traveling with your animal affordable.

Here are a few things to consider when planning pet travel, and tips on how to keep the costs down.

What is the hotel’s or Airbnb’s policy for leaving your dog in the room?

If the hotel or Airbnb you’re staying in has a policy of never leaving your dog in the room by itself, you’ll need to also budget for local pet-sitting services or day care.

If you’re gone for a few hours, services such as Rover will help you find an experienced dog walker, and the first two walks are free. Pet-sitting services are priced similarly to babysitting services. Expect to pay at least $10 per hour, though pet day care services may cheaper. We pay $25 per day in New York, while other people I know pay $35 per day. Generally, expect to hire a pet sitter if you need to leave your pet at night.

How much are the pet fees?

Hotel pet fees can range from $0 to $100 per stay, or nightly rates of up to $50. Even chains that may have a stated price could vary by location. Alternatively, Airbnb pet fees are set by individuals. I’ve been charged $0 to $5 per night or $40 per stay.

But unlike a hotel, Airbnb pet fees can be negotiated. I responded to the person who asked for $40 per stay that my dog was well behaved and I’ve never had a pet fee for an Airbnb on other trips. The host dropped my fee to $20.

What rewards perks make traveling with your pet cheaper?

If you are using travel rewards to book lodging where you have choices among multiple hotels, call individual hotels to check their pet policies. If you can get a free or cheap room at a hotel that doesn’t forbid you to leave your pet in the room, you’ll save on both pet-sitting services and the hotel room itself.

Because pet policies can differ within a chain, having a travel rewards credit card with multiple hotel options is important.

Does the hotel have amenities for your dog?

Some do. Kimpton Hotels offer toys, treats, clean-up bags and water bowls for your pet.

You should generally plan on bringing or buying your dog’s food from a local pet store. Some boutique hotels will have doggy menus to treat your pooch, although the food may be pricey.

Are there pet-friendly options to get to the hotel you choose?

If the local shuttle services don’t accept pets, you could end up paying a much higher price to get to the hotel. It helps to call the hotel concierge and ask about transportation options both to the hotel and around town.

Additionally, find local attractions or outdoor restaurants that allow pets. I’ve visited quite a few hotels recently that will serve your pet indoors in seating areas outside of the restaurant.

Released in 1947, the film revolves around a historical footnote to World War II.

After the war ended, discharged soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen flooded home. In New York City, the setting for the movie, many vets couldn't find a place to live. My dad was one of them, so the film is especially poignant to me.

In It Happened on Fifth Avenue, a veteran handcuffs himself to a bed to protest his eviction from an apartment house that is set to be demolished and replaced with an office building. The landlord's minions carry him out, bed and all. A couple days later, he runs into the feisty wife of an Army buddy. She's sitting on the tailgate of station wagon filled with boxes, her young son beside her. The veteran asks where they're living.

""Right here,"" she retorts. ""How do you like our penthouse on wheels?""

Few Christmas tales - except the one that started it all - focus so intently on young families searching for shelter. Most striking is how sympathetic the movie is to its homeless characters. The film is simplistic, to be sure, but it also confirms a truth: Ordinary, trustworthy people, folks we can imagine as neighbors and colleagues, can wind up homeless because of social and economic trends beyond their control.

That's a relevant message now, especially in North Texas and other regions experiencing shortages of low-cost housing. Through no fault of their own, a lot of working people cannot find a decent place to live.

New York City had a postwar housing crisis because the Great Depression had halted new construction for more than a decade. Then the war effort diverted labor and materials to defense needs. After the war ended, and all those GIs came back, an already tight housing market tightened more.

In Dallas in the late 2010s, the housing crisis has a different cause: a fast-growing economy. This region has added tens of thousands of jobs annually and attracted tens of thousands of workers to fill them. But wages are mediocre. Between 2013-2017, the median household income in the city of Dallas was about $47,000, and about $54,000 countywide.

Meanwhile, North Texas added few new moderately priced houses or apartments. According to RENTcafé, all the new apartments completed in Dallas-Fort Worth in the first six months of this year were ""luxury"" units, as were 98 percent of those that came online last year. People are working, but they can't afford rent. It's like having $10 in your pocket and needing to eat, but there's no McDonald's around, only a Morton's Steakhouse.

Worse still, developers have been tearing down older apartments and smaller houses that low- and middle-income families could afford, especially in the neighborhoods closest to downtown.

In the movie, the veterans become squatters in a Fifth Avenue mansion. Then they devise a plan to remodel closed military barracks into inexpensive apartments. That actually happened in real life. City authorities in postwar New York and Los Angeles built villages of surplus Quonset huts to shelter young families. It was only a temporary solution, but city officials recognized that the problem was housing, not the people needing it.

The only thing ""wrong"" with many North Texans who currently live doubled up in crummy apartments or decrepit rent houses is that there's no place to go they can afford. I was broke and making barely more than minimum wage when I moved to Dallas, but cheap rentals were abundant then. That gave me a chance to pay off student loans and stash money away for retirement.

Today's low-income North Texans don't share that good luck. We could improve the situation by welcoming moderately priced homes into our towns and neighborhoods. We could allow builders to scatter well-designed duplexes or triplexes in upscale areas instead of more 4,000-square foot single-family houses. We could view affordable housing as infrastructure, something vital to our long-term economic and community health, and invest significant public and philanthropic dollars in it.

The movie got it right. The problem isn't people. It's a lopsided market that isn't producing enough lower-cost places to live.

When you’re on a beer and pretzel budget and can’t afford a down payment on a free meal, it’s impossible to even think about the purchase of a high-tech suspension system for your Chevelle, Camaro, Nova, or fullsize Bowtanker.

“This is a significant move. It is a welcome move, especially when it is a sensitive segment that generally buys it. Also because third party insurance is mandatory, the cost of compliance will come down”, Anup Rau, Chief Executive Officer, Edelweiss General Insurance Company Ltd told BusinessLine.

Sanjay Datta, Chief of Underwriting, Reinsurance and Claim at ICICI Lombard General Insurance said this move has more of a societal impact and will make such products “more affordable” for those who need to buy third party, but found them difficult to afford.

Sasikumar Adidamu, Chief Technical Officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance said:” We welcome this move as it will be beneficial for the consumers by giving them relief in terms of reduction in GST rates, which will result in reduction in their premium outgo”.

Adidamu said this will help the insurance industry improve the penetration of motor third party insurance which is mandatory in the country.

Subrata Mondal, Executive Vice President of IFFCO Tokio General Insurance said, “This is a welcome move considering it will bring down the premium rate for vehicle owners. The reduction has brought relief to vehicle owners at a time when the cost of insurance recently went up due to mandatory long term Third Party cover”, Mondal said.

Divyesh Lapsiwala, Tax Partner, EY said this GST rate cut should reduce the premium and possibly increase penetration given that some of the goods carriers may not be registered, and therefore GST would be a cost to them.

This would, however, have a major impact on the technology systems of general insurance companies given the fact in a single policy two different rates will apply on two different components of the premium, Lapsiwala said.

The company will sell a 2 BHK in Nelamangala, 24 km from Bengaluru, for ₹14 lakh beginning April.

“In South India, there is no institutional play in real affordable housing as most homes are available upwards of ₹30 lakh. We formed Megalith only to cater to the requirements of EWS and lower income group (LIG) and won’t do any other product under this brand,” Mallanna Sasalu, founder and CEO, Megalith Ventures, told Business Line.

Mass manufacturing

The company will follow the mass manufacturing model, where it will replicate the same architectural design, layout and floor plans across all projects, saving operating costs. The homes will use pre-cast technology, where building elements like slab, roof, beams and columns are custom designed, and then joined at site, reducing the time by up to 64 per cent compared to conventional methods.

“We have entered into an MoU with a Finnish company for providing machineries and will undertake onsite manufacturing. So we will go for projects with a minimum area of 20 acres to bring in economies of scale,” said Sasalu.

The buildings will be modular in nature, without basements or stilts, but will offer open parking.

“These measures will bring down cost of construction per sq. ft. to ₹1400 compared to ₹1800-₹1900 that most developers currently incur. Our selling price will be ₹2800-₹2900 per sq. ft., which is lower than others but still profitable for us,” said Sasalu.

City on the Outskirts

Megalith will focus on projects only on the outskirts, where the city has already grown substantially. The company has acquired three land parcels around Bengaluru.

The Nelamangala project is spread over 24.5 acres and will have 3900 units with price tags of ₹10 lakh and ₹14 lakh for one and two bedroom homes respectively.

“Nelamangal is surrounded by four industrial townships and nearly 80 per cent of the target buyers don’t travel to the main city for work. We are targeting these workers who can afford to replace their rent with EMIs for homes,” he said.

The other two projects will come up at Bidadi and Samana Attibele.

“We have decided to procure land either through outright purchase or go for joint development. Customers will be identified through surveys around the project location and we will also help them avail loan and subsidies,” Sasalu added.","In an industry struggling with high costs and low margins, Bengaluru-based Megalith Ventures is looking to mass manufacture homes, to make them affordable for the economically weaker sections (EWS), while ensuring they remain close to employment opportunities.
