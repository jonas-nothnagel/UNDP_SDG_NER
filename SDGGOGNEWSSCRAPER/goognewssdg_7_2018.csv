The communication initiative notes that it is time to turn worldwide enthusiasm for the SDGs into action, and the targets are meant to guide engagement on a personal level.

Target icons are available when clicking on the associated SDG. An abbreviated title for each target is included next to its icon, along with the original textual formulation of the target.

A Global Goals for Sustainable Development press release notes that enthusiasm for sustainable development is “stronger than ever,” and that expanding the communication system for the Goals can help ensure enthusiasm is turned into action. The targets are “the real working parts of the Goals,” it notes, as they provide a detail list to guide engagement on a more personal level.

As agreed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 17 SDGs are accompanied by 169 targets: seven targets for SDG 1 (no poverty); eight targets for SDG 2 (zero hunger); 13 targets for SDG 3 (good health and well-being); ten targets for SDG 4 (quality education); nine targets for SDG 5 (gender equality); eight targets for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); five targets for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); 12 targets for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth); eight targets for SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); ten targets for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); ten targets for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 11 targets for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); five targets for SDG 13 (climate action); ten targets for SDG 14 (life below water); 12 targets for SDG 15 (life on land); 12 targets for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and 19 targets for SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).

The Global Goals for Sustainable Development website is hosted by Project Everyone, a not-for-profit agency devised by Richard Curtis, filmmaker. Project Everyone is executed by a team of communications and campaign specialists working in partnership with a range of organizations to ensure that everyone knows about the SDGs.

To address this issue, the UN SDG Action Campaign is encouraging people to engage in SDG implementation and monitoring, while the IAP, a global network of science agencies, has published a guide to the SDGs for its members.

Market research conducted jointly by PepsiCo, Paragon Partnerships, and the UN SDG Action Campaign found that just 5.9% of 10,000 people interviewed in the Philippines were aware of the SDGs, with this percentage falling among lower-income respondents. The survey also found that poverty, hunger and ill health were the issues of most concern to respondents, corresponding to SDGs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The majority of respondents (68.2%) believed that the situation with regard to these concerns had not changed in the past year, while about a quarter (28%) felt the situation had improved.

Commenting on the results of the Philippines survey, Dilek Ozler of Paragon Partnerships expressed hope that more country governments will choose to measure progress and promote SDG implementation. Paragon Partnerships is a network of government, research agencies, NGOs, companies and client organizations that seeks to use data to generate insights for policy making and programme development towards SDG implementation.

The UN SDG Action Campaign is an initiative of the UN Secretary-General administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The campaign supports countries and the UN system to promote public engagement in SDG implementation. Among its activities are the MYWorld 2030 platform for data sharing and citizen engagement and the ‘World We Want’ partnership with civil society for hosting SDG-focused consultations.

Separately, the IAP, a global network of science, engineering and medicine academies, conducted a survey of its members, which likewise found limited awareness of the SDGs. The IAP has published a 20-page guide to “demystify” the structures and processes by which the SDGs are to be implemented, and to encourage scientists to apply their knowledge to the challenge of implementation. The guide titled, ‘Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guide for Merit-Based Academies,’ includes a database of peer-reviewed publications on the SDGs that academies have produced since 2014. The activities are part of a three-year IAP project that began in 2016, and seeks to promote the global science community’s contribution to SDG achievement.

2,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/netherlands-conducts-audit-for-national-sdg-preparedness/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Netherlands Conducts Audit for National SDG Preparedness,"January 2018: Countries’ national supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have begun carrying out assessments of preparedness to achieve the SDGs. The Netherlands recently issued its review, while Canada has announced plans to conduct one. In total, more than 100 SAIs have shown interest in carrying out SDG-related audits, according to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).

SAIs are independent governmental entities with an external audit role established by a constitution or supreme law-making body. They primarily oversee public expenditure but, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), they are increasingly taking a broader, more comprehensive view to address reliability, effectiveness, efficiency and economy of policies and programmes. INTOSAI is an umbrella organization for the external government audit community, promoting development and transfer of knowledge, improving government auditing worldwide and enhancing professional capacities. It is an NGO with special consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

In December 2016, SAIs gathered for the biennial International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (XXII INCOSAI), in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The agenda for this meeting included the theme, “How INTOSAI can contribute to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including good governance and strengthening the fight against corruption”. The INTOSAI website includes a section for ‘Audit reports produced by individual SAIs on the SDGs;’ the Netherlands’ review of preparedness to achieve the SDGs is the first report on this list.

The Netherlands’ review concludes that the government has made a “swift and well-organised start,” but there are “a number of areas that require attention to ensure a lasting long-term impact.” The review was carried out by the Netherlands Court of Audit (NCA), and its conclusions were conveyed to the House of Representatives of the Dutch Parliament in a letter of 13 September 2017. Per the letter, the NCA conducted the review from March to June 2017, based on a seven-step framework it developed with the European Court of Auditors. The framework’s steps include a firm commitment on the part of the government to achieving the SDGs, the involvement of society as a whole and of all relevant stakeholders, and the development of a suitable system for monitoring progress. The letter recalls that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation wrote to the House of Representatives in September 2016, presenting a plan of action for SDG implementation, and indicated that the Netherlands would strive to achieve all Goals by 2030. It also states that Statistics Netherlands issued its first SDG monitoring report on 4 November 2016.

The review points to a number of areas the Dutch Government needs to pay special attention to, in order to “ensure the successful and coherent achievement of the SDGs in the longer term.” These areas include: raising awareness of the SDGs in the education curriculum; analyzing the impact of government policy on the ability of subnational authorities and others to reach the SDGs, and vice versa; and examining how the SDGs can be included in the regular budget and accountability cycles of the government.

A “light-touch approach” to coordination may not be sufficient to avoid conflicts or overlap among policies, the review finds.

The review stresses the need to ensure clear coordination and assessment of policy proposals in order to avoid conflicts or overlap, and suggests that the “light-touch approach to coordination” by the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation may not be sufficient. It highlights the importance of considering the impact of any policy proposal (whether positive or negative) on one or more of the SDGs, and discusses the relevance of using an SDG assessment tool in this regard.

The review was based on interviews with: the national coordinator for the SDGs; the SDG ‘focal points’ at various ministries; Statistics Netherlands; the international division of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG); Partos, a partnership of development organizations; and members of the Netherlands’ SDG Charter, which involves companies, public authorities and NGOs. It also used public sources.

The Abu Dhabi Declaration resulting from XXII INCOSAI outlines the importance of undertaking audit and review work on the SDGs through four different approaches, which are defined in INTOSAI’s Strategic Plan 2017-2022: assessing the preparedness of national governments to implement, monitor, and report on SDG progress; undertaking performance audits that examine the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of key government programs that contribute to specific SDG aspects; assessing and supporting, as appropriate, the implementation of SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and being models of transparency and accountability in SAIs’ own operations, including auditing and reporting.

Canada is expected to issue a full review of its preparedness to achieve the SDGs in April 2018.

3,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-initiatives-to-unleash-big-data-for-sustainable-development/,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches Initiatives to Unleash Big Data for Sustainable Development,"1 December 2017: The UN has launched several initiatives to strengthen countries’ use of big data for sustainable development, including a 12-point plan on privacy and governance issues. The UN System Staff College (UNSSC) with the Data-Pop Alliance launched a platform offering online courses on big data in November 2017, and will conduct face-to-face trainings in 2018. The UN Statistics Division with the GIS software company Esri have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to monitor progress on the SDGs.

The Data-Pop Alliance is a coalition of research and development actors created by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, MIT Media Lab, and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to promote the use of big data for sustainable development through research, capacity building, and community engagement. UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are seeking to promote data literacy within the UN and other development practitioners. Their learning platform, the ‘Big Data & Sustainable Development Open Learning Hub,’ offers a series of eight consecutive modules over 11 months. The online modules became available in November 2017 and will run until mid-September 2018. The first module covered issues of governance, transparency and politics related to the use of big data, and subsequent modules will address: climate change; citizen-generated and mobile phone data; gender equity; public health; emergency response; data collection, gaps and opportunities; and data storytelling and visualization. The program can be accessed by anyone who creates a profile on the learning hub.

UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are also offering in-person training on ‘Leveraging Big Data for Sustainable Development.’ The training is conducted over three to four days, and is offered in French and English at various locations around the world. A French-language programme will take place in Dakar, Senegal, from 6-8 March 2018, and an English-language programme in Bangkok, Thailand, from 27-29 March 2018. The training programme is meant to strengthen the skills of UN staff and development practitioners in selecting, creating, using and interpreting data in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Hewlett Foundation is supporting fellowships to cover the costs of the course to professionals from public sector institutions, civil society and academia.

On 30 November 2017, the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management endorsed the concept of a “federated system” of open SDG Data Hubs. The federated system facilitates the role of national statistical offices (NSOs) in managing statistical and geospatial data through an open data platform with software for GIS and data analytics, as well as through the use of web-based tools for communication and user engagement. It seeks to strengthen national and global statistical systems in managing and sharing data and good practices in implementing the SDGs, improving data interoperability, and enhancing relationships between national and global data. The concept has been implemented through initial research conducted by the UN Statistics Division (UNStats) and Esri, which have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to collect, analyze and share data for monitoring progress on the SDGs.

Also on big data, Emmanuel Letouzé and David Sangokoya of the Data-Pop Alliance have proposed a 12-point plan addressing privacy issues in big data. In a paper titled, ‘How to Use Big Data,’ developed in cooperation with the Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications, the authors recommend that collected data be encrypted and stored in distributed data repositories, where it can only be accessed for legitimate purposes. They call for directing big data projects and resources toward solving shared problems, and for communicating results of projects through data visualizations.

Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

The companies are working on this transition with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-registered charity whose mission is to accelerate the shift to a circular economy. The companies that made the pledge are behind many household consumer brands and include: Amcor, Ecover, Evian, L’Oréal, Mars, Marks & Spencer, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, Walmart, and Werner & Mertz. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that the 11 companies making the pledge are responsible for six million tonnes of plastic packaging every year.

The companies announced their pledge at the launch of the WEF Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). The platform is open to companies, organizations, and governments to create innovative partnerships for decoupling economic growth from resource use. Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever, called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

The CEO of Unilever called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

In the lead-up to Davos, Coca-Cola announced its goal of collecting and recycling “the equivalent” of every bottle or can that it sells by 2030. The company has launched its own plan, ‘World Without Waste,’ which focuses on the life cycle of materials used in its packaging. In an op-ed first published on Medium.com, James Quincey, CEO and President, highlighted the company’s efforts towards this goal, including: the introduction of ‘PlantBottle’ in 2009, a container made from up to 30% plant-based materials; cooperation with the plastics industry to promote recycling activities in Mexico; and its sponsorship of coastal clean-up exercises through the NGO Ocean Conservancy.

McDonald’s announced that all its consumer packaging around the world will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources, preferably sources that have a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. In 2017, just 50% of the company’s consumer packaging came from such sources.

The global packaging company Amcor was the first to take the recycling pledge. Ron Delia, CEO, highlighted this as a key step in differentiating the company as a global leader in the packaging industry.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is leading a three-year initiative, the ‘New Plastics Economy,’ which seeks a shift towards the sustainable use of plastics. The Foundation also partners with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and others to promote the circular economy. On 5 December 2017, the organizations organized a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, on the role of the circular economy in the transition towards a pollution-free planet, together with the EU, WEF, Chatham House, and the Institute for Development Studies (IDS). The event discussed global action on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), and highlighted examples of actions and policies for enhancing resource efficiency, discouraging unsustainable consumption patterns, and redirecting investment for a clean and circular economy.

The IYOR aims to strengthen global awareness of the value of coral reef ecosystems, promote partnerships, and identify and implement effective management strategies for the conservation, sustainable use and resilience of reef ecosystems.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment), the primary threats to coral reefs are rising temperatures, ocean acidification, pollution, plastics and sediments, destructive fishing practices, and overfishing. The UN Action Hub has highlighted that the average period between bleaching events has been cut in half since 1980, with episodes of severe bleaching occurring twice as frequently. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) primarily address the conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs under SDG 14 (life below water).

In conjunction with the IYOR, Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced the nomination of its Great Sea Reef as a Ramsar site. The designation aims to protect large portions of Fiji’s Great Sea Reef from climate change, wastewater and chemical pollution, and other threats. In a statement, Bainimarama said the nomination aims to conserve the area for future generations. A Ramsar site is one designated as a wetland important for global biodiversity conservation and human well-being, and the Convention’s broad definition includes coral reefs.

Pacific reefs are in better shape than many other coral reefs around the world.

Further, UNEP announced the forthcoming launch of an analysis of Pacific coral reef status by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN). The report finds that the structure and types of corals in Pacific reefs are changing, which affects the ecosystem services provided by these reefs, particularly fisheries productivity. Still, the report finds that Pacific reefs are in better shape than many other coral reefs around the world.

UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim also called on the world to combat the decline of coral reefs and address plastic in the world’s oceans. Solheim explained that corals may eat microplastics and larger plastic debris can break or smother corals. He stressed, “This is a make or break year for the world’s coral reefs.” To address marine litter, UNEP has spearheaded the UN Clean Seas campaign, and announced, in October 2017, that Spain had joined, bringing the total number of countries to 32.

Finally, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) Director General, Kosi Latu, called for improved management and protection of coral reefs, urging increased collaboration to “respond to climate change, manage waste, conserve and restore biodiversity and support strong governance.” Latu said SPREP has established a two-year campaign, the Pacific Year of the Reef, to address these issues.

The targets address actions to foster circular design strategies and to increase the volume of garments that are collected, resold and reused.

Following a commitment made in May 2017 at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit to support the fashion industry’s transition to a circular economy model, 64 international fashion companies have set targets to support the development of circular fashion strategies by 2020. The participating companies commit to actions in four areas: implementing design strategies for cyclability; increasing the volume of garments collected; increasing the volume of garments resold; and increasing the share of garments made from recycled post-consumer textile fibers.

The participating companies submitted a total of 143 individual targets, with many focusing on increased training and research for circular design strategies or implementing circular design principles. Targets in the other categories provide for specific quantities or shares of garments collected, resold and recycled.

The companies represent approximately 7.5% of the global fashion market, including popular brands such as adidas, Zara, Hugo Boss, H&M, Lacoste, Target and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as several luxury brands and labels focusing on sustainable clothing. The individual commitments have been published on the Global Fashion Agenda’s website.

The Framework lays out gender-sensitive requirements and guidelines to ensure that gender equality is a core feature of project design, assess gender impacts, and incentive projects that pro-actively address gender gaps. The framework will enable developers to access funding from a growing number of “gender-lens” investors by quantifying and certifying gender impacts based on best practices.

The Framework’s guidelines address key steps and tools to ensure gender equality in project design and implementation, including: consultations; safeguards assessments; gender baseline analysis; and measurement of progress towards goals. It also provides examples of possible gender targets, such as: increasing girls’ school enrollment and graduation rates; increasing income generation opportunities for women and equal pay; or improved access to financial mechanisms for women.

The Gender Equality Framework becomes part of the ‘Gold Standard for the Global Goals,’ a certification standard that aims to ensure that climate action projects also contribute to the SDGs.

Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman.

11,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-sanitation-economy-the-new-economy-set-to-tackle-sdg-6-2/,"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Sanitation Economy: The New Economy Set to Tackle SDG 6.2,"The news often reports the desperate lack of access to safe sanitation faced by a staggering 2.3 billion people globally. Around the world, one in three people still lacks access to a toilet, and hundreds of thousands of children die annually from diarrheal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. There is an abundance of heart wrenching stories to share.

To address this challenge, in 2015, the global community adopted a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). Target 6.2 under this Goal calls for, “by 2030, achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation.” This article discusses the untapped opportunity for the private sector to help achieve SDG target 6.2. Not only can business be a part of the solution that provides clean water and sanitation for all, but it can make a profit at the same time.

So, where do we begin? From the outset, overcoming this global issue is daunting. Where do we look for the solution, when the issue includes complex cultural nuances, societal taboos, and the general ‘yuck’ factor?

To start, the global business community and savvy entrepreneurs can take a closer look at the bottom of our toilets. Yes, it may sound unpalatable, but there is method in the madness.

The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

In its latest report, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) introduces the ‘Sanitation Economy‘ – a market that presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses. This new economy monetizes toilet provision, products and services, biological resources, health data and information, to provide benefits across business and society.

This research shows that the market could be worth US$62 billion in India alone, by conservative estimates; it could turn trillions of liters of human waste into valuable biological resources each year; and it could hold a vast reservoir of information about human health.

It is rare today to find white spaces in the economy open for business and innovation, and that address such an urgent global challenge as outlined in SDG 6.

The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies. They include: the Toilet Economy, which encompasses toilet product and service innovation that provides toilets fit for purpose for all environments and incomes; the Circular Sanitation Economy, which means toilet resources (commonly known as human waste) feed into a circular economic system that replaces traditional waste management; and finally, the Smart Sanitation Economy, which involves digitized sanitation systems that optimize data for operating efficiencies, maintenance, plus consumer use and health information insights.

The Toilet Economy

Providing basic access to a toilet and the sanitation systems that safely manage human waste is a serious issue. Access to “sanitation for all” made the least progress during the era of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that spanned from 2000 to 2015. As a result, the world is now watching, and acting, to ensure progress over the next 15 years under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.

The Government of India is leading the way with its ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Clean India Campaign’, which aims to provide universal access to all Indians in just five years (2014-2019), become open defecation-free, and build more than 100 million toilets. The campaign is making swift progress in providing access to toilets and awareness is high among citizens. China is now following in its footsteps.

It is not just national governments rising up. Citizen movements are also encouraging behavior change. In November 2016, the Global Citizen Festival was held in Mumbai, India, to put a spotlight on the need for sanitation for all. About 100,000 citizens gathered to listen to an impressive mix of celebrities, musical artists, and sanitation experts – including Coldplay, JAY-Z, and famous Bollywood stars about the importance of sanitation. In 2017, Bollywood launched ‘Toilet: A Love Story,’ a film about a woman who turns down a marriage proposal until her husband-to-be agrees to buy her a toilet. Such cultural activities help educate people about the importance of sanitation and drive behavior change alongside the creation of toilets.

The Circular Sanitation Economy

The past decade has seen business embrace sustainable development, where private sector practices address growing constraints on resources and new responsibilities for the customers and communities they serve. Leading corporations have found new market opportunities by looking at where their unique value propositions can also address unmet needs, and market failures that underpin the SDGs, where no one is left behind. The circular economy – the mining of waste and available resources to save costs and generate new revenue – is trendy among global businesses.

Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources. If what goes into our toilets has value, those interested in extracting that value will invest in ensuring that the resource is properly managed.

And there is no shortage of this resource. Approximately 7.6 billion people globally create excreta every day, to the tune of 3.8 trillion liters of resources – an amount that is growing with our population growth. These resources, when captured and mined, present very interesting biological resource use cases.

For instance, entrepreneurs and businesses are starting to monetize these resources and are creating valuable products such as nutrient-rich organic fertilizers, electricity, bio-fuel, water, and proteins. All of these products were previously, and in many cases, are still, flushed down the toilet. From manufacturing operations to municipalities, there is growing demand for these new, renewable resources and organic or biological products. They help fill food, fiber, agriculture, animal feed, consumer goods and healthcare needs.

The Smart Sanitation Economy

The future of industry is being shaped by what the World Economic Forum is calling the fourth industrial revolution – a digital economy. This is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Sanitation and toilets have a place here, too. There is a key opportunity now to apply new technologies and digitization to sanitation to create new business opportunities as future sanitation systems are developed. While the Smart Sanitation Economy is the least developed area of the Sanitation Economy to date, we believe that it could be a game changer for how we view our sanitation and toilets into the future. It can provide valuable data and insights on health, and for sanitation system operating efficiencies.

A Call to Action – Making ‘Your Business’ Business

The Sanitation Economy is the business response to a global crisis and resulting market and societal failures. With collaboration and investment on all fronts, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s toilet-related resources and data into valuable, life-saving resources and critical information.

This is our call to action to the global business community – because sanitation is every business’s business. It’s time to step up and be counted.","The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

Released in cooperation with Bertelsmann Stiftung, this year’s edition of the study included additional metrics for the SDGs analysis along with several refinements to the methodology, leaving the results ""not strictly comparable"" with those of prior editions, according to the report.

The Kingdom obtained the best results in its performance on the SDG No. 1: No poverty, which the report considered as achieved based on statistics indicating that no citizen earns less than $1.9 per day.

“The SDG Index is a tool to engage stakeholders around overall progress made on SDGs. There is a strong correlation between poor and crisis affected countries and lower SDG Index rankings. Jordan ranking 5 in the Arab states means there are potential areas for improvement including availability of data for some of the SDGs and strengthening national data systems to monitor and report on progress,”

Sara Ferrer Olivella, country director, Jordan UNDP, told The Jordan Times.

Human rights researcher Sulaiman Sweiss told The Jordan Times that he ""doubts"" the reality of such advance, noting that ""even the official figures show an increase in poverty in the past years, not to mention the last raise on the price of general goods such as bread, which will continue to burden the less privileged.""

Hunger, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, industry innovation and infrastructure, life below water and life on land were the SDGs in which Jordan performed the worst, according to the study.

""Jordan went backwards on the official rankings released by the UN in the past years and I am not optimistic about the performance next year,"" Sweis said, noting that ""we can not advance in the SDGs within the huge gender gap that we are still experiencing, with women accounting only for the 13 per cent of the workforce in Jordan.""

""The SDG Index and Dashboards is aimed at assisting countries to identify priorities for action in order to achieve the 17 SDGs,"" the report said, pointing out that ""the indicators and dashboards should help countries to pinpoint key implementation challenges.""

In this regard, Gender Consultant at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Reem Aslan told The Jordan Times that ""the participation of women in the economy is very low,"" noting ""the need to provide women with a better working environment and a better work-life balance.""

Low wages, sexual harassment at work and the lack of transportation from home to the workplace are some of the issues preventing women from engaging in the labour market, according to the expert.

""When you look at the statistics you don't find women over 50 in the workplace,"" Aslan highlighted, noting that ""the Social Security Law allows women to retire at an early age without warning them about the financial loss that comes with it, and many of them do not even have the chance to work because they start taking care of their parents once their children emancipate.""

""In addition, we don't believe that the government or the employers are aware of the importance and the benefits of having more women in the workforce,"" she continued, noting the presence of studies aimed at raising awareness on the matter.

""However, we are starting to witness a mental shift derived from the work of non-governmental organisations,"" Aslan added, expressing that ""we are lucky to have a few ministers committed with this issue, such as the minister of Social Development or the minister of Education.""

Regarding the regional picture, Algeria topped the Arab world ranking achieving the 64th position worldwide, followed by Tunisia (65th), Morocco (73th) and the UAE (77th).

Lebanon stood close to Jordan achieving the 86th position worldwide, closely followed by Egypt (87th). Bahrain (92nd) and Oman (94th).

When asked about the regional scenario, Sweis highlighted the similarities between the official UN ranking and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network's ranking, noting that ""many countries in the region have improved their situations despite the challenges they are facing, while Jordan remains in a very similar situation when compared to the previous years.""

""The SDGs are not only about the economy and the statistical figures, they are about human rights,"" the researcher added, calling on the government to ""reconsider the policies in this field if they want to see real advances"".","AMMAN — Jordan has ranked 80th worldwide and 5th in the Arab world in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Dashboards Report recently issued by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which analyses the SDGs performance of a total of 157 countries out of the 193 UN member states.

The report assesses LDCs’ economic trends and progress towards selected SDG targets and indicators.

Only five LDCs reached the SDG 8.1 ambition of sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in 2017.

The 2018 report titled, ‘Selected Sustainable Development Trends in the Least Developed Countries,’ was presented to UNCTAD Member States at a meeting of its governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, on 5 February 2018. The assessment finds that LDCs economic growth averaged 5% in 2017, and should reach 5.4% in 2018, which is below SDG target 8.1 on sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the LDCs. According to the report, in 2017, only five LDCs achieved this target: Bangladesh (7.1% GDP growth), Djibouti (7.0% GDP growth), Ethiopia (8.5% GDP growth), Myanmar (7.2% GDP growth) and Nepal (7.5% GDP growth).

The report shows that aid to LDCs remains far below the target of 0.15-0.20% of donor countries’ official development assistance (ODA)/gross national income (GNI), a level that was agreed in 1981 and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development in 2015. It notes that in 2016, only a handful of donor countries appear to have met these commitments: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK provided over 0.20% of their own GNI to LDCs, while the Netherlands met the 0.15% threshold.

The report also shows that aid tends to be skewed towards a relatively small pool of LDCs, with the top ten recipients accounting for roughly half of total disbursements to the group. The top recipients are often the countries most affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict, the authors find.

The assessment indicates that levels of external indebtedness have been surging across LDCs, and in 2016, remittances accounted for as much as 31% of GDP in Nepal, 29% in Haiti, 26% in Liberia, 22% in the Gambia, 21% in the Comoros, 15% in Lesotho, and they exceeded 10% of GDP in Senegal, Yemen and Tuvalu. It also finds that many LDCs fall short of the inclusive and sustainable industrialization envisaged in SDG target 9.2 (Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in LDCs).

Comprehensive and updated economic and social statistical data on the LDCs can be accessed in UNCTAD’s ‘Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries – 2017.’ [Publication: Selected Sustainable Development Trends in The Least Developed Countries] [UNCTAD Press Release on Report] [UN Press Release on Report] [UNCTAD’s Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries 2017]","8 February 2018: A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) suggests that the least developed countries (LDCs) will not reach the SDGs unless key action is taken, including speeding up wholesale restructuring of their economies.

Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General, remarked that at the global level, there are many examples of local actors taking steps to implement the 2030 Agenda, including in South Africa, the Philippines and Benin.

At the event titled, ‘Poverty Eradication: From Policy to Local Action,’ Mohammed noted that local and regional governments only participated in 57% of the VNRs, which is “not enough.” Talking about Nigeria, she noted challenges faced by the country, including internal conflicts linked to the insurgence of Boko Haram. She also outlined initiatives undertaken by various stakeholders to make progress on the SDGs, such as the launch of the first country-level private sector advisory group (PSAG). The PSAG seeks to provide guidance and strategic support to achieve the implementation of the SDGs in Nigeria, and includes 13 key partners who share a commitment to achieving the SDGs and an interest in corporate social responsibility.

Samson Itegboje, Permanent Mission of Nigeria, outlined other initiatives taken by his country to reduce poverty and target the ones left behind, including: the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-2020, which seeks to enhance global competitiveness, and invest in people and in environmental sustainability; the Home Grown School Feeding programme that provides free nutritious school meals to children; the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP) that provides financial aid for the un-banked and under-banked; and conditional cash transfers. He noted the need for local coordinators to monitor implementation of national plans and programmes and ensure transparency.

Yahaya Hamza, Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs), Nigeria, said his office is working with the Ministry of Budget and National Planning to mainstream SDG indicators and targets into the budget and into sectoral plans. He noted that Nigeria has established the National Women Empowerment Fund (NAWEF) and the National Social Investments Programmes (NSIP) to tackle poverty and hunger across the country, and that efforts taken by the country in several sectors are starting to yield results, as indicated by falling inflation and “unprecedented’ infrastructure investments.

Bettina Luise Rürup, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES), said poverty eradication requires a broad variety of work, such as promoting gender equality, including youth and creating employment. She called for “disaggregating partnerships” to better understand how and with whom to engage. Vince Chipatuka, FES Zambia, highlighted evidence that social protection can reduce inequality and poverty, and should be considered a right and an investment, instead of a “cost” or “charity.”

Rosario Diaz Garavito, The Millennial Movement, Peru, stressed the need to engage with civil society organizations (CSOs) to involve those left behind, adding that the 2030 Agenda Peru Ambassadors Program has reached people in 21 regions of Peru. The Programme is promoted by The Millennials Movement, the World We Want Platform and the UN Inter-Agency Network for Youth Development, and seeks to facilitate participation of CSOs in the 2030 Agenda and the SDG process at the country level.

Enemona Adaji, University of Nottingham, UK, said countries should invest in youth as leaders and social entrepreneurs to help design SDG solutions. A representative from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) outlined the importance of inclusive growth, saying it should provide decent employment opportunities for people, especially young people, and be sustained over a long period of time.

The side event was organized by Worldwide Network Nigeria: Women in Development and Environment, and convened on 6 February 2018, in New York, US. CSocD 56 is taking place from 29 January-7 February on the theme, ‘Strategies for Eradicating Poverty to Achieve Sustainable Development for all.’

16,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/halting-deforestation-from-aspiration-to-action/,"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Halting Deforestation: From Aspiration to Action,"Imagine an area the size of Belgium, blanketed by forests and trees which provide food, fuel, medicine, shelter, and incomes for local habitants while conserving soil and water for farms and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.

Now, imagine that area stripped entirely of its trees. This is the amount of forest area lost to the world each year. The total cost of this deforestation is immeasurable, with impacts extending far beyond the forest itself.

Once forests and trees have disappeared, so too will the integrity of the soil and water systems they supported — often permanently. Approximately 75% of all freshwater for farms, industry and homes comes from forests and wetlands. Forests also sequester more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem, and when they are destroyed, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, impacting adversely on the global climate.

Deforestation’s negative impacts for people and the environment are thus far-reaching and serious. Increased forest loss also means that, without major corrections in land use, the world will fail to meet crucial global targets, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Deforestation threatens achievement of forestry targets under the Goals, as well as SDGs on eradicating hunger and poverty, preserving health and fighting climate change — which rely heavily on the goods and services that forests provide.

To put this degree of interdependence into perspective, we need to look at SDG 15 on ‘Life on Land.’ In July, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards this Goal, which calls for, by 2020, promoting the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and substantially increasing afforestation and reforestation globally. These are highly ambitious targets. SDG 15 requires the world to ensure that through the sustainable management of forests, we also protect biodiversity; restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; and halt and reverse land degradation.

None of these measures can be achieved if forests are not at the heart of policies, development strategies, and actions that go far beyond the forest sector.

This is because many drivers of deforestation lie outside the forest sector and are rooted in wider social and economic issues, including challenges related to reducing poverty, and policies that favor land uses that produce higher and more rapid financial returns, including energy, mining, transportation, and agriculture.

Further, a growing world population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 makes it critically important to find ways to feed people while maintaining and expanding forests to meet other human needs.

This can be done.

Research published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has shown how, over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover. Food production can expand through agricultural intensification and other important policy measures. Ghana, Tunisia, and Viet Nam are just a few examples from very different countries that all show strong results when decision-makers coordinate policies across sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, land-use planning, and rights to land tenure.

Over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover.

Sharing expertise and increasing awareness is a critical part of this process. Governments at all levels must work closely with indigenous peoples, community representatives, private-sector associations, and international organizations. Corporate responsibility commitments by large companies operating in the agricultural sector are equally important. An inclusive and broad engagement can lead to a re-evaluation of the role of forests in agriculture production. Innovative technology must be shared and applied to a greater degree, international financial instruments and private-public partnerships considered, and governance issues, including tenure, reviewed.

There is no time to waste. Halting and reversing deforestation globally presents an enormous challenge and will require both political will and concerted action across all sectors at all levels. This effort may influence pivotal decisions expected this year when the HLPF takes stock of progress toward the SDGs in July. This will, in turn, influence follow-up actions by States, business, and civil-society partners at all levels. With collective action now, we can address the global challenge of deforestation, achieve our targets, and ensure that the world today, and in the future, continues to enjoy all of the goods and services that forests provide.

Forum Chair Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, released the summary of the 2017 Forum.

The annual high-level event took place on 14 October 2017, in Washington, DC, US, during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings. The Forum gathered heads of government, ministers and central bank governors from small States, as well as representatives of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth Secretariat, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the IMF. The 2017 edition of the Forum marked the first time that private sector institutions participated at a large scale, including Swiss Re, World Economic Forum, Bitt.com and the World Ocean Council.

The four main issues raised during the 2017 Small States Forum, according to the summary, are: vulnerability; International Development Association (IDA18) implementation; de-risking; and partnerships. The summary also highlights the importance of mobilizing public and private sector financing for renewable energy, for green and blue economies, and for technology. Also, according to the summary, Forum Members welcomed the ‘Roadmap for World Bank Group Engagement with Small States,’ which was prepared by the World Bank in May 2017.

On vulnerability, participants underlined that small States’ susceptibility to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, frames the challenge of quickly mobilizing and disbursing considerable financial resources to countries that may not have easy access to concessional development finance. The World Bank can mobilize finance quickly in the aftermath of an emergency and provide additional resources for countries that otherwise would not be eligible for it, including by using the IDA Crisis Response Window and creative price buy-downs using trust fund resources. However, the Members noted, some vulnerable small States, such as Nauru and Palau, are unable to access either IDA or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, as they neither qualify for the IDA small States exception nor meet the credit standard for IBRD. They called on the World Bank to explore financing solutions for such vulnerable small States that “fall through the cracks.”

On the IDA18 implementation, participants welcomed the “massive increase” in IDA resources available for eligible small States (US$1.9 billion, which is more than double the previous allocation), noting that for some countries, the IDA allocation has quadrupled. The Forum observed that the challenge is to now find transformative projects that can absorb and make the most of these extra resources. The summary explains the need to focus efforts on preparation, front-loading and fast-tracking (available) development financing, and using innovative financial instruments and creating new partnerships to mobilize additional public and private sector resources.

On de-risking, the Forum noted that as financial institutions seek to “de-risk,” they are causing the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships in small States. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda proposed the establishment of a working group to address the development challenges of de-risking for small States.

Participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and nontraditional partnerships.

On partnerships, participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and non-traditional partnerships. Development partners agreed to continue working together to improve opportunities for small States to access development finance that reduces their vulnerability to shocks.

Several private sector innovative mechanisms were also discussed, including: a new form of blockchain technology that builds direct financial connections to manage remittances and address the challenge of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relations; private insurance that acts as a financial shock absorber, providing fiscal space during natural disasters; and technology to ensure the traceability of tuna so that small States can significantly increase their revenue.

Leaders highlighted the role of political will, community engagement and targeted investment in changing practices and lives, stressing that FGM can and must be stopped.

The Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality (SDG 5) target 5.3 aims to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM by 2030. According to the UN, global prevalence of FGM has declined nearly one-quarter since 2000 but the rate of progress is insufficient to keep up with population growth, meaning that the number of total cases is expected to continue to increase without additional action. In addition, by 2030, one-third of births globally will be in the 30 FGM countries, a trend that will require accelerated progress to protect women and girls from this practice.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.”

In his message for the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.” He called for accelerating progress on SDG target 5.3, saying that, without immediate action, “a further 68 million girls could be subjected to this practice by 2030.” Guterres stressed, “sustainable development cannot be achieved without full respect for the human rights of women and girls.”

In a joint statement for the Day, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Natalaia Kanem described FGM as a “violation of human rights that both reflects and perpetuates the low status of girls and women” and can cause infection, childbirth complications and death. The leaders highlighted building momentum to eliminate FGM, observing that over 25 million people in more than 18,000 communities across 15 countries have disavowed the practice of FGM since 2008. Fore and Kanem stressed that ending the practice helps girls to grow up healthier, better educated and employed, and more empowered to make decisions about their lives.

In countries where UNICEF and UNFPA work jointly to end FGM, the UN finds that girls are one-third less likely to undergo FGM than in 1997. The UNICEF and UNFPA Executive Directors highlighted conditions that help to end FGM, including when governments, communities and families address the issue; when women and girls are empowered to make their voices heard; when villages confront social norms; when access to education, health and legal services support sustainable change; when medical professionals refuse to perform FGM; or when laws make FGM a crime and authorities enforce the law.

According to the UN Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC), many women and girls in European countries are also subjected to FGM, particularly migrants from countries where FGM is practiced. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 20,000 women and girls coming from countries that practice FGM apply for asylum in European member states annually, including for reasons related to FGM. UNRIC explains that FGM continues to exist among migrant groups after migration to Europe, with girls particularly at risk when they temporarily return to their country of origin during holidays.

The Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, said the FGM “is not acceptable in the 21st century” in her remarks at an international forum in the Gambia on strategies to combat FGM. Gambia banned FGM in November 2015. Wickramanayake called on countries to address gaps in their legal frameworks to end the practice of FGM.

Hawai’i will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge.

The Hawai’i State Senate aims to focus on a local platform to implement the SDGs during the 2018 Legislative Session. The 2018 Senate Legislative Program outlines Hawai’i’s goals for each of the 17 SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the Program states that Hawai’i will ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have “equal rights to economic resources by implementing and enacting appropriate measures and social protection systems.” On SDG 14 (life below water), Hawai’i will continue its commitment to strengthen its “resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters” in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change. On SDG 15 (life on land), Hawai’i aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of its “’āina and natural resources by integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into local and state planning.”

The Senate will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge, a local sustainability framework that aims to improve the quality of life for future generations. The Aloha+ Challenge focuses on achieving sustainability goals in clean energy, local food production, natural resource management, solid waste reduction, smart and sustainable communities, and green workforce and education. The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard tracks Hawai’i’s progress in these areas. On natural resource management, the Dashboard focuses on increased freshwater capacity, watershed area, marine managed areas, invasive species control and native species management and notes whether each area is being measured or is near its target. For example, on watershed area, Hawai’i is near the 2030 target of 253,000 areas of native watershed under high-level protection. The state has increased is protection of priority watersheds from 10% (90,000 acres) to 15% (132,000 acres) since 2011, and has plans for tripling the areas protected. For each of these areas, the Dashboard provides information on how users can learn more about the issue and contribute to making a difference.

On local food production and consumption, the Dashboard describes current challenges Hawai’i faces in developing a sustainable local food system and outlines the state’s goal of doubling local food production by 2030 by building on Hawai’i’s history of agricultural innovation and abundance. Users can track progress by dairy, protein, vegetables, fruit and starches.

J. Kalani English, Hawaiian Senate Majority Leader, said the 17 SDGs will “continue to build a more resilient state and improve the quality of life for future generations.” In the introduction to the legislative program, he stresses that Hawai’i is recognized as a “global leader in addressing sustainability and climate change challenges, building on a history of systems-thinking and traditional knowledge.” [Hawai’i Senate Press Release] [Hawai’i 2018 Senate Legislative Program] [Aloha+ Challenge]","17 January 2018: The Hawai’i State Senate announced its intention to enact the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into state law to achieve the sustainability of Hawai’i’s people, communities, natural resources and economic prosperity.

In last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, we saw the possibilities that blockchain technology holds for development finance. This week’s brief considers where and how private sector actors can contribute to SDG achievement, including through blended finance.

Blended finance is the use of public or philanthropic investment to attract commercial finance from the private sector, particularly to fund activities in developing countries. The private sector contains many types of entities: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), multinational corporations (MNCs), institutional investors, individuals, and everything in between. A working paper by Convergence and the Business & Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Task Force tackles a subset of the question posed in its title, ‘Who is the private sector?’ The paper focuses on six types of institutional investors: pension funds; insurance companies; sovereign wealth funds; commercial and investment banks; private equity firms; and asset/wealth managers. The authors then consider how to mobilize capital from such institutional investors, through blended finance. Recommendations address: 1) engagement, 2) designing appropriate products and scaling successful solutions, 3) building off development finance institutions (DFIs) capabilities and experience, and 4) disseminating return and impact data.

Also from the Blended Finance Task Force, in partnership with the Business & Sustainable Development Commission and SYSTEMIQ, comes ‘Better Finance, Better World.’ This consultation paper says that institutional investors can leverage the current low-interest rate environment to use blended finance in a manner that de-risks investment in emerging markets infrastructure. The paper also notes the central role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and DFIs, but calls on both to increase their mobilization ratios. The paper highlights that MDBs currently mobilize less than US$1 of private capital per dollar invested. A write-up of the two papers on ImpactAlpha by Convergence’s Justice Durland looks at “ways to get the private sector to start paying attention” to the SDGs. Coverage of the second paper is also available on Public Finance International.

Eurodad’s Polly Meeks authored a piece, also on Public Finance International, asking whether blended finance is “a silver bullet or a double-edged sword” and noting the opportunity costs of blended finance. The article responds to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) ‘Private Finance for Sustainable Development’ conference, hosted on 29 January 2018, in Paris, France. The event, covered by Devex’s Molly Anders, launched an OECD report titled, ‘Making Blended Finance Work for the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The report notes blended finance’s potential for delivering the US$2.5 trillion annual investment needed to achieve the SDGs. It highlights that donor governments and other development actors are increasingly using blended finance, but acknowledges that “a critical first step” is simply agreeing on a common definition.

Lastly on blended finance, the Brookings Institution’s Emily Gustafsson-Wright asks, ‘Is paying for results with blended finance ready to take off?’ The post, featured on Brookings’ Education Plus Development blog, quotes Davos attendees’ remarks on the potential for innovative financing models, and evaluates the extent to which blended finance has been used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. Gustafsson-Wright looks at a range of case studies, including payment by results, social and development impact bonds, and other efforts by bilateral and multilateral donors. She concludes that there is indeed something to be said for blended finance, whose elements can enable more effective investment in prevention, incentivize collaboration, build a culture of monitoring and evaluation, and empower countries to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

The SDGs can serve as an investment tool for “putting value on values.”

Blended finance is not the only way for the private sector to support the SDGs. Thomson Reuters delves into other roles for private companies in article titled, ‘Can you use the SDGs as an investment tool?’ The post discusses opportunities to use environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics as a basis to develop investment strategies in manner that is consistent with, or centered around, the SDGs. The piece references a prior webinar and summary report on how the SDGs can serve as “a new tool for putting value on values.”

GreenBiz Group’s Anya Khalamayzer also looks at ESG opportunities aligned with the SDGs, through the lens of retirement and pension funds. The post highlights an aspirational goal by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to move US$10 billion in retirement assets under management of its member companies into ESG-themed retirement benefit accounts by 2020. Last week, together with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), WBCSD also launched draft guidance on applying Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ESG-related risks.

Private sector engagement with the SDGs featured broadly at GreenBiz 18, GreenBiz Group’s annual conference, which convened from 6-8 February 2018, in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions on Materiality and Metrics discussed three types of contributions to the 2030 Agenda: “the potential of business to realize the SDGs;” navigating the reporting landscape; and SDG achievement through improved soil health. A WBCSD-moderated GreenBiz tutorial highlights what businesses can do with respect to the SDGs, covering employment opportunities, technological innovation, and, as discussed above, finance.

Also on measuring business contributions, the SDG Compass has been updated with new indicators, according to the Global Reporting Initiative. SDG Compass is a joint product of GRI, WBCSD and UN Global Compact that provides guidance to companies on aligning strategies and measuring contributions to the SDGs.

A UBS white paper titled, ‘Partnerships for the Goals,’ explores opportunities for wealth managers to collaborate with MDBs, financial services firms, UBS’s clientele, and social enterprises, in order to mobilize the estimated US$5-7 trillion of annual investment needed to meet the SDGs. The paper calls on wealth managers to take action in five areas: 1) working more closely with MDBs, 2) standardizing sustainable and impact investing conventions, 3) working together to “fashion new solutions that fill gaps in the SDG-funding instrument landscape,” 4) focusing on outcomes and impacts, in partnership with philanthropic clients, and 5) working with social entrepreneurs and introducing them to their stakeholders.

An upcoming SDG Knowledge Weekly brief will explore the role of public finance in making the SDGs a reality, as the international community gears up for meetings on tax collaboration, infrastructure, and follow-up to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FFD.

The hotel industry and Japanese companies are among the business entities taking action recently.

Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) is advancing inclusive, sustainable economic growth through a partnership approach across governments, business and civil society. P4g has invited concept notes to join its Partnership Fund, which will be accepted through 30 March 2018. The P4G initiative aims to catalyze inclusive, sustainable economic growth through partnerships and solutions in support of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. P4G supports partnerships through funding, facilitation and recognition. P4G partners include the governments of Chile, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Viet Nam, the C40 network of 91 major cities, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Also working in alignment with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) established four ‘ITP Goals,’ addressing climate change, water, youth employment and human rights. The goals “embrace science-based targets” on carbon, and encourage the hotel industry to reduce carbon emissions at scale. According to the UN, the global hotel industry accounts for approximately one percent of global emissions, and this amount is predicted to increase as demand grows. ITP encourages the use of its Hotel Footprinting Tool for hotels to identify their carbon emissions and identify areas of improvement, including through energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.

On water, the ITP goals focus on addressing water scarcity and improving water-use efficiency. On youth employment, the ITP goals aim to double the industry’s impact on youth unemployment through employability programmes. On human rights, the ITP goals seek to raise awareness of human rights risks, address risks in the labor supply chain and hotel construction, and include human rights in corporate governance.

The Japanese company Omron considers the SDGs in developing medium-term business plans.

In Japan, companies have set targets in line with the SDGs and are working to advance sustainability across a number of the Global Goals. Companies that have set SDG targets include:

Ajinomoto, which works on infant nutrition in developing countries;

Fujitsu, which advances environmental technologies;

Lixil, which will increase the number of developing countries in which it manufactures portable toilets;

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

It notes that these projects have yielded valuable lessons on innovation to tackle inequities, and illustrate ways to overcome common challenges faced by eHealth programs, including with regard to gender inequality and women’s empowerment.

Titled ‘Overcoming eHealth challenges with social and technical innovations,’ the IDRC’s webpage that documents the projects focuses on outcomes and experiences linked to its Strengthening Equity through Applied Research Capacity building in eHealth (SEARCH) initiative. The initiative involved local research teams working closely with community members, health providers, and decision-makers at local and national levels, and explored whether and in which circumstances eHealth and mHealth could “respond to key challenges to deliver quality services to everyone.” In the context of this project, eHealth refers to the use of mobile phones and other digital technologies to improve the health and well-being of populations, while mHealth is used for tools with a strong mobile component.

In Bangladesh, IDRC reports on the development, by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), of a framework for integrating equity, accountability, and system integration considerations in the design, development, and evaluation of eHealth projects. Comprising 10 criteria on strategic vision, participation, transparency, responsiveness, equity, ethics, information governance, rule of law, performance, and sustainability, the framework is meant to ensure that government and eHealth implementers consider equity and accountability in project design.

In Burkina Faso, IDRC indicates that the MOS@N platform, developed locally using open source software, enables access to information about maternal and child healthcare, and living with HIV. Funded by IDRC and carried out in collaboration with the University of Montreal, the MOS@N project is a mobile phone communication system deployed in five health centres serving 26 villages in Burkina Faso. Text and interactive voice messaging systems issue messages in five local languages to ensure inclusiveness and greater accessibility. In addition, MOS@N can use solar recharging systems installed in health centres and provided to community health workers to counter erratic electricity supply.

In Kenya, the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, with the financial support from IDRC, carried out a mapping of the National eHealth Strategy first launched in 2011. The mapping’s findings are being used to: inform the review of the eHealth strategy; formulate the country’s first eHealth policy; and develop standards and guidelines. Guides to standardize hardware and software systems to ensure interoperability and set common standards for mHealth systems are also being prepared, IDRC notes. The 2011 National eHealth Strategy targeted areas including telemedicine, electronic health records, information for citizens, mHealth, and eLearning or distance education to boost health professionals’ knowledge.

In Peru, IDRC indicates that the Minister of Health signed, in January 2017, a ministerial order to implement an innovative eHealth system (WawaRed) throughout the country. Piloted in 15 health centres in the district of Ventanilla to improve maternal and child health, WawaRed should reach 350 centres countrywide, including 20 in the humid lowlands where the Zika virus continues to spread. IDRC states that researchers at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, with the Centre’s support, created an integrated data collection and analysis platform that links the country’s fragmented healthcare system, from local health centres to the central Ministry of Health. It adds that WawaRed is likely to expand to other areas of healthcare, including tuberculosis treatment and tracking HIV and other diseases.

Among other country experiences reported on the webpage, IDRC indicates that a community-based eHealth system (e-Sahha project) developed by the American University of Beirut and funded by IDRC is showing how non communicable diseases (NCDs) care can be effectively delivered to displaced and rural populations. The Centre notes that the eHealth system, tested in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health in rural areas and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Palestinian refugee camps, has increased diabetes and high blood pressure detection, reduced high blood pressure levels, and improved diabetes control. It also states that after one year, patients receiving text messages had improved their control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and many had changed their behaviors based on the messages they received.

IDRC supports research in developing countries to promote growth, reduce poverty, and “drive large-scale positive change.” The Centre is governed by a board of up to 14 governors, whose chairperson reports to Parliament through the Canadian Minister of International Development. Its head office is located in Ottawa, Canada, with four regional offices in Cairo (Egypt), Montevideo (Uruguay), Nairobi (Kenya) and New Delhi (India).

In a blog post, UNDP Indonesia shares nine characteristics that are key to its Country Platform’s potential success.

The UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 envisions the role of Country Support Platforms as helping countries design and deliver integrated SDG solutions, with variation among platforms according to the country context. The platforms respond to increased demand for collaboration among a wider range of actors.

UNDP Indonesia presents the SDGs as “the trillion-dollar investment opportunity that they are” rather than focusing on potential funding shortfalls. According to UNDP Indonesia, 79% of Indonesians donated money in the past month, making Indonesia the second most generous country in the world. Islamic law mandates that all Muslims who are eligible donate at least 2.5% of their income or accumulated wealth to the poor and needy, a practice known as Zakat. UNDP Indonesia calculated that, if every eligible Muslim pays US$74 annually, the country could generate US$16 billion, an amount that “represents a huge potential to support the SDGs.”

The nine key characteristics of Indonesia’s Country Platform are:

A collaborative space: The Platform involves the UN, the Government of Indonesia, private sector and civil society, both in Indonesia and globally, in developing solutions to achieve the SDGs;

Focus on partnerships: UNDP Indonesia has invited a wide range of actors to participate in the Platform, including to set the agenda, provide funding, second staff and become investment partners;

Pilot and scale innovation: The Platform has tested new solutions with the aim of replicating solutions within and across countries and advises large-scale investments on inclusivity and sustainability;

A networked Platform: The Platform is composed of a horizontal network of platforms that are linked with other countries to facilitate South-South cooperation;

Focus on SDG financing: The Platform is focused on designing financing instruments, informing investments and developing and advising partners on policy and knowledge sharing, an approach aimed at responding to demand and producing results;

Maximum innovation: The Platform has “one foot inside and one foot outside the government,” a position that allows the Platform freedom to innovate and leverage change;

Capacity-building: The Platform utilizes skills like Islamic finance and private investment, SDG impact measurement, systems thinking and design and technological solutions;

Sustainable: The Platform’s business model relies on a combination of grants and service fees, with the aim of increasing fees over time; and

Integrated: UNDP serves as an integrator in the Platform by facilitating a system-wide approach to the SDGs, bringing together partners and providing a space for innovation.

The partnership between BAZNAS, the state zakat agency, and UNDP Indonesia is the first time a Zakat organization has committed to supporting the SDGs. Zainulbahar Noor, BAZNAS, said that the agency’s conversations with UNDP helped BAZNAS to realize that “when you are talking about SDGs, you are talking about zakat.” Noor said UNDP and BAZNAS are collaborating on zakat inclusion, explaining that when the agency collects zakat through branchless banking, it can use the funds to support the SDGs.

Following a national consultation on the topic, the Ministry of Climate Change will launch a technical study on a possible carbon pricing instrument.

The national consultation took place in Islamabad, Pakistan, organized by Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change and the Collaborative Instruments for Ambitious Climate Action (CI-ACA) project, which the UNFCCC Secretariat runs through its five Regional Collaboration Centres. Approximately 60 public- and private-sector representatives agreed that carbon pricing is worth exploring as a way to reduce emissions and increase green investment. However, they cautioned that any carbon-pricing scenario must be compatible with Pakistan’s economic development objectives, poverty reduction, and increased access to sustainable energy, among other goals.

Participants agreed that Pakistan could draw on the experiences of other countries in developing and implementing carbon pricing instruments, such as a tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or an emissions cap-and-trade system. They emphasized the importance of transparency, clear institutional arrangements, awareness-raising, capacity building, and robust monitoring, and reporting and verification systems.

Approximately 42 national and 25 subnational jurisdictions are pricing carbon. The EU Emissions Trading System, currently the largest carbon market, covers about 1.75 billion tonnes of emissions.

Danish energy giant Ørsted's chief executive has highlighted the severe threats of climate change and the unique opportunities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the company's latest sustainability report, which outlined the company's transition away from fossil fuels.

Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy, released its first sustainability report since the name change, earlier this week. The report outlines that over the past decade, the Danish company had reduced its coal use by 82% - with a 100% reduction targeted for 2023 – while sourcing 64% of heat and power generation from renewables – with a target to source more than 95% in place for 2023.

As part of his speech to accompany the report, Ørsted’s chief executive Henrik Poulsen noted the need to transition to clean energy sources, a claim backed by the 23 offshore windfarms currently owned by the company.

""The world is in the middle of a global climate crisis. It is not a distant threat,” Poulsen said. “The planet is already feeling the grave impact of climate change. And truth be told, we are still not doing enough to secure the planet for generations to come. We need to transform the global energy systems from black to green energy at a high pace.

“Ørsted’s vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. It is deeply rooted in what we do and who we are as a company. We want to be a company that provides real, tangible solutions to one of the world’s most difficult and urgent problems.”

The company has a 2023 goal to reduce carbon emissions by 96% against a 2006 baseline and use 100% certified sustainable biomass for CHP plants by 2020. The latest report notes that Ørsted has reduced emissions by 67% since 2006, and currently sources 72% certified biomass.

For emissions, Ørsted noted that its science-based reduction target is not only in line with the Paris Agreement, but is actually 27 years ahead of the reduction trajectory for the sector.

The goals are all aligned to the United Nation’s SDGs, with an emphasis on goal 7 (clean and affordable energy) and goal 13 (climate action).

“At Ørsted, we are committed to running our business in a way that creates progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,” Poulsen added. “The 17 goals express a global agreement of society’s greatest challenges towards 2030. We especially focus on goal no. 7 on clean and affordable energy and goal no. 13 on climate action.”

Last year, Ørsted completely divested its upstream oil and gas business, as part of the pledge to phase-out coal from its heat and power generation by 2023. The company is also relaying this transition onto customers.

The firm announced that it will offer UK businesses the chance to purchase renewable electricity at a subsidised rate, by absorbing cost premiums to ensure that green energy prices are no higher than traditional ""brown energy"" sources.

Hornsea One

Ørsted’s sustainability report was published on the same week that the company began construction on the world's biggest wind farm; the Hornsea One project off the Yorkshire coast. By 2020, the 1.2GW project is expected to deliver enough electricity to power more than one million homes.

The project will also be followed by the bigger Hornsea Two wind farm. The 1.3GW wind farm was granted a final investment decision last September.

The study – entitled How to report on the SDGs: What good looks like and why it matters – reviews corporate reporting on the SDGs from the world’s largest 250 companies (G250) and assesses it against nine SDG reporting quality criteria.

KPMG’s research finds that within two years of the SDGs being launched in 2015, four in ten (40 percent) top companies acknowledged the global goals in their corporate reporting. Of these, 84 percent identified the SDGs they consider most relevant to their business.

However, less than one in ten has reported a business case for action on the SDGs (8 percent) or has set specific and measurable (SMART) business performance targets related to the global goals (only 10 percent).

Adrian King, a lead author of the study and KPMG’s Global Lead for Sustainability Reporting & Assurance, said:

“There are huge business opportunities inherent in tackling the world’s toughest problems, but so far only a handful of big companies have shown they understand that. These few leaders stand to benefit from recognizing the SDGs as a powerful catalyst for the innovation, partnerships and market transformations that build businesses. They will also be at an advantage when communicating with the many investors, governments and other stakeholders who are taking an increasing interest in the contribution of business to the SDGs.”

Key findings from KPMG’s study include:

The SDGs most commonly prioritized by leading companies are Climate Action (SDG13), Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG8) and Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG3)

The SDGs least commonly prioritized are Life on Land (SDG15), Zero Hunger (SDG2) and Life Below Water (SDG14)

Three quarters (75 percent) of companies that report on the SDGs discuss the impact their business has on the goals, but reporting is largely unbalanced with most companies discussing their positive impacts but not the negative

The study – entitled How to report on the SDGs: What good looks like and why it matters – reviews corporate reporting on the SDGs from the world’s largest 250 companies (G250) and assesses it against nine SDG reporting quality criteria.
KPMG’s research finds that within two years of the SDGs being launched in 2015, four in ten (40 percent) top companies acknowledged the global goals in their corporate reporting.
Of these, 84 percent identified the SDGs they consider most relevant to their business.

In emissions trading scheme (ETS) news, the US state of New Jersey is rejoining a regional greenhouse gas (GHG) initiative after six years, and Kazakhstan launched its reformed ETS.

In January 2018, Canada began the implementation of its national carbon pricing strategy, announced in 2016. The carbon pricing scheme is part of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which aims to reduce emissions and build climate resilience while ensuring economic growth. Canada has set a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Under the national scheme, Canada’s provinces and territories can choose their approach to carbon pricing using either an explicit price or a cap-and-trade scheme. In 2019, the Canadian government will implement a federal-level pricing backstop that will apply to provinces and territories that either request this or that do not have an adequate pricing system in place. A draft legislative proposal for this federal backstop will be made available for comment in early 2018. In a comment, environmental advocacy group Carbon Market Watch noted that the Canadian federal government must negotiate with ten provinces, suggesting that this means on the one hand that the new plan is likely to force provinces to do more to reduce emissions. On the other hand, the flexibility and autonomy allowed in implementation “could undermine its performance.” [Government of Canada Webpage on Carbon Pricing] [Carbon Market Watch Commentary]

In ETS news, the US state of New Jersey is on track to rejoin the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) of nine states after incoming state Governor Philip D. Murphy (Democrat), elected in November 2017, signed an executive order that initiates a rule making process for re-entry. New Jersey, a founding member of the RGGI, left the initiative in 2012 under Governor Chris Christie (Republican). The International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) reported that New Jersey’s power sector emissions increased by 15% between 2011 and 2015 while those in the other RGGI states decreased. [ICAP Story]

After two years in suspension, Kazakhstan relaunched its ETS on 1 January 2018. The revamped ETS includes new provisions and targets, including a three-year national allocation plan and an emissions cap of 5% below 1990 levels by 2020. The Kazakh ETS now comprises 225 installations and 130 companies in the energy and industrial sectors. To support the relaunched ETS, Kazakhstan has also developed, jointly with the World Bank, an electronic reporting system for GHG emissions from these sectors.

In an effort to safeguard the environmental integrity of The EU ETS ahead of the Brexit, the UK informed the EU Climate Change Committee that it adopted a law on 27 December 2017 that advances its compliance deadline for 2018 emissions to a date preceding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Consequently, and in line with an EU ETS Registry Regulation endorsed by the Climate Change Committee in November 2017, allowances issued by the UK during 2018 will not be marked or accepted for surrender.

As energy is a ‘nexus issue’ that spans the breadth of the SDGs, our attention was also drawn to knowledge products that directly link energy to decent jobs (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

The Global Preparatory Meeting for Review of SDG 7 took place from 21-23 February, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Thai Ministry of Energy. The meeting highlighted progress on energy access in the Asia-Pacific region, but also remaining challenges. In her opening remarks, ESCAP Executive Secretary Shamshad Akhtar noted that the region remains “the most energy intensive” in the world. The SDG Knowledge Hub summary of the meeting is here.

As an input to the assessment of SDG 7, a series of 27 policy briefs was developed by the Ad Hoc Informal Multi-stakeholder Technical Group of Advisors on SDG 7. Each brief features key messages and statistics on progress so far, as well as priority actions to accelerate movement towards the Goal. The briefs are categorized into four sections: 1) advancing SDG 7 implementation; 2) interlinkages between SDG 7 and other Goals; 3) regional perspectives; and 4) “toward a sustainable and equitable energy future.”

Under the first heading, the papers look at trends in achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix, financing SDG 7 and more. The brief on electricity access notes the difference between having a source of electricity and having universal access, cautioning that the former does not guarantee the latter. The brief on cooking fuels highlights that 40% of households (3 billion people) still prepare meals using “traditional” stoves, which poses a risk to both human health and the environment. It notes that upwards of 4.3 million deaths each year are attributable to household air pollution, and lists priority actions for policy, planning, finance and monitoring, such that clean cooking fuels can be realized for all. The brief on increasing the share renewables notes that 80% of total final energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, but that 60% could of electricity be generated by renewables by 2030. The finance brief highlights the importance of policy measures on both the demand-side (i.e. de-risking investment, carbon pricing) and supply-side (financial system reform). It also outlines the potential for financial technology (“fintech”) solutions to facilitate the development of small-scale, distributed energy systems.

A brief linking energy, climate and transport calls for prioritizing alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

Ten policy briefs highlight linkages between SDG 7 and other Goals. The brief linking energy to poverty and inequality highlights that “energy is a precondition for economic development,” meaning that achieving SDG 7 is not only a goal in itself, but also a means of achieving others. The water-energy-food nexus brief notes that policy coherence is key to managing tradeoffs and synergies, given increasing needs across all three areas. Connecting energy to health, Policy Brief #10 recalls the above statistic on clean cooking fuels, also describing how energy enables health services (i.e. through vaccine refrigeration and equipment sterilization) and offering examples of how SDG 7 contributes to targets under SDG 3. The briefs linking energy to climate and transport call for prioritizing reduced emissions and alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

The ‘Regional Perspective’ category dedicates papers to energy trends in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Arab region, as well as a brief covering Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The fourth category unpacks long-term and systemic issues, such as energy pathways to 2050 and the linkages between indicators, data and energy. The papers were developed in conjunction with stakeholders from the UN system, bilateral governments, multilateral actors and civil society.

During the meeting, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Southeast Asia.’ The report describes macroeconomic and social trends, analyzes the current energy landscape and recent investment and deployment trends, and outlines the benefits of decentralized renewable energy. It finds that, although 65 million people in the region currently lack reliable electricity access, there remains potential to tap significant renewable energy resources whilst adding jobs in the energy sector. The report makes a case for diversifying energy production through renewables, noting that there were over 611,000 renewable energy jobs in the region as of 2016. The report also highlights socio-economic, health and environmental benefits from decentralized renewable energy, offering a goal-level mapping to the SDGs starting on page 131.

As previewed in last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Region convened from 1-2 March in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum discussed Goal 7 among the other SDGs to be reviewed at the HLPF. Case studies of national experiences in implementing the Goals in ECE countries were provided by governments and other stakeholders for discussion at the meeting. They examine how energy systems are being made more efficient, what initiatives have enabled increased investment, and the policies and measures that have been implemented to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.” A session on ‘transforming energy in support of the 2030 Agenda’ explored the reconciliation of countries’ emissions targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change with their short-term reliance on fossil fuels.

Additional knowledge products were released outside of the meetings. A separate report by IRENA finds that, despite the EU’s current reliance on fossil fuels, member countries “could cost effectively double the share of renewable energy by 2030.” The finding, one of many from ‘Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union,’ comes as part of a broader, bottom-up REmap analysis that assesses and aggregates countries’ and regions’ renewable energy potential. REmap’s aim is to build a roadmap that looks not only on technologies for electricity, but also for heating, cooling and transportation

A joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) and Facebook looks at options for bridging the “digital divide,” noting that nearly 4 billion people lack internet access. Titled ‘Powering Last-Mile Connectivity,’ the paper frames the issues partly as one of a need for better infrastructure to increase efficiency. The paper cites that mobile network operators spend up to US$3.8 billion on fuel alone to power infrastructure, and that for consumers, charging mobile phones is both costly and time-consuming if charging points are far away, as is often the case in rural areas. The findings highlight the importance of the interlinkages across the SDGs, particularly the interface between SDG 7 and SDG 9,

The Center for Global Development released a policy paper titled, ‘What Can We Learn about Energy Access and Demand from Mobile-Phone Surveys? Nine Findings from Twelve African Countries.’ While not explicitly covering SDG 7, the paper offers insight as to both survey techniques and challenges facing universal access to energy services (SDG target 7.1).

At the city level, new analyses by CDP find that 102 cities worldwide now source at least 70% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Detailed coverage of the CDP report, and related energy news from the BP, Coal India, and the Government of Ireland, is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Consisting of 11 Heads of State and Government and one Special Adviser, the Panel focused on accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), as well as on the other SDGs that rely on the development and management of water resources, especially SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 3 (good health and well-being); SDG 15 (life on land); SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 1 (no poverty); and SDG 13 (climate action).

In April 2016, the UN Secretary-General and the World Bank President convened the HLPW to champion a comprehensive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources, as well as improving water and sanitation-related services. The Panel presented its outcome package, titled ‘Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action,’ to the UN Secretary-General on 14 March 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The package consists of an open letter to fellow leaders, an outcome document, short summaries of key initiatives undertaken by the Panel, and a galvanizing video.

Through the package, the HLPW advocates for evidence-based policies and innovative approaches at the global, national and local levels to make water management and water and sanitation services attractive for investment and more disaster-resilient. It also calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome package calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome document presents a summary of the Panel’s findings and recommendations. The text notes that action on SDG 6 is urgent, explaining that gaps in access to water supply and sanitation, growing populations, more water-intensive patterns of growth, increasing rainfall variability, and pollution are combining to make water one of the greatest risks to economic progress, poverty eradication, and sustainable development. The document underscores that if the world continues on its current path, it may face a 40% shortfall in water availability by 2030, with consequences that will be disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable. Within this scenario: approximately 700 million people are at risk of being displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030; more than two billion people are compelled to drink unsafe water; and more than 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services.

The Panel stresses the need to invest in data for water management and to strengthen water governance mechanisms. It further calls for: an integrated approach to water management; investing more efficiently in disaster risk reduction and in water-related infrastructure; building sustainable cities and human settlements; and strengthening global and international water cooperation. The HLPW also recommends encouraging innovation, promoting partnerships, and increasing finance and institutional support for water issues. Other recommendations include ensuring universal access to safe water and sanitation, and nurturing environmental water.

The Open Letter highlights that the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development,” will commence on 22 March 2018, and the Heads of State and Government on the Panel ask readers to join with them in “committing to valuing water and taking action to address our water challenge within this decade.” [Publication: Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action][HLPW Website][Open Letter to Global Leaders] [ UN Secretary-General Receives HLPW Outcome (Press release)] [HLPW video inspires the world to take action (Video) ]","14 March 2018: The High Level Panel on Water (HLPW) released its outcome package, concluding its mandate with a call for a fundamental shift in the way the world manages water.

The report shows that agencies have accomplished 61% of their aims since WWF-7 took place in the Republic of Korea, and are continuing their efforts. The report also offers 14 policy recommendations to the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (HLPF) for when it convenes in July 2018 to review progress on the SDGs, including SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation.

The publication titled, ‘Synthesis Report on Implementation Roadmaps 2015-2018’ covers 16 water-related issues that the global water community previously identified as priorities in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Implementation Commitment (DGIC), an outcome of WWF-7. ‘Implementation Roadmaps’ (IRs) are intended to provide a framework for WWF partners to act on their commitments. The IRs provide continuity between each Forum, promote collaboration among partners, and contribute to global water-related processes. Between WWF-7 and WWF-8, review meetings took place in the Republic of Korea in 2016 and 2017 to monitor progress on these commitments.

The IR themes for the past three-year period since WWF-7 relate to overarching concerns of water security; water for prosperity and development; water for sustainability; and implementation mechanisms. Many of the themes identified at WWF-7 in 2015 foreshadowed specific water-related targets under the SDGs: for example, on water quality, WWF-7 participants agreed to improve water quality by 2030 by reducing pollution, minimizing the release of hazardous agro-chemicals, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and increasing recycling and safe reuse. In comparison, SDG target 6.3 is very similar, but refers to “hazardous chemicals and materials” instead of agro-chemicals, and includes a commitment to eliminate dumping. The report provides an overview of progress on each of the 16 themes identified for action.

The report’s policy recommendations for the HLPF highlight water security as a prerequisite to the achievement of all the SDGs, not only SDG 6. The authors call for increased financing to be directed towards the overall goal of water security and for financial flows to be channeled to sub-national and local governments, where appropriate, to enable a holistic approach to water management at the city level, with co-benefits in land planning, solid waste management, energy, and transport. Other recommendations reflect, inter alia, concerns for promoting complementarity between sewered and non-sewered city sanitation services, and increasing the visibility of climate-related risks in policy dialogues.

In their respective forewords to the report, Korea Water Forum President Jung-Moo Lee and WWC President Benedito Braga affirmed the work of many international, national, regional and local agencies, referred to as DGIC Champions and Core Groups, for their policy leadership and efforts in advancing progress on the various water issues.

34,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/reports-launched-on-iwd2018-assess-progress-on-womens-land-rights/,"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Reports Launched on IWD2018 Assess Progress on Women’s Land Rights,"13 March 2018: The need to guarantee women’s access to and ownership of land, property and other economic assets are incorporated into several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including: SDG 5 (gender equality) target 7; SDG 1 (no poverty) target 3; and SDG 2 (zero hunger) target 3. Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

A recent audit of land ownership by the Kenya Land Alliance that was guided by gender parity objectives set out in Kenya’s constitution, the SDGs and various African Union (AU) targets, including the AU Declaration of Land Issues and Challenges in Africa and related target of achieving 30% of documented land rights for women by 2025, found that despite the adoption of Kenya’s progressive new constitution in 2010, women’s land ownership lags far behind that of men. The audit analyzed about one-third of the 3.2 million title deeds issued since 2013 and found that women hold roughly 10% of land titles issued in the last five years. An even greater gender disparity was found in terms of actual land size, with women getting only 1.62% of more than 10 million hectares of land titled during this period.

Discussing the need to build the evidence base on how best to strengthen women’s land rights in Africa and globally, a post on the World Bank’s Voices blog makes a case for more “nuanced data collection.” The blog references a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), titled, ‘Women’s land rights as a pathway to poverty reduction: A framework and review of available evidence,’ which argues that despite the large body of literature on the relationship between land tenure security, livelihoods, and poverty, most of this literature is based on household-level data and does not consider possible intra-household inequalities in land ownership. It mentions ongoing efforts at the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) to develop standard methods for measuring perceived tenure security, for example on the differing perceptions of women and men about their risk of land confiscation, or the experiences of women within male-headed households. Among some examples of possible policy measures that build on a more “nuanced” approach to land data, the blog highlights efforts to incentivize joint registration of land held by married couples in Uganda, and a project in Benin to demarcate village boundaries and certify farm plots.

Another UN-HABITAT report published on the Land Portal titled, ‘Women and Land in the Muslim World: Pathways to increase access to land for the realization of development, peace and human rights,’ notes that while women around the world face similar challenges – including socially prescribed gender roles, unequal power dynamics, discriminatory family practices, and unequal access to justice – the influence of customary and religious practices in countries with a dominant Muslim population create “context-specific opportunities to meet these challenges.” Among some tenure options in these contexts, the report pays special attention to the protection of women’s land rights through inheritance and at the time of marriage, when the land and property regime of the family is redefined. Legal and administrative reforms, access to justice, credit and microfinance are presented as important conditions for change, with emphasis on the protection of displaced women’s land and housing rights.

One example of how programmes are working in an innovative way in a Muslim setting is the use of community radio to raise women’s awareness of their land and property rights in the predominantly Somali-speaking Garissa County of northern Kenya. An article published on the Land Portal narrates an exchange among women members of a radio listening club following the airing of a specially-packaged radio programme, which includes drama series, radio features, call-in sessions and a segment explaining relevant clauses within the Kenyan constitution.

Some listeners recount how they lost everything after undergoing divorce, while others highlight the struggles they have gone through to get ownership of their land, livestock and property, and the abuse they have received as a result. The article notes that as a result of the awareness created, mass applications received by the Garissa land registry office from women wanting to transfer land into their names. The overall impact on women’s economic empowerment is further highlighted by the success of the Sankuri Women Milk Hawking Cooperative Society, which was established in 2011 by activists, divorcees, widows and other village women who had faced cultural injustices. The article highlights the change in women’s social status, with one woman joking that men now inquire if women are divorced “so that they can marry us and be part of our prosperity.” [Kenya Land Alliance Website] [World Bank Voices Blog Post on Women’s Land Rights] [Publication: Women’s Land Rights as a Pathway to Poverty Reduction: A Framework and Review of Available Evidence] [Publication: Women and Land in the Muslim World] [Land Portal Story on “Land Rights FM”] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on International Women’s Day 2018]","Despite these ambitions, various reports that were launched close to International Women’s Day 2018 highlight slow progress towards achieving gender parity in land ownership and control.

Ranging from eradicating poverty to ensuring clean energy for all and reaching sustainable levels of consumption, 169 targets across these Goals were selected to drive efforts in the 15 years leading to 2030.

The SDGs build on the previous set of development targets—the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—which were adopted for the period 2000-2015. Unlike the MDGs, which were predominantly geared towards progress in so-called developing countries, the SDGs were designed to be globally inclusive. The breadth of the 17 Goals, their 169 targets and 230 indicators mean all countries face a significant challenge (domestically, as well as internationally) in delivering these commitments. This inclusiveness was also intended to extend beyond national-level contributions; the scope of the SDGs means that everyone has a role to play. This extends from policymakers to researchers, teachers, businesses and the general public.

As reported by the OECD, only one in ten Europeans knows of the SDGs, and across a sample of 24 countries, only one in 100 knows them well. If inclusivity and societal contribution are fundamental to the Goals, then we are already falling behind.

Engagement with the SDGs requires us to tell stories; we need interactive and engaging data.

Engagement with the SDGs and their potential requires us to tell stories: the narratives of lives across the world as they are now, and what we aspire for them to be. Beyond that, we need to understand how everyone’s stories weave together to provide a landscape of living conditions across the world. To explore where we are now, and how far we have to go by 2030, we need interactive and engaging data. Metrics must be specific to the SDG indicators, but presented in such a way that everyone can engage.

As an integrated project of Our World in Data, we therefore built an initial prototype of our SDG-Tracker—the first project to track the latest data across all of the 17 SDGs in a user-friendly way. It provides an interactive hub where users can explore and track progress across all of the SDG indicators for which there is data available.

The SDG-Tracker seemed like a crucial and somewhat obvious project to launch. We were therefore surprised to find that no one—including the large institutions heading global efforts such as the UN and World Bank—had done so. There are many resources where users can either download data for specific indicators or explore data for specific goals or targets (for example, FAO, UNESCO, IHME, WHO JMP and IEA), but none that brings together data across all of the 17 Goals in a user-friendly, interactive format. Delivering this functionality was the primary aim of our SDG-Tracker.

At SDG-Tracker.org, users can explore progress on all of the SDG indicators for which data is available (some of the official indicators do not have data available, and highlighting these important gaps is another project we wish to work on) at the global, regional and country levels. Where global maps are provided, clicking on a given country will show you a time-series of how a given metric (for example, childhood stunting) has changed over time. You can also add countries to this chart to compare progress across neighbors, regions and worldwide.

All of the data we use at our tracker is sourced from official, high-quality sources including the UN, World Bank, World Health Organization, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, WHO JMP, UNESCO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), among others. All of our metrics are updated from these sources in real-time; as soon as the latest data is available for a given indicator, it automatically updates on our interface (data releases tend to be on an annual basis). We therefore expect to always have up-to-date resource available to track our progress through to 2030.

All of our data is downloadable, and maps and charts are open-access; everyone is free to use and adapt these resources as they wish. We hope they provide a valuable resource that supports the UN, and the work of the many organizations, researchers, teachers and learners working towards the SDGs. We have already heard from many teachers and organizations who are making use of this new tracker.

Across each of the 17 Goals, we also link back to specific entries or resources at the Our World in Data (OWID) website, where you can find more information and longer-term data on all aspects of development.

To inspire participation and concerted effort towards the SDGs, it is essential that people understand how the world stands today and the progress we must make to achieve our targets. Without accessible data, it is impossible to assess progress towards the SDGs. But the SDG-Tracker, with its interactive and engaging presentation of data, provides a tool to help us achieve this global participation and inclusivity.","In 2015 the world set a new sustainable development agenda, with the heads of all UN Member States pledging to achieve 17 goals by 2030: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The SDGs build on the previous set of development targets—the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—which were adopted for the period 2000-2015.
Unlike the MDGs, which were predominantly geared towards progress in so-called developing countries, the SDGs were designed to be globally inclusive.
The breadth of the 17 Goals, their 169 targets and 230 indicators mean all countries face a significant challenge (domestically, as well as internationally) in delivering these commitments.
But the SDG-Tracker, with its interactive and engaging presentation of data, provides a tool to help us achieve this global participation and inclusivity."

Recently announced resources approach transparency and accountability through the lenses of corruption, gender equality, agriculture, and financing for sustainable development. This brief also reviews recent releases on the monitoring and review process for the SDGs.

The SDGs acknowledge that corruption can be a hindrance to sustainable development, with target 16.5 calling for the substantial reduction of the practice, as well as bribery in all forms. Transparency International’s Marie Chene writes on Medium that civil society actors and activists can monitor corruption using alternative indicators and data sources, which also chart corruption’s impacts on SDG achievement. She also highlights the role of civil society actors in increasing accountability through peer reviews of countries’ Voluntary National Review (VNR) reports, which are submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and conducting parallel reviews and shadow reports that complement—and potentially challenge—countries’ official VNRs.

Transparency International released one such country-level “shadow report” for Afghanistan. The report titled, ‘Policy, SDGs and Fighting Corruption for the People: A civil society report on Afghanistan’s Sustainable Development Goals,’ builds on a series of analyses conducted in 2017, which uses a common methodology to examine country progress towards SDG 16. Looking particularly at SDG targets 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows), 16.5 (substantially reduce corruption and bribery) and 16.10 (ensure public access to information), the report outlines how corruption negatively impacts on development through poor service provision and insecurity. It highlights Afghanistan’s progress on these thress targets, such as anti-money laundering efforts and the establishment of institutions to protect against corruption, but flags that, in practice, there is an implementation gap and low inclusion of civil society in anti-corruption legislation. A Transparency International press release is available.

Also on target 16.4, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) announced a new initiative to measure illicit financial flows in Africa during the 49th session of the UN Statistical Commission, which was held from 6-9 March on the theme, ‘Better Data, Better Lives.’ The SDG Knowledge Hub’s story on that session’s discussion of the SDG indicators is here.

Turning to gender and accountability, as covered on the SDG Knowledge Hub, the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation, in partnership with Women Deliver and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), launched the ‘Practice Guide to Auditing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Gender Equality’ on the sidelines of the 62nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 62), which is currently convening in New York. The guide reviews international commitments to gender equality and supports supreme audit institutions (SAIs) by developing an approach to ensure accountability and institutions’ meeting their commitments.

In the boardroom, BlackRock recently sent letters to 367 companies that have fewer than two female board members, asking these companies to justify the gender imbalance, Bloomberg has reported.

At the regional level and on agriculture-related SDGs, a research article in Sustainability informs the development of a “composite baseline index of the agriculture-related SDGs in Southern Africa to guide progress reporting.” The paper summarizes agriculture’s presence across the SDG framework, and uses data for eight indicators under five SDGs (1, 2, 6, 7 and 15) to develop the index for 13 southern African countries for which data on all indicators were available. The authors note that, in the face of data limitations and constraints, the results may be used to ensure accountability in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as a range of national investments and commitments prioritize agricultural developments. Further, the index can be used to track progress towards implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

On monitoring and accountability in the context of the broader 2030 Agenda, the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC) published the collaborative report titled, ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the Voluntary National Review Reports Submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017.’ The report aims to strengthen accountability by highlighting best practices in reporting, as well as gaps (notably around data). Highlights of the paper’s launch event and a detailed summary of the report by contributing author Nathalie Risse are available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A baseline of Australia’s SDG progress has been developed, with a dashboard to track 72 targets and 133 indicators.

The above knowledge products all point to the importance of transparency and data availability. These two pillars have been the focus of Australia’s approach to SDG implementation, as highlighted by Lisa Cornish on Devex. The 2018 Australian SDGs Summit was convened on 13 March 2018, in Melbourne. Previewed during the event, a baseline assessment of Australia’s progress towards the SDGs uses four methods to create a dashboard examining trends for 72 targets and 133 indicators. The document is being developed by the National Sustainable Development Council with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). With robust data and publicized findings, interested stakeholders can track the status of their priority goals, and become increasingly empowered to hold their governments accountable when progress is lacking.

On finance and accountability, Eurodad’s María José Romero writes on UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Hub that public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be less favored than standard public procurement processes if there is increased transparency about their costs. Although PPPs increasingly are used to finance development projects and can enable cross-sector collaboration, the cost of “capital, profit expectations by the private partners and transaction costs associated with the negotiation of complex PPP contracts” can detract from cost efficacy. The blog suggests that PPPs’ accounting practices can create a false narrative in governments’ balance sheets, and calls for increased transparency around PPPs and the disclosure of their long-term fiscal implications.

The Responsible Tax Principles were developed in collaboration with leading companies, civil society organizations, institutional investors and international institutions.

The B Team is a global nonprofit initiative co-founded by Sir Richard Branson, Derek Handley and Jochen Zeitz. It brings together a group of global leaders from business, civil society and government to “catalyze a better way of doing business that prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet.” The Principles delineated in the report titled, ‘A New Bar for Responsible Tax,’ offer a framework of good tax practice, including in the areas of tax management strategy, interactions with authorities, and reporting. The Principles have been endorsed by businesses including Allianz, BHP, A.P. Moller – Maersk, Natura Cosméticos, Repsol, Safaricom, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Unilever and Vodafone Group Plc.

The seven Principles proposed by The B Team are:

Make boards accountable for tax policy; Comply with the tax legislation of the countries in which you operate and pay the right amount of tax at the right time, in the countries where you create value; Be transparent about the entities you own around the world and why; Develop cooperative relationships with tax authorities, based on mutual respect, transparency and trust, including by not bribing or inducing tax officials, government officials or ministers with the aim of obtaining more beneficial outcomes with respect to tax matters; Seek and accept tax incentives only where they are aligned with real business, and in the manner intended, and give governments data on impact “where appropriate”; Engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation and administration; and Provide regular information to stakeholders, including investors, policy makers, employees, civil society and the general public, about your approach to tax and taxes paid.

Welcoming the launch of the Principles, Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International, said they have “raised the bar” on what constitutes responsible corporate tax behavior by setting a new standard for companies that claim to operate ethically. She invited all companies to meet these standards, adding that “truly forward-looking” companies should do even more.

Alex Cobham of Tax Network Justice, however, writes that the Principles “lack any hard criteria against which to evaluate progress.” Given the range of existing standards and proposals that do have such criteria, he writes that this makes the “new bar” proposed by The Responsible Tax Principles a lower bar. For example, on Principle 2, Cobham notes that the agreed G20/ OECD position of aligning declared profits with “real economic activity” rather than with “value creation” represents a clearer equivalent and it is thus stronger. On Principle 7, he suggests that other sets of principles, such as the OECD standard, allows for the comparisons needed to judge progress.

The B Team tax principles were launched ahead of the first global conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which took place on the theme ‘Taxation and the SDGs,’ from 14-16 February 2018. The Platform is a joint initiative by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD, UN and the World Bank Group, and it is designed to foster cooperation and build consensus around responsible tax practice.

38,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/businesses-commit-to-promote-gender-equality-in-workplace/,"Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Businesses Commit to Promote Gender Equality in Workplace,"28 February 2018: Participants at the Fourth Global Forum on Business for Gender Equality committed to promote gender equality in the workplace, including as a strategy to achieve the SDGs. The Forum outlined its commitment to eliminate gender gaps in the workplace in the ‘Call to Action of Chile.’

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Chile organized the Forum in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women. The event, which convened in Santiago, Chile, from 27-28 February 2018, focused on the theme ‘The Future of Work and the 2030 Agenda.’ Over 500 representatives from 39 countries, including more than 50 employers’ organizations and trade unions, attended the event.

The Forum addressed gender gaps in the workplace within the context of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). SDG 5 includes target 5.1, to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, and target 5.5, to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making. SDG target 8.5 aims to, by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value.

Participants shared progress and challenges related to achieving these SDG targets. The Gambia’s Vice President and Minister of Women’s Affairs, Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, reported that empowering women and enabling equal opportunities in the workforce is “a key pillar of our National Development Plan.” Jallow-Tambajang emphasized that businesses, from micro-credit and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, are taking steps to reduce inequalities, boost productivity and improve the Gambia’s economies.

Achieving equality in the labor force will require addressing women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work.

Richard Barathe, UNDP, observed that women’s equality in the labor force could contribute US$28 trillion to the global economy by 2025. But, he noted, this will require efforts to address women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, encourage women’s entry into the workforce and close the gender pay gap.

In the Call to Action of Chile, governments, the private sector and union members commit to “work every day” to promote equality and inclusion and to change working conditions to achieve greater equality between women and men. The signatories call on stakeholders to find innovative ways to apply lessons learned and to share the Forum’s messages on gender equity in their workplace and with other companies.

The Forum also discussed UNDP’s ‘Gender Equality Seal’ programme, which certifies companies that have eliminated pay gaps, increased the number of women in decision-making roles and made progress in ending sexual harassment in the workplace. UNDP supports partners in 17 countries around the world to meet gender equality targets.

The Forum’s website features a catalogue of solutions to accelerate gender equality. Solutions are organized around solutions to: eliminate the gender pay gap; promote labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors; build transformative partnerships; eradicate sexual harassment; promote women in business; foster women in leadership; and promote work-life balance.

On promoting labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors, UNDP describes a project that promoted the integration of women and girls in workplaces in Haryana, India, including a training program for women in the stainless steel sector. As a result, jobs opened in a sector that has not traditionally been an option for women in India. UNDP stresses that programmes focused on women “need not use a welfare approach” but can instead use a gender and development lens to focus on sustainable impact.

Indeed, our review of the most-read stories on the SDG Knowledge Hub in 2017 revealed that readers are eager for assessments and measurements of SDG implementation.

The SDG framework, as adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, includes 17 headline Goals and 169 targets to be implemented by 2030. A key component for this agenda is the use of a set of indicators in order to measure global progress on the Goals and targets. While the Goals and targets were adopted in 2015, the indicators for the SDG framework were adopted in 2017, following the selection of over 200 indicators in a process overseen by the UN Statistical Commission.

But even with the valuable tool that the global indicator framework provides, monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda, which is to be implemented universally and in a way that ensures that no one is left behind, remains a daunting task. For several indicators, for example, assessment methods still must be defined. In addition, all countries must determine the indicators for which they currently track data, and where they need to concentrate resources on developing new data sets.

As international organizations, governments and practitioners around the world focus their work plans and strategies on the 2030 Agenda, data are being collected, reported on and organized in visualizations that can begin to tell the story of where we stand vis-à-vis our 2030 ambitions. This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation. As our readers’ preferences indicate, the data-driven approach is viewed as an essential component for keeping us accountable and on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and identifying the available data to conduct this tracking is an important step in this process.

Global Assessments

The centerpiece for global assessments is the annual report that the UN Secretary-General is mandated to produce. In 2017, the most-read SDG Knowledge Hub news story was a summary of this global assessment – the UN Secretary-General’s ‘Progress Report towards the SDGs.’ This report was released in June, prior to the meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2017), and provided a global overview of the situation with regard to the Goals. The report was released shortly after the indicator set was recommended for adoption and used existing data compiled by the UN. As indicator development and data collection improve over the coming years, this annual report will be well placed to provide the official, overall assessment of progress.

In addition to this annual document, the UN Statistics Division released an ‘SDGs Report’ during the Ministerial segments of the HLPF in 2016 and 2017, reviewing progress towards the 17 Goals and based on the latest available data (first SDGs Report and second SDGs Report). The data from the 2017 SDGs Report were presented as inputs during the HLPF’s discussions on specific indicators.

Apart from these two reports from the UN Secretariat, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung have used internationally comparable data to produce the SDG Index and the SDG Dashboards, which were released in 2016 and 2017. They plan to release a related overview of implementation in 2018. This contribution to the assessment of progress has ranked countries according to their performance on the SDGs, in an effort to spur a conversation about leadership on specific Goals and where greater effort is most needed.

The custodians of individual indicators are also providing global assessment data for the specific indicator(s) they have been tasked with overseeing, and many of these organizations have created portals for the SDG-relevant data they maintain. Earlier this month, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) launched an online platform for reporting on the status and trends of the world’s forest resources, for example. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) has created an online tool that will capture data on achieving the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The World Bank’s dashboards present data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) that help to monitor the SDGs, and provide visualizations that permit comparisons among countries.

Efforts to bring together information on all of the indicators for a single Goal are also underway. In preparation for the July 2018 HLPF’s assessment of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), UN-Water has coordinated the development of the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation.’ This report is being prepared by the custodian agencies for the SDG 6 indicators, and will include baseline data and updates on data availability for each of the SDG 6 indicators. The preparation of this report was discussed at the 27th and 28th meetings of UN-Water.

Civil society organizations have also set up data portals. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative runs the Target 12.6 Live Tracker, which shows progress on sustainability reporting around the world.

In the midst of this growing number of portals and reports on specific indicators, targets and Goals, the SDG-Tracker project, which was launched in March 2018, brings together the data from many of the portals noted above, in addition to other sources. This project extracts the data from sources including the UN, World Bank, World Health Organization and FAO, and is updated as its sources release new data.

National Indicator Tracking

National governments are the keepers of official statistics for their country, and seek to ensure that indicator methodologies and data collection processes will result in robust, reliable datasets. The custodian agencies for the SDG indicators rely on the official statistics of each country to develop their data sets. A number of countries have developed monitoring and reporting mechanisms to report on their relevant official statistics, and identify indicators for which they do not currently collect data.

For example, the US recently updated the platform that it launched in 2017. This platform reports data for 82 indicators, with measures being improved for an additional 84 indicators, and data being explored for another 80 indicators. This site was built as an open source tool, and the US reports that it is collaborating with the UK and Ghana on national reporting platforms. Australia has just released the ‘SDG Baseline for Australia,’ as it prepares its first Voluntary National Review for the 2018 HLPF.

At the end of 2017, the European Union released a report titled, ‘Sustainable Development in the European Union: Monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context,’ which is based on a set of 100 indicators developed by the EU for this process. In mid-2017, the Government of Sri Lanka launched a report and website for reporting on the status of its SDG indicators at the national level. The publication identified 46 SDG indicators for which data is already available, and 29 indicators for which data could be compiled.

In January, DESA hosted a meeting on national platforms, where officials from national statistical systems and experts discussed how standardized national-level repositories could make global assessments more consistent.

Community Indicator Systems

Data collection at the local level is particularly important for this global agenda that seeks to “leave no one behind.” In many ways, local communities are the best placed to identify what should be counted and what is not currently being counted. The process of collecting this data can also prove to be an important project in itself, with local participation serving to educate and engage the community in the stories that the data can tell.

Community indicator systems offer a way for actors to track well-being at the local level. These efforts can also support the global assessment efforts by helping to make differentiated data available, to achieve the 2030 Agenda’s objective of leaving no one behind. During a recent webinar on localizing the SDGs in the North American context, sub-national efforts in British Columbia, Hawai’i, Winnipeg and Baltimore were revealed to all involve the use of community-level dashboards as one way to engage actors in sustainable development implementation.

Data Processing on the Road to 2030

As with SDG implementation itself, each of these levels of assessment feeds into and draws from the others. Global assessments offer an overall snapshot of where the international community is collectively moving. National governments can see how their contributions fit into the global picture, and consider where they can demonstrate leadership, or are falling short, compared to their peers. Local indicator systems can be tailored to specific challenges and opportunities in specific communities, drawing on and contributing to national level data.

Each iteration of this implied conversation contributes to the continuous learning that is required to implement the 2030 Agenda, as interlinkages among the targets are leveraged and success and failures are identified, and then incorporated into further action. And these data sources and lessons learned do not yet consider what big data sources might be able to add to this conversation.

For our part, we will continue to report on the new platforms and monitoring and evaluation projects that are being developed, as we help our readers answer whether we are “there” yet on the road towards 2030.","This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation.

A group of major retailers, including Ikea, Debenhams and Sainsbury's, have signed up to a series of commitments to collaboratively tackle pressing societal issues by using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework.

More than 25 UK retailers have committed to the Better Retail Better World pledge, which aims to boost corporate alignment to SDGs covering decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, sustainable communities, responsible consumption and production and climate action.

As part of the collaborative group, retails such as Boots, John Lewis, Kingfisher and Marks & Spencer have all agreed to share knowledge and best practice in addressing the goals. Launched by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the initiative will provide public updates on corporate progress against the SDGs.

Speaking at the launch of the initiative in Westminster this morning, BRC’s chairman Richard Pennycook said: “The penny has dropped, we realise we can do much more collectively than we can by competing on this particular ground…we’re launching something where the sector has held hands and said, ‘we can do this better together’.

“This is part of a growing movement for change. It is time for the retail industry to show what it can do for the common good. We are taking collective action to build a better, more prosperous and sustainable world, and demonstrating how we are making a positive contribution to society, in terms of the supply chain, food packaging, and waste.”

Race to restore

The UK retail sector employs around 3.2 million people and the BRC will work with retailers to address human rights issues, with tangible progress to be demonstrated by 2022. Signatories have pledged to reduce waste sent to landfill, measure all operational water use and progress responsible sourcing practices. Companies will also collaborate to eliminate links to deforestation by 2030 and reduce emissions and increase uptake of renewable energy.

Other retailers signing up to the Better Retail Better World pledge include Aldi, Baukjen Group, C&J Clarks, The Co-op, DFS, Dixons Carphone, Fenwicks, Greggs, The House of Bruar, House of Fraser, Lidl, Morrisons, Musgrave Group, Next, Ocado, Signet (Ernest Jones, H. Samuel), WHSmith and Wilko.

Commenting on the launch, WWF’s chief executive Tanya Steele said: “We are delighted to support the Better Retail Better World industry goals which provide BRC members with some of the best information and guidance to engage with the Sustainable Development Goals.

“The goals are what the SDGs are all about: bringing business, civil society and government together to bring about change in the world. Retail businesses working with consumers are key to the success of the SDGs and key in the race to restore nature.”

A collaborative commitment to the SDGs is welcome. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)’s Reporting Matters initiative notes that 79% of Council members currently mention the SDGs in reports, but only 6% have highlighted tangible action against a target. Mentioning the SDGs is itself at danger of becoming a new tick-box activity, according to the WBCSD.

Speaking exclusively to edie, the BRC’s head of environment and project lead, Alice Ellison, explained that the members would focus on five goals where retailers could make the most impact, by shaping new commitments around the targets listed under relevant goals.

“We’ve used the SDGs as a framework to shape what retail should be doing rather than using the SDGs to highlight what we’ve been doing,” Ellison said. “We’re at the beginning of the journey and we want as many retailers on board, so we might stick with the same targets, or they might evolve over time.

“Our members have signed a commitment and although businesses will do their own thing on the SDGs, we realise that a collaborative approach is where you can make a real difference. There’s still a lack of government direction, and because there are so many targets in the goals, it can be difficult to focus. Most of the members have already mapped their actions.”

The state of retail

Britain's retail sector is in a state of tremendous change. The perfect storm of cost pressures, rising inflation and slowing wage growth has led to fluctuations in consumer confidence, while a series of unexpected political events – topped by Brexit – has instilled a feeling of uncertainty across the high street.

41,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wmo-checklist-helps-enhance-early-warning-systems/,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WMO Checklist Helps Enhance Early Warning Systems,"23 March 2018: Early warning, a critical component of disaster risk reduction (DRR), can prevent loss of life and reduce the economic impacts of hazardous events, including disasters, according to a multi-hazard early warning systems checklist developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in partnership with the UN Office for DRR (UNISDR), UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and others.

Over the last thirty years, the number of lives lost from severe weather events has decreased largely because of increased accuracy of weather forecasting and warnings, and improved coordination with disaster management authorities.

Issued on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2018, the report titled, ‘Multi-hazard Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ focuses on the need for community engagement and education, disaster preparedness and effective dissemination of warnings, all required for effective early warning. It incorporates the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems, disaster risk information and enhanced risk assessments.

Early warning is reflected in the SDGs, particularly those related to food security, healthy lives, resilient cities, environmental management and climate change adaptation.

The checklist provides a list of actions that national governments, community organizations and partners can refer to when developing or evaluating early warning systems based on four main elements: disaster risk knowledge; detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards and possible consequences; warning dissemination and communication; and preparedness and response capabilities. The document will be updated based on the development of technologies, advances in multi-hazard early warning systems and feedback from the users.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRR Mami Mizutori urged countries to incorporate the checklist into national and local DRR strategies, which are scheduled to be in place by 2020 in accordance with target (e) of the Sendai Framework for DRR (substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2020). She said that a multi-hazard approach to early warnings is critical for building disaster resilience. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said WMO is working to establish a global standardized multi-hazard alert system in collaboration with National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS).

Early warning is an important component of a number of international agreements. The Sendai Framework for DRR recognizes the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems. The SDGs address early warning, particularly those related to food security (SDG 2), healthy lives (SDG 3), resilient cities (SDG 11) and climate change adaptation (SDG 13). The Paris Agreement on climate change also mentions early warning systems as a focus area to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, reduce vulnerability, and minimize loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.

An outcome of the first Multi-hazard Early Warning Conference that took place in May 2017 in Cancún, Mexico, the checklist updates the original document, ‘Developing Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ which emanated from the Third International Conference on Early Warning in March 2006.

The report, global in its focus, underscores the importance of such assessments in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity.

‘Assessing Environmental Impacts: A Global Review of Legislation’ finds a wide range of EIA legal requirements, globally. Some countries have strengthened their regulatory frameworks, but other countries have exhibited a trend of weakening the EIA process. On public participation, the report observes significant global variation in the role of public participation in EIAs. In some countries, requirements for public participation for EIAs have been expanded, particularly during the scoping and review stage. A few countries include specific provisions related to indigenous peoples’ participation in national EIA legislation.

On SEAs, the report observes that uptake and implementation of SEA legal requirements has been slow in many countries, and limited guidance exists on public participation and SEAs, including access to information. The report suggests that one reason for this trend may be that SEA legal approaches do not take into account strategic planning processes. According to the report, at least 40 countries have SEA systems in place, but only some of these countries have formal legal requirements to conduct SEAs.

Other report findings include: a need to improve measurement of ecosystem services, including addressing challenges related to a lack of available, accessible and fit-for-purpose data; and an increased focus on climate change and human health in EIA and SEA legislation. The report recommends application of a “migration hierarchy,” a sequence of actions to anticipate and avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as good practice.

The report features country examples of EIA and SEA arrangements. The examples focus on six steps in the process: screening; scoping and impact analysis; review of the EIA/SEA report; decision-making; follow-up and adaptive management; and public participation. For each step, the report shares examples from countries around the world.

The 3rd Pacific Regional NDC Dialogue fleshed out the elements of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub, and provided an opportunity for Pacific island States to discuss NDC-related experiences and needs.

The NDC dialogue and consultations on the NDC Hub took place in Suva, Fiji, from 12-14 March 2018. During the meeting, countries exchanged experiences in NDC implementation, including implementing energy projects, reviewing and revising legislation to create a more enabling environment for NDC implementation, and establishing green energy funds. Participants elaborated on links between the NDCs and their national development plans, national energy plans and strategies, and SDG implementation.

Participants urged mainstreaming NDC implementation into national sectoral and budget processes, and identified challenges and barriers related to, inter alia, financing, capacity, and skills and data gaps. Many countries stated their desire to: enhance their NDCs by adding sectors such as transport, forestry and agriculture; strengthen the adaptation element in their NDCs; and communicate their ambitions through the Talanoa Dialogue. They also discussed opportunities for enhancing the gender responsiveness of NDCs and using NDC implementation to advance gender equality.

On identifying opportunities to translate NDCs into actionable projects, particularly in the energy sector, and linkages with sectoral planning, countries highlighted establishing energy committees, and developing projects in solar energy, biomass and hydropower. Participants underscored linkages between the NDCs and sectoral energy planning documents. Many emphasized that they are using existing sectoral energy strategies as NDC implementation plans.

On finance, participants stressed the need to develop financing strategies to support NDC implementation, including the development of investment plans, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the creation of enabling environments for private sector investment.

Participants agreed on the details of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub in terms of services provided, as well as the funding mechanism, structure and governance, and finalized the draft design document based on national priorities and needs. They agreed that the Hub should provide assistance on enhancement, review and inclusion of adaptation, and guidance on synergies between mitigation and resilience.

The Regional Pacific NDC Hub is an arm of the NDC Partnership, which aims to enhance cooperation and countries’ access to the necessary technical knowledge and financial support for NDC implementation.

On new ideas for services to be provided by the Hub, they proposed, inter alia, NDC roadmaps beyond 2030, knowledge management platforms, support for national reporting, expansion of NDCs to new sectors, desegregating sectoral targets, and knowledge sharing with other regions.

On delivery mechanisms, participants suggested, inter alia, online NDC training, and strengthening national and regional knowledge management. They also supported reviving and improving the Regional Technical Support Mechanism by increasing the pool of experts including women, ensuring the use of local counterparts to retain local expertise, and providing unconditional funding and technical assistance.

On governance and steering of the Hub, participants agreed, inter alia, to build on existing structures and link to the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific and Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP).

Participants also agreed on the next steps for the Hub, including: discussing the link to the PRP at the PRP Task Force meeting in April 2018; establishing terms of reference (ToR) for the Hub’s management team; and tabling the dialogue’s outcomes at other regional meetings to get further regional buy-in on the positioning and nature of the Hub.

The event was co-organized by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UNFCCC Secretariat, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), NDC Partnership, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the Pacific Community and the Government of Fiji.

Of particular relevance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the theme of the Day was ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities,’ to increase awareness of the contributions of forests to sustainable cities, from cooling the environment and saving energy to providing health benefits and drinking water, and building resilience against floods and storms.

A special event was organized at UN Headquarters in New York, US by the Secretariat of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), with participation from representatives of Member States, and international, regional and non-governmental organizations. The event featured an opening session chaired by UNFF 13 Chair Amb. Muhammad Shahrul Ikram Yaakob (Malaysia); a panel discussion on safeguarding forests for sustainable cities and communities; and a general discussion on forests, sustainable cities and the 2030 Agenda.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) celebrated the Day at a special ceremony at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy attended by city administrators from Lima, Peru; Ljubljana, Slovenia; Philadelphia, US; and Mantova, Italy. The event featured the screening of the 2018 International Day of Forests video spot on forests and sustainable cities, and the launch of a FAO publication titled, ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities – Inspiring Stories from around the World.’ The publication highlights different ways in which cities around the globe have used forests and trees to improve the living conditions of their citizens, which may serve as inspiration for others. In 2012, Beijing, China initiated the largest afforestation programme in its history, which resulted in forests now covering more than 25% of the city plain. Karura forest in the central north of Nairobi, Kenya, once a crime-ridden area, has been saved from property development following a public campaign led by environmental activist Wangari Maathai, and has become a source of opportunities and recreation for local people and tourists. In Lima, a municipality afforestation project resulted in a park with trails and family recreation spaces while reducing the threat of natural disasters, including earthquakes and landslides.

Forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, supporting – climate action; clean air; food, energy and water security; improved well-being; and social cohesion.

The latest issue of the FAO forestry publication ‘Unasylva’ is also devoted to urban forestry in celebration of the Day. Looking at urban and peri-urban forestry, including its benefits, pitfalls, governance and challenges, the issue shows that forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, such as regulating climate, storing carbon, removing air pollutants, reducing the risk of flooding, assisting in food, energy and water security, improving the physical and mental health of citizens, and increasing social cohesion.

A special event was also held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, organized by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Housing and Land Management Unit, the UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section and the FAO Liaison Office in Geneva. The event showcased unique ways in which forests have gone “vertical,” with speakers presenting innovative ideas on urban farming, wood construction and architecture.

On the occasion, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) circulated a new infographic illustrating the benefits that tropical forests provide cities. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) showcased the battle for reversing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, made possible following the vision provided by the Government of Brazil and GEF support to create a network of protected areas and nature reserves. The Amazon Region Protected Areas programme, initiated in 2002, has exceeded all its targets and has recently been joined by two other key GEF-financed programmes. One will maintain tens of millions of hectares of forest land in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru; the other is an integrated project aiming to promote sustainable agriculture, which will reduce pressure on the dry forests adjoining the Amazon. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment) signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Airlines, focusing on greening the airlines operations. The memorandum outlines several action areas to promote sustainability, most notably the development of the ‘Plant one tree for every passenger flown’ project, in collaboration with the ongoing REDD+ programme in Ethiopia. The objective of the project is to plant nine million trees in the name of Ethiopian Airlines in different regions of Ethiopia.

Other recent developments of relevance included: two publications on REDD+ in Ethiopia and in Kenya; and the approval of a new US$33 million project, partly funded by GEF, to improve sustainable rural livelihoods and forest protection in Zambia. The publications examine, from a REDD+ point of view, the contribution of forests to national income in Ethiopia, and ways to improve efficiency in forestry operations and forest product processing in Kenya.

The set of 27 Policy Briefs on SDG 7 and interlinkages with other SDGs includes a new Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action. The Global Agenda is intended to serve as roadmap towards achieving universal energy access by 2030 and maximizing its positive impact on other SDGs.

The launch event took place on 18 April 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The multi-stakeholder SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group was convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) to support the review of SDG 7 at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2018. The Advisory Group is comprised of representatives of 50 organizations, including 21 from the UN system, as well governments, other international organizations and stakeholders.

The proposed Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action aims to catalyze time-bound and measurable actions, grouped into four interlinked categories:

Advancing SDG 7 implementation through: prioritizing clean-cooking solutions; closing the electricity access gap; accelerating the pace of transition towards renewable energy; scaling up investments in energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy; doubling global financing for SDG 7; scaling up capacity-building and education; enhancing innovation; and investing in data collection systems and data analysis.

through strengthening cooperation at the regional level and prioritizing ending energy poverty in the most vulnerable countries. Accelerating the transformation towards a sustainable and inclusive future by: promoting transformative investments; transforming human behavior from energy-intensive lifestyles to more sustainable patterns; strengthening decision-making through improvements in energy data collection, indicators and monitoring; and harnessing the power of all stakeholders to drive change.

Marcel Alers, UN Development Programme (UNDP), introduced the policy brief on financing SDG 7. He noted that there is a big financing gap for universal access to clean fuels, with current annual investment at US$240 million, versus annual funding needs of US$4.4 billion to 2030. He cautioned that investment is not spread equally, with developed and middle-income countries being able to access finance while many developing countries are currently left out. He emphasized that annual global financing for SDG 7 needs to double, from the current level of US$500 billion to US$1 to 1.2 trillion per year by 2030. He stressed that private finance is central to meeting SDG 7.

Noting that around 90% of the population is at risk of heart and lung disease due to air pollution exposure caused by inefficient use of energy, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO), presented the policy brief on energy and health. She announced that on 2 May WHO will launch new statistics on air pollution. She also underscored that all SDG 7 targets are critical enablers for universal health coverage and will advance progress towards achievement of SDG 3 (health).

Presenting the brief on energy and education (SDG 4), Rakshya Rajyashwori Thapa, UN International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said 300 million children are affected by the lack of energy in schools, 60% of which are girls. She noted that youth literacy levels are lower in countries with electrification rates below 80%, adding that efforts to electrify schools have lagged behind. She explained that the publication recommends, inter alia, adopting policies that incentivize and prioritize investment in energy access in the education sector, and catalyzing support through stakeholder engagement, public advocacy and outreach to influence decision makers.

Noting that more than 1 billion people lack access to electricity and more than 3 billion lack access to clean cooking, with women bearing the greatest burden of this energy poverty, Sheila Oparaocha, Executive Director, ENERGIA, presented the document on energy and gender (SDG 5). She said the publication recommends, inter alia: establishing gender responsive global and national energy sector policies; promoting and investing more in clean cooking technologies; and reducing barriers in the energy industry for women, while also increasing their representation in national and global energy bodies.

Rabia Ferroukhi, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), spoke about the role of SDG 7 in achieving SDG 8 (decent jobs and economic growth). She noted that renewable energy deployment has led to growing employment, and predicted that this trend will accelerate. She explained that the policy brief on energy and jobs recommends, inter alia: designing active labor market policies to respond to evolving market needs; coordinating education and training policies with the needs of the renewable energy sector; ensuring that jobs are decent; and undertaking measures to minimize disruptions in the energy transition through social protection measures and retraining efforts.

Sheila Watson, FIA Foundation, presented the policy brief on energy and transport (related to SDG 11). She explained that transport is the single largest energy user in many developed countries, while transport energy demand has been rising faster than in any other sector. She noted that energy consumption in the transport sector will continue to grow predominantly in developing countries. To respond to these trends, she said the publication recommends, inter alia:

implementing fuel economy policies to improve the efficiency of light and heavy duty vehicles and promoting electric and zero emission vehicles;

improving the efficiency of trucks, including fuel economy standards, and ‘green freight’ initiatives, including consolidated logistics;

phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies;

investing in safe walking and cycling infrastructure;

addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport; and

accelerating research in efficient batteries and energy storage systems.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative, UN Office of the High Representative of Least Developed Countries (UN-OHRLLS), said we must ensure that the most vulnerable will not be left behind. She identified two areas of action as essential: capacity building for countries on policy and project design for SDG 7; and facilitating access to finance for the most vulnerable countries. She added that political leadership and national strategies are essential for the achievement of SDG 7.

In the ensuing discussion, Denmark suggested reflecting this approach to SDG 7 in the HLPF Ministerial Declaration, and to highlighting at next year’s HLPF under the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that SDG 7 is essential to achieving all the other SDGs. Supported by Pakistan, she emphasized the need to focus on SDG 7 also as part of the Climate Summit to take place in September 2019 in New York, US. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) underscored the need for a conversation about rebalancing budgets to support sustainable energy.

Its outcomes will serve as a contribution to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF).

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum convened from 9-12 April 2018, in Indore, India. Its outcomes include: a dialogue among Asian mayors and city authorities on how the 3Rs and resource efficiency can make their cities sustainable; a declaration by cities; the launch of a report on the state of 3Rs in the region; and awards recognizing Indian recipients for their contributions to the 3Rs in their country.

The Eighth Forum’s theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3R and Resource Efficiency – A 21st Century Vision for Asia – Pacific Communities,’ focused on how the 3Rs, resource efficiency, and promoting the principles of a circular economy can contribute to achieving the targets of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). For example, a plenary session devoted to water noted how street cleaning, improved waste management infrastructure and practices, no open defecation, and basic sanitation services can reduce water pollution and water scarcity, improve the provision of clean drinking water, and reduce vector- and water-borne diseases, as well as improve resilience to natural disasters.

A plenary session on air examined how cleaner streets and the prevention of open trash burning reduces asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Participants also discussed ways to switch from the common practice in Asia of burning agricultural wastes such as rice straw, which reduces air quality, to recycling the wastes to produce bio-ethanol for use as fuel and chemical inputs.

Other plenary sessions addressed: how 3R principles and strategies can contribute to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems from land-based activities, particularly marine litter; how to “green” small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and get them involved in the circular economy; 3Rs technologies appropriate for addressing special waste issues, such as plastics, e-waste and medical wastes; and financing 3R infrastructure and programs. A parallel event examined strategies for addressing marine litter in the South Asia region.

During the Forum, a parallel Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue convened on the theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3Rs and Resource Efficiency,’ co-chaired by the mayor and commissioner of the host city of Indore, respectively, Malini Laxman Singh Gaur and Manish Singh. The Dialogue discussed the contribution of the 3Rs to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Guar and Singh discussed Indore’s efforts to meet the seven targets of SDG 11 before the 2030 deadline, including efforts on housing, transport, participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning, municipal waste management, green and clean public spaces, and disaster and climate resilience. Special sessions of the Mayors’ Policy Dialogue addressed waste challenges specific to Asian cities such as plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical wastes.

The Mayors’ Policy Dialogue concluded with the signing of the ‘Indore 3R Declaration on Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air in Cities’ by mayors and city authorities of 37 Asian cities. The declaration calls for collective efforts on 3R and resource efficiency and the signatory cities pledge to, inter alia:

Accelerate holistic waste management;

Implement local-level actions to make cities clean, safe, smart, resilient, resource efficient, inclusive and sustainable;

Partner with civil society organizations (CSOs), including integration of the informal recycling sector with the formal waste management chain;

Work towards a complete ban on the use of plastics in eco-sensitive or eco-fragile areas, including in tourist areas close to oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;

Work for wastewater treatment and reuse; and

Focus on effective management of special waste streams such as micro-plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical waste.

Two more cities signed the Declaration before the close of the Forum, and it remains open to signature by other Asian cities through 2030.

The Forum also launched a report titled, ‘State of the 3Rs in Asia and the Pacific.’ Mandated by the sixth Forum in 2015, the report is envisioned as a regular assessment of Forum member State progress towards achieving the commitments in the Ha Noi 3R Declaration (2013-2023) adopted at the fourth meeting held in 2013 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The 2018 report makes a series of recommendations, including: highlighting 3Rs as part of the global sustainability agenda, particularly SDG 12; continued prioritization of resource productivity, waste prevention and reduction activities; ensuring comparable and credible data across countries in Asia and the Pacific; and giving greater attention to e-waste, marine litter and coastal plastic waste, micro-plastics, food waste and food loss issues in the region.

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum was organized by the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ), and India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was attended by delegates from 45 countries, including government representatives of 28 Forum participating countries.

Created by the East Asia Environment Ministers Meeting in 2008 based on a proposal by Japan, the Forum is intended as a framework for high-level policy dialogue on the 3Rs among central and local governments, international organizations, aid agencies, research bodies, NGOs and the private sector. As of the Fifth Forum held in Surabaya, Indonesia, the platform was extended to include participation by Pacific nations, particularly the Pacific small island developing States (P-SIDS).

49,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-blockchain-in-practice/,"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Blockchain in Practice,"This week’s brief explores distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, and its potential for contributing to SDG implementation. As touched upon in February through the lens of financial inclusion, the international community is rapidly exploring the technology’s applications to sustainable development challenges.

Distributed ledger technology stores information on a decentralized system, where sealed “blocks” of data are copied and distributed across a network of peers, thus forming a “chain.” Although blockchain has risen in profile in the past several months as the underlying technology to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that uses the platform to enable the transfer of funds on a peer-to-peer basis, this is just one of its potential applications to development.

A white paper from the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development explains the underpinnings of the technology and outlines how it can be used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. The paper titled, ‘The Future is Decentralized: Block chains, distributed ledgers, and the future of sustainable development,’ is the first volume in a series that aims to show how blockchain can be used to build multi-stakeholder, cross-sector partnerships as well as mitigate potential risk. The Commission looks at six areas of application—development aid effectiveness, digital identity, remittances, supply chain management, energy and property rights—and indicates the SDGs to which they apply using the Goals’ icons at the start of each section.

The report’s foreword acknowledges recent political controversies and perceived risks in the technology’s nascent stages, but notes that blockchain should not be seen as a threat to existing governance systems. Some countries have banned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or expressed caution due to perceived risk of its being used for money laundering or financing of illicit activities. The report suggests means of mitigating some of the broad risks, calling for risk management rather than risk avoidance. A press release linked to the white paper describes how the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) are leveraging the platform.

Legislation needs to provide guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.

Delving into additional thematic applications and specific solutions, BlockX Labs’s Laura Marissa Cullell links blockchain case examples to the SDGs in an article on Medium. The post summarizes recent initiatives on SDGs 2, 5, 13, and 16 (on zero hunger, gender equality, climate action and peace, justice and strong institutions, respectively). Programmes implemented by UN-led funds and programs such as the World Food Programme (WFP) yield immediate savings by reducing transaction costs and international bank transfer fees. The DLT-based programmes also enable more transparent finance delivery to specific sites, where, for example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) administers its Green List of Conservation Areas. However, the article also notes challenges for blockchain, reminding readers that it is not a silver bullet: there must be buy-in and support from policymakers, as legislation needs to provide “guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.” Additionally, the lack of adequate infrastructure for high-speed internet access presents a hurdle in some contexts where blockchain applications could provide a solution to development challenges.

Applying blockchain to SDG-advancing projects does not necessarily mean working within (or even with) the UN system. The Plastic Bank, a for-profit social enterprise, seeks to address marine plastic waste in developing countries. The endeavor uses blockchain technology to track recyclable materials and the virtual currency tokens offered to collectors. A Sustainable Brands article featuring co-founder Shaun Frankson outlines his and co-founder David Katz’s business model, which can be scaled to contribute to SDGs 12 and 14 (responsible consumption and production, and life below water, respectively) on a global scale.

Virtual tokens and payments are not only becoming a viable option at the base of economic pyramid. Devex’s Sara Jerving sat down with a USAID consulting firm Konektid International, which is currently experimenting with using cryptocurrency both to receive payments from clients and to pay employees. In the article, Konektid CEO Mike Shanley notes that one reason for the switch is the avoidance of wire fees and the delays often associated with transfers, saying it’s “just a better payment system.”

GreenBiz Editorial Director Heather Clancy explains in a post from February 2018 how the technology can disrupt energy markets, including by advancing streamlined distributed grids. Linking blockchain to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), she writes that units of energy and smart metering appear to be a natural fit with the ledger system, which in turn can help generate verified renewable energy credits (RECs). Clancy also offers an example of how blockchain can increase transparency across products’ supply chains, which serves to accelerate progress on other Goals. She spotlights a Walmart-IBM collaboration kicked off in 2016 to demonstrate how better supply chain information can increase food safety (SDG target 2.1) and reduce food loss and waste (SDG target 12.3). The information gathered on the blockchain enables more strategic removals of tainted or questionable products, avoiding wasteful mass recalls.

In addition to these writings and projects, a number of recent events also examined blockchain’s applications for sustainable development. The Blockchain for Sustainable Solutions Conference took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US, on 2 March 2018. The agenda covered a range of sustainability and development issues that directly map to the SDGs, including climate change (SDG 13), deforestation (SDG 15), energy (SDG 7), water (SDG 6), food (SDG 2), transparency (SDG 16) and finance (SDG 17). A recording of the conference livestream is available on YouTube.

At the Global Festival of Action on Sustainable Development held from 21-23 March, in Bonn, Germany, Tauni Lanier posited that cryptocurrencies and their current popularity could be used to fund SDG projects, particularly in cities. She cited the inherent value of the environment and the transparency gains noted above as selling points for such a currency. An article on Development & Cooperation by Drake Jamali shares remarks from Lanier on new sustainable development financing methods such as diaspora bonds and social impact bonds, in addition to her comments on cryptocurrencies.

Discussions of blockchain’s potential for solving problems facing the international community have appeared in several other news items on the SDG Knowledge Hub in recent months. For further reading, see:

In January 2018, the UNFCCC Secretariat created the Climate Chain Coalition, which uses DLT to strengthen monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of climate actions, as covered by Leila Mead;

In March, a competition was held by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the UN Department of Management’s Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT) to use blockchain to combat child trafficking in Moldova, as covered by Catherine Benson Wahlén; and

Also in March, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted the use of blockchain in nuclear safeguards or machine learning in multilateral disarmament verification, as examples of ways for new technologies to support disarmament and non-proliferation, at a roundtable event in New York, also covered by Leila Mead.

Looking ahead, a workshop on ‘Blockchain for Sustainable and Inclusive Finance’ will take place on 25 April, in Zurich, Switzerland, convened by the Responsible Finance and Investment Foundation (RFI), the Swiss-Arab Network (SAN), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Bank of the Argentine Nation and European Partners for the Environment.

The agreement was announced at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of the GEF-7 replenishment.

The meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 April 2018. The GEF-7 replenishment will formally conclude during the GEF Assembly, which will convene from 27-28 June 2018, in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

The talks for GEF-7 included a review of the ‘Sixth Overall Performance Study of the GEF’ (OPS6), which notes that the GEF occupies a unique space in the global environmental financing architecture because of its broad focus and role as a financial mechanism for environmental conventions. Participants also considered programming directions during GEF-7 (FY19-FY22), and recommended updates to the STAR allocation methodology, including measures to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable GEF-recipient countries, among others.

The talks for GEF-7 were called for in October 2016, at the 51st meeting of the GEF Council, which requested the Trustee, in cooperation with the Secretariat, to initiate the discussions. Subsequently, meetings took place in Paris, France (28-30 March 2017), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (3-5 October 2017), Brasília, Brazil (23-25 January 2018) and Stockholm, Sweden (25 April 2018). Participants in the negotiations included: existing and potential Contributing Participants; representatives from non-donor recipient countries representing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean; NGO/CSO representatives from a donor country-based NGO/CSO and a recipient country; representatives of the private sector; and representatives of GEF Agencies and the conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism.

The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol. The GEF also funds activities in the areas of sustainable forest management, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.

Previously, the GEF Trust Fund was replenished by US$2.75 billion (GEF-1), US$3 billion (GEF-2), US$3.13 billion (GEF-3), US$3.13 billion (GEF-4), US$4.34 billion (GEF-5) and US$4.43 billion (GEF-6).

51,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/hotel-study-makes-business-case-for-achieving-sdg-12-3/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Hotel Study Makes Business Case for Achieving SDG 12.3,"5 April 2018: A “first-of-its-kind” cost-benefit analysis of food waste in the hospitality industry found that participating hotels were able to reduce food waste by approximately 21% in just one year, saving US$7 for every dollar invested. Titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste: Hotels,’ the findings have been welcomed by industry and sustainability actors for their potential contribution towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3, which seeks to halve food waste by 2030.

The report was co-authored by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and sustainability organization WRAP, with support from Walmart Foundation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands. Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive of Tesco and Chair of Champions 12.3, which commissioned the study, emphasized the need to take action right across the food chain in order to achieve SDG 12.3. It is estimated that one-third of all food produced in the world is never eaten, with food loss and waste accounting for around US$940 billion in economic losses and eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. At the same time, some 800 million people do not have enough food to eat.

Based on a sample of 42 hotel firms in 15 countries, the study found that the majority were able to achieve a 7:1 return on investment from buying less food and thereby reducing purchase costs, increasing revenue from new menu items developed from leftovers or foods previously considered “scraps,” and lower waste management costs. According to the study report, nearly 90 percent of sites were able to keep their total investment below $20,000, which was less than one percent of sales on average, with more than two-thirds recouping their investment costs within one year.

Yolanda Kakabadse, Board Member of the World Wildlife Fund US, stated that reducing food waste within the hospitality sector provides a unique opportunity not only to influence an industry, but to raise awareness with travelers globally. Marcus Gover, Chief Executive of WRAP, called for a “momentum for change in all hotels,” noting the study had clearly demonstrated that with simple measures, hotels can save money, protect the environment and still satisfy the needs of their customers.

The report outlines five actions for hotel owners and managers: measure the amount of food being wasted to know where to prioritize efforts; engage staff; re-think the buffet; reduce overproduction; and re-purpose excess food. It further proposes that by working together, businesses may also be able to share new best practices to make an even greater impact.

The report follows a 2017 study titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste,’ and is the first in a series of papers examining the business case for specific industry sectors. Analyses of the catering and restaurant industries are expected to be released in 2018.

52,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/non-party-stakeholders-provide-inputs-to-the-talanoa-dialogue/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Non-Party Stakeholders Provide Inputs to the Talanoa Dialogue,"2 April 2018: Since January 2018, the Talanoa Dialogue Platform has been receiving submissions from UNFCCC Parties as well as non-Party stakeholders on the three focal questions of the Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This article provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received before the 2 April deadline from non-Party stakeholders.

Inputs submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The online portal will remain open for submissions throughout the year. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), most submissions demonstrate that current emission trajectories and policies are not in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, highlighting that impacts of climate change are already being felt, while also emphasizing positive actions that are already being taken by various actors but which need to be scaled up. A submission from UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) underlines that current national climate plans – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – would almost deplete the carbon dioxide budget for a 2°C scenario by 2030, and far exceed the 1.5°C budget. It underscores that more ambitious NDCs will be necessary by 2020, building on the existing extensive knowledge about cost-effective policies and measures that can be taken. Analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) of a range of studies shows that, even if fully implemented, current NDCs would lead to between 2.7-3.7ºC of warming.

The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) submission takes the assessment a step further, applying an equity lens to the NDCs of 32 Parties, representing 80% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing whether each NDC represents a fair contribution or not. The CAT findings show that not only are global efforts insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but furthermore, the majority of NDCs assessed were found to be inconsistent with the CAT criteria of a fair contribution. According to the submission, only seven governments of the 32 reviewed have implemented 1.5ºC or 2ºC targets, four of which, it claims, are not backed up by sufficient policy action. The CAT submission also shows that currently implemented policies are expected to result in a further growth of global GHG emissions by about 9-13% between 2020-2030.

A submission from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) considers the finance aspects of the current state of play, noting that while climate-related funding is increasing, it is not growing quickly enough to keep the world on a 2ºC pathway.

Many of the inputs also make note of the climate change impacts being felt already. ActionAid International’s submission, on behalf of the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance (CLARA), highlights the “irremediable impacts” the world is already seeing due to the current overall “lock-in” of 1ºC of warming, including the loss of human development potential, negative impacts on livelihoods, and damage to ecosystem integrity caused by climate change and inappropriate land-use purposes and practices.

Actions being taken by private actors also form the basis of several submissions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) submission provides an overview of positive change and commitments undertaken by investors, including: globally, the share of low-carbon supply-side energy investments grew by six percentage points to 43% from 2014-2016; over 50 investors have signed a statement of support for the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and investors holding US$28 trillion in assets under management have signed on to Climate Action 100+, a collaborative five-year global initiative committing investor signatories to engage actively with the world’s top emitting companies. A submission from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that over 350 companies have committed to setting science-based targets, which are absolute GHG emissions reductions in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C. However, while these actions demonstrate a positive direction, the IIGCC submission underscores that the existing action could and should be scaled up, noting the need for governments to set the right enabling policy frameworks, including clear, long-term legislative programmes it highlights as “critical to the ability of investors to assess and manage climate-related risks and to invest in opportunities that support a low carbon, more energy efficient and climate-resilient world.”

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), many of the submissions highlight the emissions reductions and mitigation actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the adaptation and resilience actions required to ensure a safe future. In line with the official mandate of the Talanoa Dialogue, many submissions refer specifically to the long-term goal reflected in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, outlining the need to phase-out net GHG emissions in the second half of the century at the latest, achieve peak emissions in all sectors – energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture – by 2020, and consider the overall carbon budget as guidance for enhancing NDCs in 2020, with UNEP calling this the “last opportunity to close the 2030 emissions gap.”

Noting that the world’s major economies subsidize investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction amounting to US$18-70 billion per year, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) submission outlines the need to curtail fossil fuel supply as an essential part of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, outlining a vision for a managed decline in fossil fuel use. The submission highlights the potential for such a transition to result in social and economic benefits, including through the reinvestment of added tax revenues from fossil fuel production, particularly if these are redirected towards meeting the SDGs. The WRI submission also highlights the need to ensure a vision in which the SDGs and climate action are mutually reinforcing, noting that climate impacts have the potential for detrimental effects on the achievement of the SDGs, whereas well-designed climate policy measures for mitigation and adaptation can advance core development objectives, including health (SDG 3), decent employment (SDG 8), energy access (SDG 7), transport accessibility (SDGs 9, 11), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and landscape protection and biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15).

How do we get there?

Having identified the significant gap between current actions and policies and that which is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the submissions relating to the third question (How do we get there?), identify policies, plans and sectoral actions that need to be put in place to achieve the long-term goals. Underscoring the need to enhance ambition, the submissions also highlight opportunities for broader achievement of social and economic benefits, and interlinkages with the SDGs.

Setting long-term, low-GHG emission development pathways is identified as a key tool in response to the third question. The submission by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) underscores that “developing national and local long-term pathways is critical for the low-carbon transition,” highlighting the importance of creating broad stakeholder ownership of a long-term vision, as well as informing short-term policy decisions in light of deep decarbonization goals.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) submission highlights the economic growth and new employment opportunities that can be created through a transition to a clean energy future, noting that the millions of new jobs that will be created in activities related to deployment and maintenance of renewables and energy efficiency measures would “more than offset” job losses in fossil fuel sectors. Specific policy measures suggested within the submission include: ensuring the quick implementation of renewable energy targets in current NDCs; considering options for strengthening renewable energy targets in NDCs; and broadening the scope of renewable energy components in NDCs.

Many submissions note the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector. Noting that the aviation sector currently accounts for 4.9% of the warming impact on earth, and that international shipping is responsible for 2.6% of global emissions, Climate Action Network (CAN), with the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), and Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), respectively, call for decarbonization pathways for these sectors to be developed, detailing the measures that can be taken to make these achievable, and highlighting the sensitivity of these sectors to climate change impacts. The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) submission, on behalf of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the SLoCaT membership, identifies 20 “quick win actions” for the transport sector as well as a “global macro roadmap” to achieve a net-zero emissions transport sector by 2060-2080.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) submission also recommends action to be urgently enhanced, highlighting the mutually reinforcing nature of well-designed economic and climate policies, which it claims could add 1% to average economic output in G20 countries by 2021, rising to almost 5% by 2050 if the economic benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding or storm damage, are factored in. Specifically, the OECD submission makes several recommendations, for example to integrate climate imperatives into structural reform and broader national development strategies, including sustainable infrastructure, “reflecting the role of the physical environment as a fundamental pillar for strong, sustainable, balanced growth.”

Many submissions also note the importance of non-state actors in advancing climate action, including cities, civil society, and corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, among others.

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

54,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-analyzes-ocean-conference-commitments/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Analyzes Ocean Conference Commitments,"March 2018: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has published a summary and an analysis of the voluntary commitments made in support of the UN Ocean Conference and achievement of SDG 14 on life below water. The commitments covered all SDG 14 targets, with most relating to more than one. The most frequently addressed target was 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). By the text, a majority of the commitments were registered by governments, followed by NGOs and UN entities, with academia, the scientific community and philanthropic organizations registering the fewest commitments.

The high-level event titled, ‘UN Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ (the Ocean Conference), convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from 5-9 June 2017. As part of the outcomes of the Conference, stakeholders registered voluntary commitments for implementation of SDG 14. To date, 1,406 have been logged, and the registration continues. The summary cautions that a number of deliverables pre-date the Ocean Conference, often by many years, indicating ongoing projects.

In analyzing the voluntary commitments geographically, the publication finds that overall, voluntary commitments had good global coverage, spanning most countries and including almost all countries with access to the ocean. They covered all ocean basins, with most commitments relating to the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Regions contributing the largest number of voluntary commitments were Western Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania. The text notes that developed regions with high GDPs made commitments, but many of these focused on activities within their own regions. UN entities provided commitments covering the largest number of countries and global contributions, or contributions not targeting specific countries.

541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion.

The authors mention that using the best, currently available data, a total of 541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with the total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion. In addition, almost all the commitments include in-kind funding as well as staff and technical expertise.

The voluntary commitments will contribute, when achieved, an additional 2.85% to the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs). The increase in protected areas will add to the MPAs present today, covering 6.35% of the ocean. These actions will contribute to the achievement of target 14.5, and, together with the already proposed but unimplemented MPAs (about 1.3% coverage according to the World Database on Protected Areas), will help reach the 10% target, with approximately 10.3% attained by 2020.

The report also offers an analysis of how the voluntary commitments may contribute to the attainment of other SDGs. It shows close linkages between SDG 14 and SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, and SDG 2 on zero hunger. Voluntary commitments on SDG 14 were most often linked (by a count) to SDG 13 on climate action.

The report also reveals a number of gaps. On targets and priority issues within those targets, the publication notes that more attention needs to be paid to both the politically sensitive topic of fisheries subsidies and the issues impacting small scale and artisanal fishers. In addition, answering the many open scientific questions on ocean acidification should also be made an urgent priority. Other issues, such as marine biotechnology and innovative ocean technologies and engineering solutions, such as renewable ocean energy, the text observes, could also benefit from further attention. While there were no glaring geographical gaps, the authors mention that some adjustments might be necessary to ensure that efforts to increase scientific knowledge, capacity building, and technology transfer (target 14.a) focus on those regions and countries that need it most. This is also the case, the text underlines, for capacity building relating to ocean acidification research (target 14.3).

Noting the large number of commitments and the variety of the types of information submitted when registering them, the publication reports that some aspects of successful follow-up should include:

a framework, such a web-based registry, to review commitments and incorporate progress reports to assess individual and collective progress in a public follow-up;

defined methods, data and indicators to support follow-up;

regular reporting by commitment makers in a manner that accounts for diversity between commitments, while including common elements that allow progress to be summarized across targets and SDG 14 as a whole;

and maintaining momentum through face-to-face meetings, possibly at the margins of oceans-related conferences.

As new commitments are continuously registered, the authors mention that this analysis will be periodically updated. They further note that the Ocean Conference voluntary commitments should be analyzed in relationship to other similar commitments, such as those registered during the ‘Our Ocean’ Conferences or those found in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) related to the Paris Agreement as well as National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). They recommend a study that looks in detail into the collective impact of all ocean relevant commitments.

The event took place on 22 April 2018, at the Westin Hotel Grand Central in New York, US, in advance of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum). The Fair was organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), in collaboration with the UN Global Compact, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Addressing lessons learned about investment, Cristina Duarte, Cabo Verde’s Former Minister of Finances, Planning and Public Administration, noted that building institutions and regulatory systems conducive to investment can take 10-15 years, and it requires policy coherence and integration. Admasu Nebebe, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Finance and Economic Cooperation, spoke about the importance of investing in human development, noting that Ethiopia is currently investing 25% of its national budget in education. He observed that Ethiopia is the country with the third-largest public investment in infrastructure, which he said is also essential for attracting private investment.

The acting mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, said the local government has collaborated with the national bank of Colombia to develop a strategy to target extreme poverty eradication and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Sergio Londoño Zurek, who is also the Director General of the Presidential Cooperation Agency (APC-Colombia), also reported that 55,000 people live in extreme poverty in his city.

Anne Simpson, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), observed that the SDGs bring benefits for pension funds because they address risks. She said that after the 2008 financial crisis, CalPERS decided to rethink investment in terms of long-term value creation, and concluded that it needs to manage three types of capital: financial; human; and natural. As these three types of capital are also addressed by the SDGs, she said, the Goals are great for the sustainable investments that funds must harness in order to pay pensions.

Simpson moderated a series of presentations on successful PPPs in Kenya, Nigeria and Brazil. Ormat Olkaria III (Kenya) – the first privately funded and developed geothermal plant in Africa – reflects the importance of successful risk allocation between the private sector and public sector in achieving efficiency. The project was funded through two separate rounds of equity and debt financing, resulting in profits for the private investor and a decrease in energy costs for consumers.

Among the ingredients that led to the project’s success, Paul Mbuthi, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, noted the government’s focus on removing barriers to investment such as tariffs, as well as shouldering the high costs of the first explorations. Nachman Isaac, Ormat, explained what makes projects bankable and thus prone to success: long-term power purchase agreements; strong sovereign support, including support letters from the government; strong existing provisions that guarantee the recovery of a sufficient part of the investment; international arbitration; stable and predictable regulatory frameworks; and risk sharing.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) – OLAM Farmers Partnership (Nigeria) provides smallholder rice farmers with access to a profitable and reliable market, and OLAM with a consistent source of high quality produce. The project leverages multilateral financing from IFAD to attract funding from a large multinational firm (OLAM) to provide a consistent source of income to small-scale farmers, which, in turn, should lead to increased capital investment by the small-scale farmers. Odoemena Benjamin, IFAD, said multilateral agencies can help governments catalyze the necessary resources for projects aligned with national needs and priorities.

The Renewable Energy Market and Pacific Hydro Wind Farms (Brazil) was financed by a national development bank, and shows that private infrastructure investment can be successful even without financing and/or guarantees from international lenders. Based on the success of this project, Pacific Hydro is currently pursuing several much larger renewable energy projects in Brazil, illustrating how smaller investments can spur larger-scale, long-term investments.

The panel discussions were followed by thematic parallel working groups on ‘Large-scale, Capital- intensive Infrastructure,’ ‘New Investment Opportunities in Agriculture,’ and ‘Innovative Financial Instruments to support the SDGs.’

56,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sustainable-development-financing-report-pulls-alarm-on-short-termism/,"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Sustainable Development Financing Report Pulls Alarm on Short-Termism,"13 April 2018: Overcoming the short-term outlook of many investors is a complex but urgent issue, according to the 2018 annual progress report on financing sustainable development titled, ‘Financing for Development: Progress and Prospects.’ The report, which was prepared by the UN’s Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development (IATF), explains that while the global economy is experiencing a moderate upturn and momentum around sustainable investing is growing, commitments by the international community to create sustainable economies are not being met. As a result, the report indicates that the prospects of around 800 million of the world’s poorest people remain dire.

The report was issued on 13 April 2018, under the auspices of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), by mandate from the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development (AAAA). The publication sets the tone for the 2018 spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), convening from 18-22 April in Washington DC, US, followed by the 2018 meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development follow-up (FfD Forum), held in New York, US, from 23-26 April.

IATF is comprised of almost 60 UN agencies and international organizations, including the World Bank Group, the IMF, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Financial Stability Board.

Resources are not allocated where they are most needed, because the financial system rewards those who prioritize short-term profits.

The publication finds that per capita growth remains negative or insignificant in many countries where the poverty rate is already high, entrenching inequality. In the foreword to the report, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres observes that the world has the resources necessary to deliver, but they are not allocated where they are needed most. The IATF report explains that this is because the current financial system rewards investors, financiers and project managers that prioritize short-term profits. At the same time, the authors add, policy makers are excessively focused on short-term considerations.

The publication explains that this short-termism leads to, among other outcomes, infrastructure projects being shelved in favor of short-term priorities, and to the continued exclusion of small businesses and women from the financial system. The lack of long-term investment horizons also means, the report notes, that major risks, such as those from climate change, are not incorporated into decision-making. On the occasion of the report launch, Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for DESA, pointed out that without investing in infrastructure projects like bridges, roads and sewage systems, and if the poorest and women are cut off from access to credit and other financial services, there is little chance of achieving the SDGs.

According to the publication, the solution lies in a multifaceted approach, which includes:

Changing payment practices, from current compensation practices for financial advisors and portfolio managers that link to short-term results;

Requiring all listed companies in a country to disclose the financial risks they face from climate change;

Helping countries set up insurance-like mechanisms, with the international community supporting those that cannot afford premiums; and

Automatically reducing repayments for loans during crises.

Noting that major funders have not taken up these steps so far, the IATF report underlines the need for leadership to overcome short-term political cycles and to devise and enforce rules that have widespread benefits but may face resistance by powerful groups, such as tax reforms and stopping illicit financial flows.

Meanwhile, the Plastic Bank is using blockchain technology to incentivize the collection and recycling of plastic waste.

The Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance represents an agreement among the UK, Ghana, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Vanuatu to jointly tackle marine plastic. The countries have pledged to ban microbeads in personal care products and rinse-off cosmetics and to cut plastic bag use by 2021. The Alliance aims to drive action on SDG 14 (life below water) and to encourage other Commonwealth countries to sign up to and implement international agreements to protect the ocean, including the UN Clean Seas campaign, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative and the London Protocol.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance. This funding includes £25 million to support research on marine plastic from a scientific, economic and social perspective; £25 million to address plastic and other environmental pollution generated by manufacturing in developing countries and prevent this waste from entering the ocean; and £16.4 million to improve waste management at a national and city level, and prevent plastics from entering the water. Participating developing countries are also eligible to bid for support to improve their waste management systems and implement other initiatives to address plastic waste. In addition, the UK Department for International Development will match public donations to the Alliance.

The UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said, through the Alliance, the UK aims “to harness the full power of the Commonwealth in pushing for global change and safeguarding our marine environment for future generations.

The Alliance will work with business and NGOs, including the World Economic Forum, Sky, the Coca-Cola Company, Fauna and Flora International and WWF. Fauna and Flora International CEO Mark Rose said, “urgent and collective action is now needed to reduce the levels of plastic reaching our oceans” and expressed his organization’s commitment to help the Alliance achieve its aims.

Also on plastic pollution, the Plastic Bank aims to incentivize people in Brazil, Haiti and the Philippines to bring plastic waste to recycling collection areas. The Bank rewards plastic collectors with digital tokens that can be accessed by smartphone and exchanged for goods such as food, water or phone minutes. The Plastic Bank works with Cognition Foundry and IBM to implement this exchange using blockchain technology, which helps to ensure a cashless method that can support financial inclusion and minimize individuals’ risk of robbery. According to its co-founder, Shaun Frankson, the Plastic Bank provides an opportunity for “anyone with a smartphone and scale to create their own local recycling business and ecosystem.” The Bank plans to expand into Indonesia, Ethiopia, India and South Africa within the next year.

The scenario recognizes that extending current efforts, such as efficiency mandates, carbon taxes or renewable energy support, is insufficient. It argues that concurrent climate policy actions, and the deployment of disruptive new technologies in government policy environments to incentivize investment and innovation will be required.

In 2013, Shell published its New Lens Scenarios focused on mountains and oceans, which, for the first time, featured scenarios with energy-system modeling to 2100, enabling the viewing of long-term transitions in their entirety. These scenarios showed that the application of CO2-targeted policy frameworks would lead to net-zero emissions in the energy system by the end of the century. However, because this falls short of the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sky Scenario looks at a possible decarbonization pathway of achieving net-zero emissions from energy use by 2070.

Under the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040.

The scenario begins with the current structure of economic sectors and government policies, and assumes “very aggressive, but plausible,” ratcheting up of policy commitments through the first two global stocktakes (GSTs) under the Paris Agreement. It notes that, following the GSTs, greater uncertainties regarding policy implementation and technology development exist, which is why the scenario aims to be both ambitious and realistic by adopting an approach grounded in the energy system’s current reality combined with the long-term temperature goal.

In the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040. Liquid hydrocarbon fuel consumption would decrease by 50% between 2020 and 2050, and fall by 90% by 2070. The scenario also includes sector transformations in transport, buildings, industry, electricity and energy.

The Sky Scenario is based on the following assumptions from now to 2070:

a change in consumer mindset where people preferentially choose low-carbon, high-efficiency options to meet their energy service needs;

a step-change in energy efficiency;

carbon-pricing mechanisms adopted during the 2020s, leading to a CO2 cost embedded in consumer goods and services;

the electrification rate of final energy more than triples, with global electricity generation nearly five times the current level;

new energy sources grow by a multiple of fifty, with primary energy from renewables surpassing fossil fuels in the 2050s;

10,000 large carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are built, compared to fewer than 50 in operation in 2020; and

net-zero deforestation is achieved, and an area the size of Brazil is reforested offering the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Shell has also published quantitative data sets for the Sky Scenario for public use.

Shell is one of the world’s largest publicly traded oil companies, and produces approximately 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

The NAP Expo aimed to discuss country experiences, best practices, lessons learned, gaps and needs, and information on support provided and received in relation to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. It also offered a platform for countries to interact with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and others providing support for NAPs, as a means to improve access to financing for NAPs.

The event convened amidst alarm bells sounded by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who called for “a race to the top – with political will, innovation, financing and partnership” to counter “the most systemic threat to humankind” that is climate change. [Opening Remarks at Press Encounter on Climate Change by UN Secretary General António Guterres] [UNFCCC Press Release]

Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under NDCs.

The urgent need for adaptation action in light of the “relentless pace of climate change” is reflected in recent updates from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO confirmed the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to be among the most destructive on record, with damage costs exceeding US$250 billion in the US alone, and March 2018 to be the third warmest on record. [WMO Press Release on 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season] [WMO Press Release on March 2018]

The main topics of NAP Expo 2018 were: systematic observations, monitoring and evaluation, and learning from experience from past climate shocks; assessing vulnerability and risk; designing implementation strategies while taking into account vertical and horizontal integration, and different pathways over time; and financial support for the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

Areas of adaptation addressed at the Expo included: climate information services (CIS), climate data and scenarios; monitoring and evaluation; linkages among adaptation, the SDGs and disaster risk reduction (DRR); consideration of gender in NAPs; lessons learned from the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs); long-term adaptation planning and transformation; adaptation in the agriculture sector; water crises and other climate shocks; adaptation in human settlements; and applying traditional and indigenous knowledge. Emerging topics such as big data and artificial intelligence were also discussed.

NAP Expo 2018 was the fifth consecutive NAP Expo, organized by the UNFCCC Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) in collaboration with various organizations.

The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF) in 2010. Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The process is supported by the LEG and though initiatives such as the NAP Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) and the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs Programme (NAP-Ag). NAP-GSP is a joint programme by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to assist developing countries to advance NAPs. NAP-Ag, carried out jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and UNDP, focuses on climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector.

If you’re willing to part with a few hundred dollars US, you can get some serious hardware that a decade ago would have been effectively outside the reach of the hobbyist. Right now you can order a four channel oscilloscope for less than what a new Xbox costs; but which one you’ll rack up more hours staring at slack-jawed is up to you.

Of course, these “cheap” pieces of equipment aren’t always perfect. [Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking. Fortunately, the function generator accepts an external clock which can be used to increase its accuracy, so he decided to build one.

[Paul] starts off by going over the different options he considered for this project, essentially boiling down to whether or not he wanted to jump through the extra hoops required for an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). But the decision was effectively made for him when his first attempt at using a more simplistic temperature controlled oscillator failed due to an unfortunate misjudgment in terms of package size.

In the end, he decided to spring for the OCXO, and was able to use the USB port on the front panel of the SDG 1025 to provide the power necessary for the crystal to warm up and remain at operating temperature. After he got the oscillator powered, he just needed to put it in a suitable metal enclosure (to cut down external interference) and calibrate it. [Paul] cleverly used the NIST WWV broadcast and his ears to find when his frequency standard overlapped that of the source, therefore verifying it was at 10 MHz.

Hackers love accuracy, and accordingly, we’ve seen a number of frequency standard builds ranging from extremely cheap to luxuriously overkill.","[Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking.

64,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-devil-and-father-amorth,"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Devil and Father Amorth’,"The director of The Exorcist makes a documentary about the most famous exorcist of modern times. The result is not greatly to either of their credit.

“He who sups with the devil,” a wise medieval proverb has it, “needs a long spoon.”

William Friedkin, forever known as the director of The Exorcist, may or may not appreciate that proverb, but in The Devil and Father Amorth, a 69-minute documentary featuring Father Gabriele Amorth — perhaps the world’s best-known exorcist until his death in 2016 — Friedkin does interview two people who clearly do.

One is Jeffrey Burton Russell, a historian noted for a five-volume history of demonology who talks about how depressing it was to “work with evil all the time.” His advice: “Don’t concentrate on the devil all the time. … Concentrate on the good, concentrate on God, concentrate on the positive, and don’t think that much about the evil side.”

The other is Bishop Robert Barron, the winsome and media-savvy auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles and founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries. To Friedkin’s astonishment, Bishop Barron adamantly pronounces himself unworthy of “getting in close quarters” with the devil. “People like Father Amorth may be able to do it,” he says cautiously. “I would never dare to do it.”

Clearly, Father Amorth dares. Over a 30-year career, from 1986 to 2016, he performed what he claimed were hundreds of thousands of exorcisms (160,000 as of 2013), averaging up to nine exorcisms per day for years at a time — a furious rate that has elicited astonished criticism from sober Catholic commentators like canonist Edward Peters and apologist Jimmy Akin. (Full disclosure: I know both Ed and Jimmy, especially Jimmy, who is an old and close friend.)

Often wrongly billed as “the chief exorcist of the Vatican” or “the pope’s exorcist,” Father Amorth was never attached to the Holy See, but to the Diocese of Rome, where he was authorized to act as an exorcist but had no special title.

Still, as a co-founder of the International Association of Exorcists, the author of a number of books about demons and exorcism, and a frequent public commenter in the media, he was the de facto public face of the exorcist community. In this capacity, he was known for sensational, extravagant claims, most famously condemning the Harry Potter books as satanic in origin and pronouncing not only Hitler and Stalin, but all rank-and-file Nazis, to be demon-possessed.

None of this comes up in The Devil and Father Amorth. In fact, other than the 20 minutes or so of handheld video footage of the exorcism of an Italian woman — her ninth exorcism, administered on Father Amorth’s 91st birthday, less than five months before his death — we see very little of the celebrity priest himself.

Instead, after an extended introduction filmed at various locations connected with Friedkin’s more famous movie, including Georgetown’s iconic Exorcist steps, the balance of the film is largely made up of interview footage.

Interview subjects include a brother and sister who credit Father Amorth with successfully exorcising the sister, a second woman who is the subject of the present exorcism, and a number of talking heads. Among these are Friedkin’s Exorcist collaborator, the late William Peter Blatty, who adapted his own novel for the screen, and a number of eminent medical and psychological authorities who speak cautiously about the limits of their fields and diagnoses like dissociative trance disorder.

Friedkin makes much of the novelty of his filming of an exorcism, asserting that the Vatican has never before given permission for an exorcism to be filmed. Actually, the Vatican does not directly oversee all exorcisms worldwide, and exorcisms have been filmed before.

For instance, in 1991, ABC’s 20/20 filmed and broadcast the exorcism of a woman who was said to have been inhabited by as many as 10 demons, most memorably one who self-identified as “Minga.”

That 1991 broadcast included moments more striking than anything in Friedkin’s footage of Cristina, administered at the Society of St. Paul congregational residence in Rome where Father Amorth lived and worked.

Although Father Amorth tells us that the devil speaks and acts through Cristina, it seems the devil has little on his mind beyond angry recalcitrance.

The ritual begins with the priest, his long purple stole draped over Cristina’s shoulders, along with a large rosary around Cristina’s neck, thumbing his nose at the devil as he leads Cristina and about a dozen of her family members in the Lord’s Prayer.

Among others, Father Amorth invokes Padre Pio and his own mentor, Father Candido Amantini, who also performed exorcisms for some 30 years. On the wall over Cristina’s head is a photograph of Pope Francis, who has talked more about Satan than the last two popes combined.

Presently, Cristina becomes agitated and begins rocking and writhing in her chair, obliging others to restrain her. Her outbursts — generally inarticulate snarls and cries like “No!” and “Stop!” — are uttered in a voice that sounds unmistakably like an audio editing chorus effect. I am only a permanent deacon and a film critic, not a priest and certainly not an exorcist, but if Cristina’s voice hasn’t been digitally tweaked, for my money the devil needs a new sound design team.

Friedkin’s audio chicanery detracts from what seems to be the sincerity of the woman’s distress, whatever its origin or nature. The very humdrum nature of her outbursts supports their authenticity; a calculated or scripted performance would presumably be more dramatic.

“Send the priest away! I can’t stand it!” she cries. “She belongs to me!” She refuses to answer the priest’s questions about when the possessions began and identifies herself as “Satan” and “legion” or “armies.” At one point, Father Amorth sternly tells the evil spirit it is damned forever and gets the reply, “It’s you who are damned!”

One of the more intriguing exchanges is left untranslated. When Father Amorth asks her how many devils are with her, she says something that sounds like “80 million,” but on cross-examination clarifies as “80 chiefs” (Italian capi).

Sometime after the ordeal is over comes a bizarre coda in which Cristina and her boyfriend allegedly arranged to meet Friedkin in the town of Alatri’s Cathedral Basilica of St. Paul (“considered to be a sacred place,” Friedkin hilariously clarifies, in case this is unclear).

Friedkin offers a complicated account for why this encounter, which winds up taking place in another church, wasn’t filmed, but the bottom line is that we have only his lurid account, scored with screeching strings and dramatized with impressionistic images and sounds, blending the earlier exorcism with glimpses of the church’s interior. Make of it what you will.

Toward the end of The Devil and Father Amorth comes an anecdote that made me cringe. Father Amorth couldn’t wait to reach heaven, an acquaintance says with a chuckle — so that he could beat the devil with a cane. I hope the one-liner does the man a disservice.

If Cristina and Father Amorth seem sincere, the same cannot be said of the filmmaker. Beyond the audio effects and the suspicious unfilmed incident, Friedkin seems more interested in spinning his interview subjects’ answers than in hearing out their perspectives.

For Blatty — a practicing Catholic who researched the real story behind The Exorcist for a nonfiction account, and fictionalized it only when he couldn’t get the family’s permission to write the real story — the hunt for the devil was genuinely part of a larger quest for God.

Friedkin gestures toward this pious move in the closing seconds of the film, but there’s no hint of such a sentiment in the preceding 60-odd minutes.

Whatever Bishop Barron or others may have said about God or Jesus, virtually nothing of this sort made it to the screen. Nor is there any perspective on behaviors that might open the door to demonic influence: involvement in occult activity, magic or divination, for instance.

In a secular age, the mystery of evil can serve for some as a useful signpost to the greater power of good. Sometimes, though, people don’t see past the sign itself, and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in 1975, rightly warned against “obsessional preoccupation with Satan and the demons.”

There is little, if any, genuinely religious dimension to The Devil and Father Amorth. It’s basically a “boo” movie in documentary form — that, and an exercise in brand reinforcement and exploitation.

In an era of found-footage horror movies, genre fans may get a kick from the suggestion that there could be something to this “woo-woo” after all.

Pious viewers may be gratified by the film’s validation of their worldview and the reverential treatment of a conservative fire-and-brimstone clergyman. Skeptics will find confirmation of their disbelief in the film’s evident jiggery-pokery. Few, perhaps, will find much to challenge the preconceptions they sat down with.

Deacon Steven D. Greydanus is the Register’s film critic and creator of Decent Films.

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

The trends are particularly concerning regarding energy access and clean cooking fuels, whereas progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy is accelerating.

The publication provides a global overview on progress towards SDG 7 and its targets relating to energy access including access to clean cooking fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It concludes that the rate of progress on all targets is insufficient to achieve SDG 7. At the same time, the analysis shows that the rate of increasing access to electricity has recently overtaken the rate of population growth for the first time, and that energy efficiency is increasing in the industrial sector. The publication further notes that country experiences indicate which mix of targeted policies and international support can be successful in promoting clean energy and energy access around the world.

“We must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.” – Adnan Z. Amin, Director-General, IRENA

Presenting the report at the 4th Sustainable Energy for All Forum, held from 2-3 May 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin said, “the report is an important signal that we must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.”

Specific findings on SDG 7 targets include:

Access to electricity: One billion people (13% of the world population) continue to live without electricity. At current rates, 674 million people would remain without access to electricity in 2030. Experience in a few countries has shown that home solar energy systems or mini-grids are a promising technology to provide access in rural areas.

Experience in a few countries has shown that home solar energy systems or mini-grids are a promising technology to provide access in rural areas. Access to clean cooking fuels: Three billion people (40% of the world population) remain without access to clean cooking fuels. The resulting indoor air pollution causes approximately 4 million deaths per year. The main reasons for lack of progress are low consumer awareness, financing gaps, slow technological progress and lack of fuel distribution infrastructure.

The main reasons for lack of progress are low consumer awareness, financing gaps, slow technological progress and lack of fuel distribution infrastructure. Energy efficiency: Global GDP continues to decouple from growth in energy demand with energy intensity declining on average 2.2% per year, compared to 2.6% required to double energy efficiency by 2030. Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked.

Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked. Renewable energy: Modern renewable energy use (excluding traditional uses of biomass) has increased to 9.6% of global energy consumption and is projected to reach 21% by 2030 under current policies. This is insufficient to achieve the “substantial increase” required under target 7.2 and to mitigate climate change. While falling costs have accelerated growth in renewable electricity to 22.8% per year in some countries, electricity only represented 20% of final energy consumption in 2015. Growth in the use of renewables in transport and heating is much slower at 2.8% per year.

The note was prepared in order to advance discussions at the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48), convening during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany.

The document (FCCC/SBSTA/2018/INF.2) provides information on cooperative activities, initiatives and programmes since the SBSTA 46. On the relationship with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the document explains that the 2030 Agenda recognizes the UNFCCC as the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and that the UNFCCC Secretariat can help countries achieve the SDGs. It describes UNFCCC activities towards SDG implementation, focusing mainly on SDG 13 (climate action), as well as engagement with activities and relevant agencies for achieving SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 15 (life on land).

The document showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with UNEP, FAO and ILO, among others.

On mitigation-related cooperative activities, the note highlights implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the role of the NDC Partnership, which supports developing countries in implementing their NDCs and achieving the SDGs. It showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with, inter alia: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to support climate and SDG-aligned finance and investment action in the context of sustainable development; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) to enhance countries’ capacities to integrate adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs into activities in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work.

On technology, the note outlines cooperation related to, inter alia, the technology facilitation mechanism to support implementation of the SDGs. It highlights the Secretariat’s participation in the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and in the high-level seminar on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

The note also describes cooperative activities related to climate finance, capacity building, adaptation and action for climate empowerment (ACE). It underscores the UNFCCC’s participation in a review forum for the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, which discussed the role of teachers and teacher training, as well as implementation of education for sustainable development in achieving SDG target 4.7 (ensuring all learners acquire knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development).

Additionally, the note provides an overview of activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) that help achieve the SDGs. On SDG target 2.4, on ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices, the document highlights the UNFCCC’s role in identifying knowledge gaps around agriculture and fisheries that hinder implementation and scaling up of adaptation.

On SDG target 5.5, on ensuring women’s participation and equal opportunities for leadership, the document references knowledge resources on gender-sensitive approaches and tools for adaptation. On SDG target 11.3, on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the note highlights a synthesis report on adaptation in human settlements, prepared under the NWP, which shares key findings, good practices and lessons learned on adaptation in human settlements. Regarding SDG target 11.B, on increasing the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing mitigation and adaptation policies and plans, the document outlines the Secretariat’s efforts to catalyze climate resilience action in human settlements through an adaptation knowledge portal.

The document also describes NWP activities related to: SDG target 6.A, on expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes; SDG target 9.A, on facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries; and SDG 13. The note also highlights the potential of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform to help advance the SDGs, particularly SDG target 13.B, on promoting mechanisms for building capacity for climate change-related planning and management for local and marginalized communities.

The VLR, to be presented during the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), will be modeled after the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs Penny Abeywardena made the announcement on 1 May 2018. According to the press release on the announcement, New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs, and its VLR will highlight the City’s achievements in sustainability since 2015. The VLR will be presented during the HLPF’s “sessions dedicated to local government engagement.”

The VLR, produced by the Global Vision | Urban Action programme of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs in close collaboration with relevant NYC agencies, compiles and presents existing New York City’s data and programs, the press release notes. An article by Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, indicates that the VLR will look at the City’s progress on a set of key SDGs, and will both reflect on successes and identify areas where New York can learn from others to address remaining challenges.

New York’s Global Vision | Urban Action programme shares innovations in sustainability with cities and countries around the world, “using the lens of the SDGs.” Established in December 2015 by the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, the programme seeks to, inter alia: engage with experts and representatives from New York City and the international community interested in achieving the SDGs; organize public events, expert meetings, and site visits to allow participants to see the SDGs in action and learn from each other about successes and challenges they face; and research links between New York City’s sustainable development work, the Mayor’s commitment to equity, and the SDGs. Hiniker reports that since the establishment of the programme, the City has hosted tours, panel discussions and other events to discuss how NYC is localizing the SDGs.

Global Vision | Urban Action also identifies links between the SDGs and the 2015 ‘One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City’ (OneNYC), the City’s roadmap on economic growth, sustainability, and resiliency. OneNYC commits to lift 800,000 New Yorkers out of poverty or near poverty by 2025, to expand access to nutritious and affordable food, and to fight against climate change and strengthen resilience, among other goals. As outlined in the document, ‘OneNYC 2018: Progress Report,’ which assesses New York City’s progress on the plan, New York’s accomplishments so far include: a “record job and wage growth” and a “record low unemployment,” with gains in all five boroughs; and the lowest poverty level since the Great Recession. The report also notes that New York is the first major city or state in the US to commit to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels, and the first city to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The OneNYC plan is available on the OneNYC website, along with its progress reports each year. The website also includes a list of indicators and initiatives related to the plan, and links to the NYC Open Data platform.

The HLPF will convene from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, on the theme, ‘Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ It will conduct in-depth reviews of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

68,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-12-experts-highlight-need-to-focus-on-food-waste-plastic-clogged-ocean/,"Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG 12 Experts Focus on Food Waste, Plastic-clogged Ocean","4 May 2018: Experts in sustainable consumption and production (SCP) have taken stock of progress toward SDG 12 and brainstormed levers for faster change, in the lead up to the July 2018 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The two-day expert group meeting, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), featured in-depth discussions on climate action, ocean action, plastic pollution in the ocean, food loss and waste, and sustainable transport as they relate to SCP.

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is one of the six Goals for which governments will conduct an in-depth review at the HLPF’s 2018 session. During the expert group meeting, participants recalled that SDG 12 is the “least well resourced” SDG, according to a report of the UN Secretary-General.

On SDG 12 stocktaking and HLPF preparations, Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA, said the market is “not getting it right” on the true costs of consumption and production. He highlighted the extensively interlinked nature of the SDGs and targets, and called for using empirical information to decide which interlinkages to prioritize for action, but said these choices must be context-specific.

Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of Secretariat of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (10YFP) at the UN Environment Programme, reported on the formation of the ‘One Planet Network,’ a multi-stakeholder network that will serve as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12. Cecilia Lopez Y Royo Di Taurisano, 10YFP Secretariat, said most activity has taken place in the area of SCP readiness, with less activity in SCP implementation. She reported a notable increase in the number of SCP policies and instruments, but said approximately half of these are voluntary, and only 11% are financial instruments.

Participants discussed the need to make an economic case for SCP at the global level, and considered whether the private sector will respond to potential efficiency gains as an incentive to improve SCP, or only regulation. One suggested the need for better branding of SCP. On SCP’s interlinkages with other issues, a government representative highlighted her country’s toolbox to allow national focal points to bring SCP to the table of negotiations in other areas.

The idea that SCP is highly interlinked with other Goals continued to emerge in the session on climate action. Annika Lindblom, Finland’s Ministry of the Environment and Secretary General of the National Commission on Sustainable Development, said SCP “directs attention to the interface of climate and poverty.” She said Finland has combined the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change in order to address material usage and energy usage together. The framework is called ‘Carbon Neutral and Resource-wise Finland,’ and includes a medium-term climate policy plan to 2030 and action plans on procurement, product innovation and support for investments.

Hannah Janetshek, German Development Institute, said that while SDG 12 can have “strong co-benefits across the entire agenda,” it could also increase competition for resources, especially as policies seek to expand access to services in order to leave no one behind.

Mathilde Bouyé, World Resource Institute (WRI), said targets from SDGs 11 and 12 are poorly reflected in the NDCs, specifically 11.6, 11.c, 12.3 and 12.c. Jocelyn Blériot, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, added that so far, the focus of a low-carbon economy has been on energy, with less emphasis on raw material extraction and production. He called for an approach beyond ‘Recycling 2.0.’ With three billion new consumers coming soon, he said we must think differently, such as shifting from selling goods to selling services.

Suggesting that “most people don’t care about the impact of what they buy,” moderator David O’Connor, WRI, suggested that businesses should force people to opt out of positive behaviors rather than require them to opt in. Blériot suggested that regulations are needed in addition to business-led action, and said a number of governments are creating circular economy road maps, including Finland and France, in which businesses must consider what will happen to a product at the end of its first useful life.

In the course of the meeting, participants identified tradeoffs between SDG-related issues that have implications for SCP. These include:

Energy efficiency can be improved by certain thermostats, but recycling could be a challenge given the rare pollutants they contain. Similar challenges were noted with disposal of solar panels.

Lego plans to begin producing blocks out of sugarcane instead of plastic, but harvesting the needed sugarcane could increase land competition.

Plastics are part of the packaging innovations that have reduced food waste.

The interests of marginalized groups could come into conflict with the creation of marine protected areas.

Given these and other trade-offs, Gerald Singh, University of British Colombia, called for choosing priorities to prepare for “sub-aspirational” SDG scenarios. Bouyé said some countries are creating incentives and compensations for vulnerable populations who may be affected by SCP implementation. For example, El Salvador and France are among those including a climate solidarity package in their NDCs.

Wilberforce Kisamba-Mugerwa, Chair of Uganda’s National Planning Authority, reported that the HLPF is not sufficient for creating awareness of SCP, and urged involving sub-national leaders.

Edda Fernández Luiselli, Mexico’s Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources, said that in the Latin American and Caribbean region, sustainability must be promoted as a tool for competitiveness, not an environmental issue. She said that in LAC, the SDG implementors must be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which represent 80% of GDP.

Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, reported on efforts to link the existing ‘OneNYC’ plan with the SDGs, noting that after Hurricane Sandy, the City realized that prevention and protection must be equitable. She gave examples of New York’s waste management policies, such as ‘zero waste by 2030’, which includes bringing recycling to public housing and making public schools zero waste. She announced that New York City will present the first-ever ‘Voluntary Local Review’ at the 2018 session of the HLPF, and said it will map city-level efforts against the SDGs to enable discussions and exchanges with other cities and countries about best practices and filling gaps.

During the sessions on SCP and ocean action and plastic pollution in the ocean, Arthur Andambi, Permanent Mission of Kenya, said Kenya banned plastic bags in 2017. He announced that Kenya will host a blue economy conference from 26-28 November 2018, and noted that Kenya has proposed to host, along with Portugal, a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020.

Sian Sutherland, Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet, said the use of plastic for food and drink packaging represents a momentary use with consequences that last forever, and recommended that governments take action on this. Another participant noted that plastics play a key role in packaging innovations that reduce food waste.

Participants developed ideas for bringing together communities of practice around targets that are closely linked. Arden-Clarke suggested creating a working group on value chains, which could cover both food and plastics. He noted that the upcoming session of the Trade for Sustainable Development Forum will meet on the theme of sustainable value chains for SDG 12, and suggested that a working group on value chains could take advantage both of this event and the subsequent blue economy conference in Kenya.

Several presentations informed participants of the current status of plastic pollution in the ocean and efforts to address it. Speakers noted that plastic production is expected to double or triple within ten years, while the volume of additives in plastic and products’ complexity make recycling a limited solution. Participants observed that many consumers know about the problem, with one suggesting addressing the dynamic between consumer and retailer in order to “beat the speed of regulation.”

Recent actions taken to reduce plastic, as reported by the experts, include:

In the Maldives, schools have eliminated single-use plastics as of April 2018;

In the Netherlands, an affordable grocery store opened a plastic-free aisle;

The UK recently announced the Clean Oceans Alliance to reduce plastic waste in Commonwealth states;

In Switzerland, major supermarkets placed a five-cent fee for plastic bags, reducing demand by 80%.

Additional ideas were brainstormed, including:

Use extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies with regard to plastic packaging, as well as industrial fishing and the loss of gear;

Work with mineral water bottling companies to shift to other types of bottles, and hold a conference with the five largest bottled water companies in the world to secure commitments on going plastic-free;

Create legislation covering supermarkets’ responsibility, especially as some have said, “we would love to be legislated into” reducing plastic; and

Use blockchain technology to track ships, fishing nets and other aspects of fishing supply chains and manufacturing.

One participant said demand is only part of the solution, and legislation is required when producers and packagers are not ready to come to the table. A government representative said that despite regulations and laws, the petroleum industry can perpetuate a bad situation in a country through lobbying and investments.

On food loss and waste, experts including James Lomax, UN Environment, and Harry de Gorter, Cornell University, US, explained that in food and agriculture, unlike other areas of SCP, efficiency is not the problem. Calories are produced very cheaply already, which leads to consumption of the wrong food – non-diverse, high-calorie, and corn-based – in turn creating an obesity crisis. Moreover, when food is wasted, the water, energy and wildlife habitat used in creating the food are also wasted. However, decreasing production and consumption will increase prices. Redistribution of surplus is not the solution, Lomax stressed, and will only entrench the system of waste.

Participants stressed the need for consumer campaigns and public outreach, such as conducting food waste audits in schools. They also noted the importance of measurement and monitoring, such as through the food waste index led by UNEP and partners, and through initiatives to separate food waste from the waste stream.

On whether there is a business case to be made for reducing food waste, one participant said the westernization of diets is driving the crisis, and it is difficult to make a business case to address that. However, Richard Swannell, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), said businesses can experience a favorable rate of return on reducing food loss and waste in under two years, and companies that measure how much is wasted through the entire process of producing the food in the first place realize the need to reduce waste.

Regarding SDG 12’s status as the least funded SDG, participants suggesting linking food waste to other issues, highlighting that it is difficult to mobilize funding for what is perceived as a first-world problem. They also called for more measurement of gains from reducing food loss and waste, which will lead governments to invest.

The draft will remain under silence procedure until 4 May at 1:00 pm, and if there are no objections, it will be sent to the UNGA plenary for consideration.

In a letter to Member States, co-facilitators of the negotiation process Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, wrote that they count on governments’ “continuous spirit of flexibility and cooperation” so the membership can adopt the text as is and proceed “without further delay” with the changes required to ensure a UN development system that is “strategic, accountable, transparent, collaborative, efficient, effective and results oriented,” as called for in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR).

On ‘A new generation of UN country teams (UNCTs),’ the draft text requests the Secretary-General to work through the UN Sustainable Development Group, and in consultation with concerned Member States, to determine appropriate criteria regarding the presence and the composition of UNCTs, based on country development priorities and long-term needs and the approved UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). It further requests the Secretary-General to conduct a review of the configuration, capacity, resource needs, role and development services of multi-country offices, in full consultation with involved countries to improve their contribution to country progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda, to be presented at the 2019 session of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment (OAS).

By the text, governments welcome measures by the Secretary-General for advancing common business operations, including common back-offices, and with the target of 50% common premises by 2021, to enable joint work and generate greater efficiencies, synergies and coherence.

On ‘Reinvigorating the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC) system,’ Member States decide to separate the functions of the RC system from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative. They also decide to provide sufficient funding annually from 1 January 2019 through:

A 1% coordination levy on tightly earmarked third party non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source;

Doubling the current UNDG cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and

Voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

This proposal for funding the RC system, which the co-facilitators describe as a hybrid solution, was circulated separately in late April for governments’ consideration. The write that it represents an effort to reflect different views while ensuring the “necessary predictability and sustainability of resources that an impartial and empowered Resident Coordinator system will need.” The co-facilitators intend to circulate a technical note containing details on the key elements of the RC funding model.

On ‘Funding the UN development system,’ the text invites Member States to contribute on a voluntary basis to the capitalization of the UN Joint Fund for the 2030 Agenda at US$290 million per annum. By the draft, governments welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to launch a Funding Dialogue in 2018 with the view to finalize a Funding Compact in the form of a commitment between the UN development system and Member States. They further request the Secretary-General to report on the outcome of the Funding Dialogue at the 2019 OAS. They specifically note that the Funding Compact “relates to voluntary funding” of the UN Development system as well as other contributions.

On ‘Following-up on the UN development system repositioning efforts at the global, regional and country level,’ the text requests the heads of the entities of the UN development system, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, to submit a system-wide strategic document to the 2019 OAS.

The draft resolution also requests the Secretary-General to report to ECOSOC on progress in the implementation of the mandates contained in the resolution, as well as on the mandates contained in the QCPR resolution, as part of his annual reporting to the 2019 OAS. The Secretary-General needs to report also to the UNGA 74th session, for its further consideration and to inform the next cycle of the QCPR to be launched in 2020.

The report reflects on Africa’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and makes recommendations for integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The report titled, ‘Integrating and Tracking Performance on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: From Theory to Practice,’ urges countries to consider the interlinkages among the two agendas’ goals, targets and indicators to ensure horizontal and vertical integration of initiatives into national development plans. In the report, horizontal coherence refers to coherence between a national development plan and a country’s international development commitments and initiatives. Vertical coherence relates to synergies among goals, targets and indicators, such as between the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. According to the report, levels of convergence between the two frameworks include 90% convergence at the Goal level, and 69% at the target level.

To support integration, the report presents the UNECA’s integrated planning and reporting toolkit, which aims to facilitate integration of multiple development frameworks into national development plans and to track implementation progress. The toolkit is intended for use by line ministries and others responsible for development planning at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as for civil society and the private sector to track progress.

Users can apply the toolkit to evaluate the extent to which their national development plans and sectoral plans align with external frameworks. The software asks the user to identify the national goal, target or indicator that best matches the corresponding variable of the 2030 Agenda or Agenda 2063. If the goal, target and indicator is an exact match, the alignment is classified as “full.” If the national variable is a proxy, the alignment is considered to be “partial.” Variables can also be defined as having “no alignment.”

The software also facilitates performance tracking on all indicators of a country’s integrated national development plan.

He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

73,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/eclac-report-highlights-inefficiency-of-inequality/,"Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ECLAC Report Highlights Inefficiency of Inequality,"6 May 2018: A report on inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean region argues that equality should be at the center of development, as social gaps impede growth, development and sustainability. The report titled, ‘The Inefficiency of Inequality,’ was issued ahead of the 37th session of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

In the report’s foreword, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena writes that a “culture of privilege” inhibits progress, pointing to “colonial vestiges” in the region that normalize social hierarchies and unequal access to development benefits, political participation and production assets. Bárcena warns that equality, productivity and democracy cannot be substituted for each other.

According to the report, LAC is the world’s most unequal region. Tax evasion equals 6.7% of its GDP in terms of income tax and value-added tax alone. In addition, access to education, high teenage motherhood rates, and discrimination based on ethnicity and race continue to perpetuate inequalities. “Territorial inequalities” between different socioeconomic levels also exist regarding life expectancy, infant mortality, illiteracy and access to drinking water. These disparities are exacerbated by: the extraction of natural resources; low infrastructure investment; gaps in access to sanitation, electricity and the internet; and climate change impacts.

The ECLAC study contends that inequality negatively affects productivity, fiscal policy, environmental sustainability and the spread of the knowledge society. By contrast, it emphasizes, pro-equality policies produce positive effects in terms of social well being, and help to create an economic system with benefits for learning, innovation, productivity and environmental protection. The authors call for transitioning towards a development pattern that enables a “virtuous circle” of growth, equality and sustainability. The report recommends revitalizing investment and immersing the region in the “fourth industrial revolution,” focusing on decarbonization, and decoupling growth from environmental impact.

The report details three pillars of decarbonization, namely digitalization, sustainable cities and renewable energies. On digital industry, it suggests that the region prioritize broadband infrastructure, the information technology industry, and business capabilities for the digital transformation of business models, products and services. It also calls for developing a regional digital market.

On urban sustainability, the report outlines proposals for decarbonizing universal public services and appropriating technological change in urban areas, including developing national urban policies and coordinating them with industrial and technological policies at different levels of government. On increasing the penetration of renewable energies in electric power generation, the report recommends: harmonizing regulations throughout the region; substituting imports in production chains; internalizing social costs, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, pricing carbon and rewarding investment in renewables; reflecting the systemic risk of high-carbon paths; and regulating or standardizing bank financing for renewable energy projects.

The report also underscores the need to enhance transparency and trust in institutions, and strengthen international cooperation and multilateral institutions to make progress towards sustainable development.

UN officials also stressed the Territories’ particular vulnerability to climate change.

The meeting convened from 9-11 May 2018, in St. George’s, Grenada, organized by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization. Participants discussed ways to advance gains made in the Territories under the Special Committee’s purview, with many encouraging dialogue with their respective administering Powers, namely France, New Zealand, UK and US.

Currently, 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories (NSGTs) remain to be decolonized. They are: (Africa) Western Sahara; (Atlantic and Caribbean) Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Montserrat, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands, and US Virgin Islands; (Europe) Gibraltar; and (Pacific) American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Pitcairn and Tokelau.

Committee Chair Walton Alfonso Webson recalled that following the adoption of the SDGs, the Committee had stressed the importance of fostering economic and social sustainable development of the Territories. He said that conclusions from the last seminar acknowledged that climate change had exposed many of the Territories to even greater environmental and economic vulnerability. He called for efforts to continue strengthening administrative capacity, good governance and economic sustainability.

In a message to the seminar, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said “decolonization is still incomplete,” and cannot be advanced until Non-Self-Governing Territories can address a range of economic, social and environmental challenges. He emphasized that implementing the SDGs is important for Territories facing the challenges of climate change, access to health care, economic diversification, marine resource conservation and scarcity of drinking water.

During discussions, speakers highlighted: realization of the SDGs in the Territories is related to the extent to which the UN system provides the political space for their engagement; that achieving the Goals will increase possibilities for further advancement of self-government; the need for a mechanism to enable SDG implementation; and that the Special Committee should undertake discussions on the future development agenda in parallel with its decolonization efforts.

A number of speakers emphasized that the Territories cannot realize the SDGs if their economic dependency continues. One speaker said that in Puerto Rico, following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, it had taken three weeks for the response to get under way. Countries with full sovereignty are able to receive aid and take decisions on economic development policies more quickly. Cuba said it had not been permitted to provide aid to Puerto Rico following the hurricanes. Others cited “deliberate foot-dragging” by administering Powers, inhibiting Territories from taking action to ensure an effective response to climate-related events.

Also to improve Territories’ ability to achieve the SDGs, speakers called for increased communication between the UN Special Committee and administering Powers. They discussed how the Committee can help ensure that Territories serve as owners and drivers of the SDGs, and pointed to the importance of capacity building.

An elected official from a local council in Western Sahara highlighted a project on agriculture that will create jobs and efforts to promote tourism. Morocco noted its investments in the Western Sahara in such areas as public infrastructure and services, and said the Territory’s level of human development has surpassed Morocco’s national average. A representative from French Polynesia noted the development of SDG indicators within the framework of the Pacific Island Forum (PIF).

On the UN’s role in helping Territories achieve the SDGs, representatives of UN agencies drew attention to: the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) strategy for technical cooperation with the six UK Caribbean Territories, which will be in place until 2022; the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) technical support for a sexual and reproductive health policy for Anguilla, and its provision of emergency sexual and reproductive health kits to the Turks and Caicos Islands following Hurricane Irma; and UN Women’s efforts in BVI and Anguilla on gender-related issues.

Launched during the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 30 April to 10 May, the report recalls that the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the UNFCCC resulted in, inter alia: almost US$1 billion in financial commitments to address climate change; the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue, which aims to inform and inspire Parties as they increase their commitments; the first-ever Gender Action Plan; a platform for indigenous peoples and local communities aimed at the exchange of knowledge, technologies and practices; and an agreement on agriculture.

The report discusses goals for the year ahead, including: increasing the number of ratifications of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol so it can enter into force; concluding the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue in the lead up to and during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland; and adopting the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) by the end of 2018 at COP 24.

The report acknowledges links between the Paris Agreement on climate change, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), whereby action in one area benefits the others, and, in the words of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, pursuing the three together “increase[s] impact and efficiency” and helps transform peoples’ lives and ensure a healthy planet.

The report highlights the Law and Climate Change Toolkit, piloted in 2017 to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

On increasing the ability of countries to report on emissions, UN Climate Change 2017 activities included: training programmes for review experts on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and on biennial reports (BRs) and national communications (NCs); a handbook for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV); and regional training sessions and expos to help national experts prepare and finance national adaptation plans (NAPs), and align them with the SDGs.

The report highlights that, in 2017, the Adaptation Committee shared good practice on accessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and provided advice to Parties through the adaptation finance bulletin. In addition, the Secretariat launched the following: the Adaptation Knowledge Portal, which includes information and knowledge resources on enhancing climate resilience; NAP Central, a hub of information on creating and implementing NAPs; and ‘The Adaptation Exchange’ Facebook page, which disseminates knowledge, engages stakeholders and provides learning opportunities. At COP 23, the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) launched the Fiji Clearing House for Risk Transfer to help Parties develop and implement risk management and connect with risk transfer experts.

The report also provides an overview of climate financing, including: the GCF, with 76 projects and programmes, amounting to US$3.7 billion in direct funding and US$8.9 billion in co-financing; the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$4.2 billion in direct funding and US$38.2 billion through co-financing for over 1,000 mitigation projects, and over US$8 billion mobilized for adaptation; and the Adaptation Fund, which, as of March 2018, had committed US$476 million for adaptation and resilience activities in 74 countries. The Secretariat and the regional collaboration centres (RCCs) initiated the Green Investment Catalyst Roundtable to mobilize private sector finance for implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

On technology, the report notes that the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) launched three publications, and organized two major events, namely an innovation and climate change event, and a thematic dialogue on industrial energy efficiency and material substitution. The publications include: ‘South-South Cooperation and Triangular Cooperation on Technologies for Adaptation in the Water and Agriculture Sectors’; ‘Technological Innovation for the Paris Agreement,’ which highlights ways in which innovation can accelerate NDC and NAP implementation; and ‘Industrial Energy and Material Efficiency,’ which recommends policies for scaling up use of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial sector.

On building new partnerships, the publication reports that the Secretariat used COP 23 to pilot an initiative to establish links with a range of stakeholders on innovative ways to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention. During Climate Week in New York in September 2017, the Marrakech Partnership launched the Climate Action Leadership Network. At COP 23, the inaugural Yearbook of Global Climate Action was launched, showcasing the results of the Marrakech Partnership.

On developing effective climate legislation, the report notes, the Secretariat, together with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, piloted the Law and Climate Change Toolkit to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

Also, the report highlights an Asia-Pacific Climate Action Agenda developed under the Nairobi Framework Partnership (NFP) to promote enhanced pre-2020 ambition and the employment of carbon pricing instruments and policies, and improve access to finance.

He was speaking at the end of last week as 32 staff members of the SDG Centre for Africa visited Ntarama Genocide Site in Bugesera District to understand the history of Genocide against the Tutsi and how it was executed.

Ntarama has particular history of genocide since thousands were killed here as they sought refuge at the former church.

“The Genocide against the Tutsi was the worst attack on human rights, the aspect which SDGs must consider if the world is to achieve sustainable development,” he said.

“Many people read about Genocide against the Tutsi in books and other channels and it becomes difficult for them to understand. They should come and visit such memorial sites to understand first-hand,” he said.

Begashaw said that visiting memorials, remembering and supporting Genocide survivors are necessary steps to honour the innocent souls that were killed.

For Rwanda to fully recover from such situation, true love and unity must prevail, he said.

“What has been achieved in Rwanda is very impressive since many countries under similar conditions take much longer time to recover. We, however, have more things to do to ensure a better future,” he said adding SDGs promotes well-being and human rights for people.

He said that tolerance helps to manage aftermath of hard times like genocide.

“SDGs are about building people and helping them to understand what happened, fighting genocide among many other human crises. We have no room for this and should not leave behind human rights. With hardwork, we will getter a better future,” he added.

79,https://nationvalleynews.com/2018/05/17/sdg-ambulance-numbers-slashed-paramedics-begin-strike/,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Nation Valley News,SDG ambulance numbers slashed as paramedics begin strike,"CORNWALL & SDG — Many fewer ambulances are on the road now that the paramedics serving Cornwall and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry have begun legal strike action.

The paramedics are among 230 Cornwall city workers that went on strike this morning. The city, mandated provider to SDG of ambulance and a number of other services, failed to negotiate an agreement with involved union locals of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

As a result of the impasse, fewer ambulances and paramedics will be maintaining emergency service coverage in both Cornwall and the surrounding United Counties.

The city concedes that only three ambulances will respond to urgent and emergent calls during the day, down from the regular complement of nine. The nighttime roster drops from the usual six to just two union-staffed ambulances for the whole of SDG and the city. The cuts are imposed as per a previously negotiated “essential services agreement,” mandated by the province, that partly limits paramedics’ right to strike.

Echoing a warning issued by the United Counties, the city says that residents should only call 911 for medical in the event of “severe emergencies such as shortness of breath, chest pain, major traumatic injury or unconsciousness.” It advises taking a personal vehicle or taxi to the hospital, calling Telehealth Ontario toll-free at 1-866-797-0000, visiting a pharmacy, clinic, or doctor as alternatives to calling an ambulance.

“We have reached out to our partners, including area hospitals, fire services, police and taxi companies to ask for their assistance in responding to non-emergency calls during the strike,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services. “We hope this will allow us to focus on emergency calls only.”

During the strike action, no routine ambulance transfers will take place. But in the event of a “major emergency,” striking paramedics will still be called onto the job, the city assures.

“It certainly didn’t need to come to this,” said Amanda Palieps, president of paramedic local CUPE 5734, “but the City walked away from us on Tuesday afternoon and we didn’t see them or hear from them at all on Wednesday. We needed to be talking to hammer out a deal. It takes dialogue to bargain. Their absence tells us they were not serious about avoiding a strike.”

Main issues in the dispute include concessions sought by the City, and wages remain outstanding as well, according to the union.

Inside workers, represented by CUPE local 3251, have a strike deadline of May 23. Should they join their co-workers on the picket line next week, an additional 150 workers will be off the job.

“The city made what they called a ‘final offer’ on Tuesday,” said Alison Denis, CUPE National Representative. “Whatever they choose to call it, it contained all the same problems that yielded a 93 percent strike vote two months ago. Our members gave us a resounding direction with that strike vote. We’re very willing to try and find a resolution that works for both parties. But that would require the City to be here, actually bargaining. That is how this strike will get resolved.”

The paramedics have been without a contract since 2016.

Members of CUPE Local 1792, who work at long-term care home Glen Stor Dun Lodge, have also reached an impasse in their negotiations, but as they do not have the right to strike, their issues will be resolved by interest arbitration, according to the union.

The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.

More than 50% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. By 2050, it will be nearly 70%. This raises huge challenges for municipalities and city planners. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer the solution to many of these challenges. At the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN specialized agency for ICTs, we are working to develop the tremendous potential ICTs have to help build smarter, more sustainable cities.

Indeed, many cities across the world are already utilizing Big Data analytics gathered from smart sensors and connected devices to manage traffic, reduce energy usage – and improve a wide range of urban operations and services.

If we want to reach the targets set out by the UN SDG 11, we need to work together to develop the tools that will help cities become truly smart and sustainable.

To succeed, international organizations, national governments, municipalities and local partners from civil society, academia and the private sector need to join forces.

Taking Action

Thankfully, there are encouraging signs of such collaboration.

ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC) in 2016. U4SSC is now supported by 16 UN bodies, and over 50 cities have now joined ITU’s pilot project.

U4SSC has facilitated the development of internationally recognized key performance indicators (KPIs) which allow cities to set goals and measure progress on becoming smarter and more sustainable. The indicators, developed by international experts in ITU and UN bodies, fall under five overarching categories: the use of ICTs; physical infrastructure; equity and social inclusion; quality of life; and environmental sustainability.

Recently, many cities including Dubai, Singapore, Montevideo, Maldonado, Moscow, Valencia, Pully and Rimini have asked ITU for assistance in the implementation of the U4SSC KPIs. In the past few months ITU has published case studies on the efforts of Dubai and Singapore to apply smart city innovations, providing a valuable reference point to other cities pursuing greater efficiency and sustainability.

The creation of smart cities requires a trusted infrastructure capable of supporting an enormous volume of ICT-based applications and services, which in turn requires coordinated adherence to common standards that ensure openness and interoperability. ITU develops international standards to enable the coordinated development of Internet of Things technologies and their application in smart cities. They also outlined how smart grids can help to build more controllable and efficient energy systems. Work on standards for smart 5G systems, which will help improve the feasibility of smart processes in large urban areas, is underway.

More Efficient Cities, By and For People

Standards can be powerful agents of change. Their application allows cities to reduce energy costs and emissions through more efficient buildings, electricity grids, street lights, transportation systems, and energy and water networks at a time when cities already account for 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

But smart, sustainable cities are about more than just reduced energy costs and emissions – they also aim for the realization of a better quality of urban life for all. New intelligent solutions, underpinned by smart sensors, can improve the safety and well-being of inhabitants.

Here are just a few examples. In Singapore, sensors and cameras build on an existing digital system to enable the government to send signals to drivers to improve traffic flow. In Kolkata, a social enterprise is using geographic information systems to map unplanned settlements, providing addresses and vital services for the inhabitants. In Quito, a mobile platform for women to report sexual harassment on the municipal public transport system is improving the way the city is policed. Digital technologies are also used to enhance citizen engagement and participation.

A Radical Shift for Resilient and Sustainable Societies

The transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies requires the redesign of our cities as well as a radical shift in our patterns of production, consumption, and waste.

Digital technologies give us an opportunity to develop more intelligent and inclusive urban systems where waste, costs, and ecological impacts are minimized, and where urban operations and processes, increasingly cognizant of the multiple stakeholders involved, can enhance quality of life for all. These technologies give us an opportunity to drive success not just on SDG 11, but on several other SDGs, demonstrating the significant impact that ICTs can have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

But the transition towards smart, sustainable cities requires collective intention and increased collaboration between citizens, businesses, and governments. Together, we can design more efficient, ecological and people-centered cities, which drive, rather than hinder, individual well-being and sustainable development.","The 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), meeting from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, will review in depth SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land).

Some of these countries presented their VNRs at previous HLPF sessions (Benin, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Switzerland, Togo and Uruguay), and are updating their progress on the SDGs.

The VNRs were called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate the sharing of national experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. The “main messages” provide a brief overview of more comprehensive review documents that are prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts during the HLPF.

By 7 June 2018, main messages were available for 35 countries, including all of the Eastern European Group (EEG) countries that will present at the 2018 HLPF. Between 8 and 18 June, 10 additional countries’ messages became available: Benin, Mali, Republic of Congo and Senegal; Bahrain, UAE and Viet Nam; Colombia and Ecuador; and Andorra.

African Group

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized.

82,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unwto-report-links-sustainable-tourism-to-17-sdgs/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNWTO Report Links Sustainable Tourism to 17 SDGs,"6 June 2018: The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has published a two-volume report titled, ‘Tourism for Development,’ that makes recommendations on the ways in which tourism could contribute to sustainable development and the SDGs, and illustrates the global reach and positive effects of tourism on other sectors.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs.

The event took place from 5-6 June 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The STI Forum featured ten substantive panel discussions and a series of 90-second innovation pitches selected from numerous submissions related to the SDGs under discussion.

The STI Forum is a component of the UN’s Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The TFM also includes an Inter-Agency Task Team on STI for SDGs (IATT), a 10-Member Group, and an online platform.

Opening the meeting, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Marie Chatardova stressed the need for technologies to address the vulnerabilities of those most left behind. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Chef de Cabinet for the UN Secretary-General, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology and robotics, will generate new solutions to SDG implementation.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, said “STI roadmaps” serve as a practical building block for policy makers, the private sector, civil society and development partners to integrate STI into national development plans and budgets. He said the Bank will leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to: develop the foundation for sustainable, technology-led economies; expand the capacity of people and institutions to thrive in a society resilient in the face of disruption; and harness disruptive technology, data, and expertise to solve development challenges and manage risks.

Andrew Keen, author of ‘The Internet is Not the Answer’ and ‘How to Fix the Future,’ called for greater regulation of companies and data privacy, adding that the UN is the right place to begin this conversation. Miguel Ruíz Cabañas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mexico, called for the UN to collect and analyze information and develop best practices and exchange of information so governments can utilize technological change and AI while minimizing risks.

Arun Sundararajan, New York University, US, noted that it is not pragmatic to try to regulate online platforms, which will increasingly mediate people’s relationships with markets, but we need to negotiate with them as with institutions. He emphasized that we need to start a democratization of these platforms and ask them to come up with a clear, simple set of principles and take a positive role in society.

Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, addressed the environmental costs of technology. For example, the electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining equals the electricity use of the Czech Republic.

Peter Major, UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), said the CSTD focuses on the positive implications of big data to fight typhoid in Uganda and help farmers respond to food security and drought in India and other countries. He called for linking traditional knowledge with modern science, as well as examining ethical challenges and bridging the digital gap.

Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, United Arab Emirates (UAE), observed that, in order to achieve the SDGs, we will need to capture the data from ongoing experiments. Beyond big data, we will need access to data from other complex projects, she said. Thomas Philbeck, World Economic Forum, stressed that “the way we talk about technology matters” and asked for caution when using language that might lock us into dangerous narratives, such as fear or technology or “worshipping” technology.

For the SDGs to succeed in Africa, technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential.

Erika Kraemer-Mbula, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, stressed that for the SDGs to succeed, they need to succeed in Africa. She noted that Africa is estimated to double its population by 2050, and will have the world’s largest work force, comprised especially of youth. Microenterprises will thus be vital to employment, she said, and technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential for sustainable development. She called for thinking beyond education to learning systems that blend different types of science.

Suresh Nair, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India, gave an example reflecting the benefits of genetic engineering and biotechnology. To address the decrease in arable land as well as pressure to use less pesticides and the urgent need to increase food productivity, he highlighted “host-based resistance.” By using plants’ natural resistance, he said crop yield can increase, which lessens the pressure to convert forestland into farmland and prevents biodiversity loss. To that end, he recommended carrying out vigorous screening of crop germplasm to identify appropriate resistance against major pests and devise molecular tools to get a better understanding of insect pests.

During the Forum’s discussions, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) called for encouraging the development, transfer, and diffusion of technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms. He called for making the TFM online platform operational as soon as possible.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said internet access depends on a few major companies in the developed world, and LDCs lack the needed infrastructure to attract them. He stressed that access to information and communications technologies and the internet is essential to graduate from LDC status and not to relapse after graduation. He expressed hope that the Technology Bank for LDCs, inaugurated on 4 June 2018, will provide the LDCs with the support they need. Turkey noted that the Bank, which is hosted by Turkey, will strengthen the capacity of LDCs to scale up and deploy technology and innovation, and strengthen partnerships between governments, the private sector and other stakeholders.

Brazil called for addressing inequalities caused by the digital divide. Japan said that every country should develop an STI roadmap for each SDG to ensure no one is left behind.

The 2017 annual report is the fourth annual progress report on the implementation of UN-Habitat’s six-year strategic plan (2014-2019). The publication focuses on: ongoing processes related to strengthening UN-Habitat; specific challenges related to urbanization and human settlements and UN-Habitat’s response strategy; and UN-Habitat’s coordination role of monitoring and assessing implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the NUA.

Among the examples of the organization’s work in 2017, the report discusses UN-Habitat’s contribution to conflict resolution through addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus in Iraq, helping to reintegrate Yazidis, who have been victims of ethnic and religious violence. In alignment with SDG 11, other SDGs with urban dimensions and the NUA, UN-Habitat: provided emergency relief supplies such as water; constructed sanitation and health facilities; provided emergency shelter; and built capacities of local and national authorities in urban planning and management.

In an effort to promote the central role of housing in ensuring the sustainable development of cities and human settlements, UN-Habitat helped develop a Global Housing Strategy to assist countries in adopting strategies, policies and legislation for sustainable urbanization that ensures citizen engagement. For example, in Mexico, UN-Habitat helped provide housing by introducing a mechanism for measuring city prosperity, enabling the city of Zapopan to adopt a strategy that ensured the centrality of housing and individuals to all urban planning initiatives.

UN-Habitat coordinates monitoring and assessment of implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the New Urban Agenda.

To advance the SDGs by reaching out to low-income populations, UN-Habitat partnered with Infonavit, a Latin American mortgage lender, to ensure access to affordable mortgage financing. The report also highlights UN-Habitat and Infonavit’s collaboration on establishing an SDG Certification Programme for Housing, which will assess the compatibility of real estate development projects with relevant SDGs, particularly SDG 11, and provide real estate developers with greater incentives to develop projects that comply with the SDGs.

The report also discusses UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index (CPI), which offers tools for cities to formulate policies. The Index has been adapted to respond to SDG and NUA monitoring and reporting, and helps harmonize methodologies with agreed standards and indicators. The report explains that, inter alia: over 400 cities are implementing the CPI; 52 national statistical offices are using UN-Habitat’s tools and guidelines producing urban data and indicators that support SDG monitoring and reporting; 181 national and local authorities and partners have implemented sustainable urbanization plans and strategies; and 374 urban observatories are using UN-Habitat tools, methods and data in monitoring urban trends at national and local levels.

The report notes that mainstreaming UN-Habitat’s four cross-cutting issues (youth, gender, climate change and human rights) requires that every project contribute to the NUA and the SDGs.

According to the report, UN-Habitat’s financial performance on urban land legislation and governance reflects the importance of land in sustainable urbanization, risk reduction and rehabilitation. In addition to urban land issues, the Bank met or exceeded its implementation targets on research and capacity building, and development of methodologies to monitor implementation of the urban dimensions of the SDGs.

Underscoring that the current climate commitments are not sufficient to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5ºC above preindustrial levels, the statement calls on the G7 countries to take action consistent with their respective responsibilities and capabilities, including to fulfill existing pledges for climate action and support in the pre-2020 period, stating that many developing countries are “already committing to actions exceeding their fair share of the effort.”

The statement emphasizes the role of finance as “key to enabling an effective global response to climate change,” calling on the G7 to honor their commitments to increase finance, technology and capacity support, including in relation to the US$100 billion pledged to be mobilized annually by 2020, and to thoroughly examine how to enhance the transparency, reliability and predictability of such support.

The LDC Group statement calls on the G7 to “step up” with a “concrete plan to protect people and the planet.”

On national climate plans submitted to the UNFCCC, the LDC Group statement calls for the G7 countries to put forward more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that are in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and realizing the SDGs.

The LDC Group statement calls on the G7 to “step up” with a “concrete plan to protect people and the planet,” pointing to increasing loss and damage from climate impacts being faced by LDCs as a result of severe weather events which are affecting economic development, food security, health and migration.

On the G7 Presidency’s priorities, the statement welcomes the focus on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment, emphasizing the important role of women, youth, indigenous peoples and local communities in catalyzing climate action.

Looking towards the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC and the finalization of the Paris Agreement implementation guidelines, the LDCs’ statement highlights the need for progress throughout 2018 to achieve ambitious outcomes by the end of the year. It urges the “G7 and other countries that are not shouldering their fair share of the international climate effort” to enhance their commitments, underscoring that these should be informed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15) and the Talanoa Dialogue.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever. WHO announced that the number of new cases fell in April and May, meaning that the outbreak is no longer a national health emergency. [UN Press Release on Lassa Fever]

On 17 May, the UN marked the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) with a message urging an end to discrimination against LGBTI people. In conjunction with the Day, UNAIDS noted that men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the communities most affected by HIV. However, UN agencies report that more than 40% of countries criminalize same-sex relationships, effectively blocking gay and lesbian people from accessing healthcare and social services. UN Women, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UNAIDS are working with the Global Network of People Living with HIV to end HIV-related discrimination and epidemics of AIDS by 2030.

It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

By this decision, the functions of the Resident Coordinators (RCs) of the UN system in each country are separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said that, while the resolution is not seen by everyone as “the perfect document,” it represents a legitimate outcome of a multilateral process.

The consultation process on the resolution was co-facilitated by Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, and agreed on 7 May 2018 via silence procedure. The UNGA held a plenary meeting on 31 May 2018 to adopt the final draft text titled, ‘Repositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system’ (A/72/L.52).

The agreed text, inter alia: requests the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with the UN development system entities, to present an implementation plan for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system, including on the operationalization of its funding arrangements, to the UNGA before the end of the 72nd session; and endorses the transformation of the Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to assume managerial and oversight functions of the RC system under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary-General and under the ownership of the members of the ‘UN Sustainable Development Group,’ as a stand-alone coordination office within the Secretariat, reporting to the Chair of the Group (the Deputy-Secretary-General).

The funding arrangements for the new RC system are set out in a “hybrid solution” negotiated through the intergovernmental consultation process. UN Member States would provide the RC system with up to US$255 million annually, beginning in January 2019, through three sources: a 1% coordination levy on strictly earmarked, third-party, non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source; doubling the current UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Assembly following the adoption of the text. He announced that he will move immediately to put in place a transition team, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General, to implement Member States’ decisions. He noted that the reforms will enable the UN’s teams on the ground to better tailor their presence, skill sets and overall response to Member States’ priorities. In particular, the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) will better reflect country priorities and country needs, and the RCs will be impartial and empowered, with “development as their DNA.”

The Secretary-General emphasized that his preference would have been to fund the RC system through the regular UN budget, in order to ensure predictability, sustainability and ownership from all Member States. However, he noted, the hybrid funding solution put forward by the co-facilitators “is the best possible alternative.” He appealed to Member States for their immediate support so that the reforms starts to be implemented on 1 January 2019. Guterres added that the resolution represents the foundations to place sustainable development at the heart of the UN, and to advance the SDGs with poverty as the first goal.

A representative of the UN Secretariat explained that, in order to implement the provisions of the resolution, requirements amounting to approximately US$255 million would be needed on an annual basis, with the major portion of the requirements necessitating extrabudgetary resources. She expressed hope that front-loaded voluntary contributions will be received in 2018 to expedite the inception of the reinvigorated RC system as of 1 January 2019. She further added that the UN Secretariat’s share of the UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement pertaining to 2019 will be US$13-US$16 million.

In the ensuing discussion, India said the modalities for funding the proposals in the adopted text are “significantly different” than those contained in the Secretary-General’s initial funding proposals, ignoring the views and consensus of a large part of the UN membership on the need for predictable and sufficient resources for the proposed reforms. He added that the availability of resources remains unclear, and the proposed cost sharing for the RC system increases uncertainty. The US expressed the expectation that the reforms will reduce bureaucracy, improve performance, and increase flexibility for agencies to quickly respond to challenges.

The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Ethiopia for the African Group, stressed that the resolution “explicitly states” that the UNDAF should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national governments, through an open and inclusive dialogue between the host government and the UN development system, and in accordance with national development policies, tailored to priorities and the country needs. He cautioned that if the resolution is poorly implemented, the Group’s member states will bear the brunt of the costs, and this poses particular risks for the smallest and most vulnerable countries.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said the LDCs prefer no reductions in the country presence of the UN development system. The proposal of 50% common premises by 2021 should not incur any additional financial burden for LDCs, he added. He requested the UN Secretariat to ensure that the annual report on system-wide support to the UN development system provides disaggregated data and information on LDCs in every chapter, and has a separate section on LDCs highlighting the progress and challenges in these countries.

The EU noted that the agencies of the UN development system will be “in the driver’s seat.” Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), said the RC function is moving from being dependent on the infrastructure of a US$5 billion organization to that of an office that currently has a staff of 30. In this context, careful handling and maintenance of relationships is paramount, particularly during the transition period. CANZ added that the upcoming funding dialogue should be seized as an opportunity to explore how different types of partnerships can support the work of the UN development system and ensure an expanded funding base that moves beyond a small group of traditional donors.

Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) called for the reform to address multi-country offices (MCOs), and highlighted the need for dependable funding for small island states to implement it. CANZ welcomed the MCOs review.

Lajcak said the actions to be undertaken in the reforms to the UN development system cannot be considered in a vacuum, but the momentum needs to be brought forward into: the ECOSOC review and alignment process; the discussions on UN management reform and the UN’s peace and security pillar; as well as in Member States’ daily work.

The “repositioning” process began with an ECOSOC dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption, in December 2016, of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. The UN Secretary-General then delivered two mandated reports outlining proposals for reforms to the UN development system, in June and December 2017. These proposals were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings led by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, in January and February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” addressing questions raised by Member States during the briefings.

The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during ECOSOC’s Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), in February and March 2018. Petersen and Boukadoum then guided Member States in a six-week consultation process to agree on the resolution.

93,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/initiatives-push-for-sustainable-fashion/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Initiatives Push for Sustainable Fashion,"5 June 2018: Sustainable development is the new black, at least at the European Development Days and for a number of campaigns and initiatives working to increase sustainable production and consumption patterns in the garment industry. Efforts are building on internationally recognized principles and guidelines, and emphasize the benefits of transparency and traceability in garment value chains.

In conjunction with the 2018 European Development Days, which convened from 5-6 June, in Brussels, Belgium, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the European Commission (EC) hosted an event on transparency and traceability in garment value chains. The event titled, ‘Do you know where your clothes come from?’ discussed opportunities for ensuring a more sustainable clothing industry.

The UNECE-ITC-EC meeting was convened as part of an initiative led by UNECE and ITC to set up a multi-stakeholder platform and develop policy recommendations and traceability standards to guide the garment industry and contribute to SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The event addressed the many challenges to traceability and transparency, discussing for instance, fragmented production processes, and the prevalence of illegitimate subcontracting and undeclared informal work in garment supply chains. Participants gave the example of the numerous, up to 15 steps, such as yarn-making, weaving, and fabric-cutting, involved in the transformation of raw materials, like wool or cotton, into a finished garment. They noted how each step has its own environmental impacts as well as labor rights issues.

A UNECE press release points out that traceability can help companies identify opportunities for efficient and sustainable resource management, health risks, environmental impacts and labor rights. This, in turn, leads to increased transparency, making it possible to obtain accurate data and disclose it to consumers and the general public. In 2017, per the UNECE, one third of the 100 largest global fashion brands had traced and made publicly available their list of tier-one suppliers.

Preceding this event, in April, the UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (CEFACT) organized an event on ‘Traceability for Sustainable Value Chains: Textile and Leather Sector.’ It highlighted the need for a harmonized set of traceability standards in garment supply chains. A 2017 CEFACT publication titled ‘Textile4SDG12‘ provides recommendations on achieving these standards. The publication “identifies basic principles, possible solutions, and provides recommendations for an international framework initiative on transparency and traceability for sustainability patterns in the clothing sector, in support of SDG 12.”

In addition to these meetings, civil society-led campaigns are working to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards openness and accountability in the fashion industry. They include #whomademyclothes by Fashion Revolution and the Transparency Pledge initiated by the Clean Clothes Campaign, Human Rights Watch and the International Labor Rights Forum. The awareness raising initiatives seek to increase public awareness and channel consumer demand towards more company disclosure, leading, ultimately, to a minimum, common transparency standard.

The ‘2018 Pulse of the Fashion Industry’ report published in May further explores sustainability issues in the industry. The report “aims to give guidance to companies looking to start or find further advances toward more responsible ways of doing business, by sharing proven best practices and defining bigger and bolder steps the industry must take.” Another publication, ‘A New Textiles Economy,’ was produced by a coalition of fashion stakeholders and makes the case for creating a circular fashion industry that embodies the principles of sustainable production and consumption.

Many of these ideas and pathways towards greater sustainability in fashion – as highlighted in these campaigns, reports and meetings – build on internationally recognized principles and guidelines that define sustainability requirements for the sector. These include the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector.

94,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/dust-disrespects-political-boundaries-lets-act-together/,"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Guest Article: Dust Disregards Political Boundaries, Let’s Act Together","In March this year, an unusual sand and dust storm nicknamed ‘Mars on Earth or Orange Snow[1]’ transported and deposited dust that transformed European landscapes into a surreal orange-tinted scenery. An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

Speaking in Dar es Salaam on World Environment Day, 5 June 2018, Vice-President of Tanzania Samia Suluhu applauded the completion of 2,400 meters of seawalls, noting that the construction of a wall in the Kisiwa Panza in northern Tanzania prevented the area from sinking, while a wall in Pangani countered the effects of erosion.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim said that as sea levels rise, adaptation projects like seawalls are critical.

Around 800,000 Tanzanians could be impacted annually by flooding caused by the rising sea levels between 2070 and 2100, without significant investments in climate adaptation. Seawalls have already been constructed in seven sites along Tanzania’s coast, with financial support from the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Government of Tanzania.

The project to increase coastal area resilience is part of a broader UN Environment initiative to build climate resilience by improving natural ecosystems. The defense structures enable communities in low-lying areas and informal settlements to continue income-generating activities, such as fishing and agriculture. Mangrove and coral habitats restoration accompanied seawalls construction as they can act as natural barriers against wave and tidal surges. Solar street lights and benches were also installed along the seawalls.

The seawall completion announcement took place at the end of a week-long event to commemorate World Environment Day and raise awareness on environmental issues. The theme of the event was ‘Charcoal is Costly: Use Alternative Energy.’ The project will contribute to SDGs 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water), among others.

She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

The GOA-ON, a collaborative international network of 475 members from 80 nations, is committed to increasing global ocean acidification observation capacity in support of SDG target 14.3, which calls to “minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.” SDG target indicator 14.3.1 focuses on “average marine acidity measured at an agreed suite of representative sampling stations. It is within the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

In the 14.3.1 indicator methodology, experts provide detailed guidance to scientists and countries on how to carry out measurements in line with best practices established by the ocean acidification community. The methodology outlines how to collect information that is transparent, traceable and globally comparable. According to the IOC, improved observation and research on ocean acidification is critical for supporting scientific and governmental efforts towards climate adaptation and mitigation.

The GOA-ON Executive Council also discussed efforts to increase global ocean acidification observing capacity, in line with the Council’s UN Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitment. As part of its commitment, the GOA-ON is working to build capacity in regions that have limited observation and limited ocean science capacity. The Council and its Secretariat are organizing capacity building workshops on ocean acidification monitoring and experimentation best practices and providing sensor kits to allow scientists to collect reliable data and contribute to the global ocean acidification monitoring effort.

It's also a decent weight, an attractive as well as functional design, well constructed and reasonably priced to boot(y).

Pros: Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made

Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made Cons: The minimal padding might feel a bit too firm for some

The cutout isn't overly large compared to my previous saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow (which Lara tested in 2015), but it is well positioned and I found it does a great job of relieving pressure – absolutely crucial to a saddle's comfort. The Allure tips the scales at a respectable 268g (claimed 260g), just a shade more than the Diva.

> Find your nearest dealer here

SDG says this female-specific saddle is designed for all riding disciplines, and I found it performs well both on and off road. It is relatively narrow, at 143mm, and is only available in this one width; this, combined with the cutaway side profile, allows unrestricted leg movement, aiding pedalling efficiency. I actually prefer this narrowness to the 152mm-wide Diva.

It is quite long too, at 265mm, with a slim down-curved nose. This gives you plenty of room to shift your weight forward for climbing, while the seat's flat shape makes it easy to move around.

Construction

The low-profile Allure is made from high-quality materials and is well put together. It sports a lightweight nylon fibre base and LPU foam padding – although some might find the padding a bit too minimal. Compared to the more generously upholstered Diva Gel Flow, it has a very firm feel and it did take me a few rides for my behind to adapt to it. The Allure's wings are not as flexible as the Diva's either, although this didn't pose any problem, particularly because of its narrower width. Having spent several long days in the saddle, I can vouch for its comfort.

The Allure comes in two models: with titanium-alloy rails, tested here, or chromoly rails. The Ti-alloy version, as well as saving weight, is a little more forgiving because the titanium offers slightly more flex than chromoly, and helps absorb road vibrations. You pay for the privilege, though, as the chromoly model retails around £20 less, but then it weighs about 50g more.

Price-wise it compares well with others we've tested on road.cc. A lighter but similar sounding firm-rather-than-armchair option that Sarah got on well with is Fizik's Luce S-Alloy, at 250g and £86.99, and Tass liked the Specialized Ruby Expert, rrp £115 and weight 256g. But you can pay less: I really liked the £49.99 Fabric Scoop Gel saddle; no cutout but lots of comfort and not that much heavier at 273g.

> Buyer's Guide: 9 of the best women's saddles

Ultimately, I found the Allure very comfortable, and I'm impressed by its durability – the synthetic cover hasn't scuffed in a few months of riding, and it's easy to wipe clean. I also like that it doesn't look 'girly' and it comes in a veritable rainbow of colours so you can coordinate it with your bike.

Verdict

A firmer feel than some, but ultimately comfortable for long day rides and for off-road use too

102,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’,"The ‘fivequel’ (or a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) has nothing to say and no case for its own existence.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom runs two hours and 10 minutes, and if you bracket the first five minutes and the last five minutes, any random five minutes in the remaining two hours are probably more enjoyable than any random five minutes of the previous Jurassic World movie, and probably any five minutes of Jurassic Park 3.

There are images worth looking at, for one thing. Visually, not much from Colin Trevorrow’s 2015 Jurassic World has stuck with me beyond Chris Pratt holding three velociraptors at bay with hand signals and steady nerves (and later absurdly cruising alongside the raptor pack on a motorcycle).

J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage; The Impossible) has a better eye and a gift for atmosphere and creates painterly, sometimes powerful images. He also displays a Spielbergian gift for pushing the audience’s buttons. I jumped and laughed repeatedly, sometimes in the same five minutes.

As the five-minute stretches pile up, though, the movie goes back to the same tricks too often. The “bigger fish” trope is used at least twice too often, and the kitchen cabinet door from the first film becomes a dumbwaiter door here that is used repeatedly.

Eventually, all those five-minute stretches add up to two hours and 10 minutes that have to tell some kind of story that ought to be about something. Fallen Kingdom is a “fivequel” (or, if you prefer, a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) with nothing to say and no case for its own existence beyond brand momentum and the employability and photogenic looks of Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.

If Fallen Kingdom did have something to say, it might be about environmentalism and exploitation of nature. After the disastrous collapse of the new Jurassic World theme park (and hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements), the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar are on their own — and facing extinction from the island’s volcanic activity (a plot point going back to the original Michael Crichton novel, so we can’t ding the filmmakers for it).

This makes the dinosaurs objects of considerable preservationist concern and action. Howard’s character, Claire Dearing, now a crusading conservationist, might as well be a different character from the buttoned-up sexist stereotype of the first film (she’s closer in spirit to her park ranger in Pete’s Dragon).

Claire and Pratt’s one-time raptor trainer Owen Grady are no longer an item, but she manages to persuade him to join her on a rescue mission to Isla Nublar, accompanied by an anxious tech wizard (Justice Smith) and an ex-Marine paleoveterinarian (Daniella Pineda). To be clear, the mission is to rescue dinosaurs — a mission that occasions some debate, as well it might.

Unlike other endangered species, dinosaurs play no integral role in the balance of an ecosystem, nor are they valued by preservationists for their biodiversity (only the villains talk about the dinosaurs as resources). Instead, Claire’s brief for the dinos rests on human appreciation and empathy: We like seeing dinosaurs and they are living, breathing creatures that deserve our respect and compassion.

Neither consideration is without merit, though the waters are muddied by talk of “dinosaur rights.” (In Catholic moral thought, human beings have moral obligations regarding animals and owe them kindness, but animals lack by nature the capacity for moral agency and responsibility and thus are not properly subjects of “rights.”)

Backing for the mission comes from Sir Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell, affecting a British accent and an unwonted joviality), an old business partner of (and stand-in for) the late Richard Attenborough’s John Hammond. Cromwell’s household includes his unscrupulous right-hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), his stern housekeeper Iris (Geraldine Chaplin) and his young granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon), on hand to be this movie’s spunky menaced child.

Where the last film’s ruthless paramilitary figure was played by Vincent D’Onofrio in low-rent Brian Dennehy mode, this time we’ve got Ted Levine in low-rent Woody Harrelson mode. (Both D’Onofrio and Levine have much more interesting modes, so the slight is to the film, not the players.)

None of these characters is more than one-dimensional. Claire and Owen were one-dimensional characters in the first film, but now that Claire’s not an ice queen and Owen is at least less of a sexist jerk, I’m not sure they have even one dimension.

Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm is on hand, barely, to testify about the inevitable consequences of human irresponsibility. This sets up a contradiction at the heart of the drama that the filmmakers have no idea how to solve.

The dinosaurs can’t be contained on Isla Nublar or anywhere else. Not only does life always find a way, unscrupulous human efforts to exploit the dinosaurs will always offer the dinos opportunities to break free. Realistically, dinos are an unpredictable hazard not only to human beings but to whole ecosystems.

Yet our heroes love the dinos and want them to live — and the longer the franchise wears on, the more the movies love the dinos too, even if the “oo” and “ah” always gives way to running and screaming.

Of course even reconstituted dinosaurs ought to be treated humanely. At the end of the day, though, if it’s them or us, there’s only one right answer, and the movie seems to struggle with that. One line even seems to suggest that what dinosaurs really need is for humans to get out of the way.

Perhaps I’m thinking about this too hard, or perhaps the writers should have thought harder. Certainly the plot is one utterly predictable development after another (most of which my 15-year-old daughter actually predicted as the movie unfolded).

The last movie featured a genetically engineered hybrid supersaurus called Indominus Rex, a powerful, intelligent amalgam of T-rex and other species, most ominously including velociraptor. It was supposed to be ominous, anyway; I found it a lame reveal, since I had assumed that of course raptor DNA was in the mix and wondered whether the intelligence might reflect a more transgressive choice to mix in mammalian DNA, possibly even human.

Now they’ve got an even smarter, more advanced designer dino called an “Indoraptor,” a hybrid based on Indominus Rex, but with, you know, more raptor. What’s next, “Velocindoraptor”? Apparently velociraptor is the cowbell of dino design and the filmmakers are Christopher Walken. How is the imaginative scope so limited?

What makes this even weirder is that the Fallen Kingdom throws in some unrelated transgressive science involving human DNA, seemingly at random and with no connection to the main dinosaur theme. This goes nowhere and does nothing, at least in this movie. (Spoiler alert: The science in question involves human cloning.)

The first five minutes are soured for me by a particularly cruel killing of a random character overtly recalling a far crueler killing in the previous Jurassic World. (I assume this is cowriter Colin Trevorrow tipping his hat to himself.)

The last five minutes crash and burn completely as the heroes struggle with doing something unthinkable before taking a head-smacking cop-out to get the ending the movie wants, which is not actually the ending this movie wants, but the ending the next movie wants.

This is, more and more, the new normal in the evolution (or re-engineering) of Hollywood blockbusters. As audience expectations adapt, third acts and resolutions are becoming optional. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is what a movie looks like when the goal is less to send viewers home satisfied than to send them home anticipating the next movie, which is not the same thing.

When a case is referred to the Situation Table, the various partners in the project, which include school boards, the police, the Children’s Aid Society, the Cornwall Community Hospital and the Canadian Mental Health Association, meet and work together to reduce the imminent risk of harm, usually within 24 to 48 hours. The Situation Table remains involved in the case until the level of risk has been reduced.

“An early collaborative intervention from the Situation Table has proven it helps prevent crimes and improve the safety and well-being of the community and local residents,” explains Elyse Lauzon-Alguire, Situation Table Chair and Interim Coordinator. “Rapid mobilization Tables such as the CSDG Situation Table make police services part of a stronger safety net, rather than being the entire net themselves.”

Most situations that come to the Table concern a single individual, a family, or a group of people that are affected by multiple risk factors, including mental health issues, domestic conflict, addictions and homelessness. The CSDG Situation Table works to mitigate the risks rather than wait for a harmful incident that would require an emergency response, all while protecting the privacy of the people being assisted.

The study titled, ‘Wood Energy in the ECE Region: Data, Trends and Outlook in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and North America,’ highlights wood energy as the “overlooked renewable energy giant of the world.”

The report discusses types of wood energy fuels such as firewood, sources and users, policy instruments that support and hinder use, and ways to sustainably source wood.

According to the study, wood energy provides the majority of total energy supply in many developing countries, and nearly 25% in some developed countries, such as in Europe, where it is the leading renewable energy source. The report explains that wood pellets: are transforming wood use for heat and power generation in the UNECE region; are more energy-dense than traditional firewood; and support employment in the region’s forest sector through their production and distribution.

The report notes that wood energy can be stored, and provides energy without sun or wind. However, it can also lead to indoor and outdoor pollution if used inefficiently, and fuel wood harvesting can degrade forests without sustainable practices. Application of best practices to sourcing and processing can ensure that wood energy is clean and sustainable. For example, improved stoves and fuels can reduce fine particle emissions from traditional open fireplaces by more than 95%.

Improved stoves and fuels can reduce fine particle emissions from traditional open fireplaces by more than 95%.

In addition, wood energy use: can help mitigate climate change if used as a substitute for fossil fuels and if it reduces carbon emissions through sequestration; is scalable from small-scale residential units to large-scale industrial settings; and can support resilient and secure energy systems, as well as livelihoods across the UNECE region.

The report also, inter alia: describes how social, economic and political trends and developments may impact on wood energy use and sustainable production; includes statistics on wood energy markets across the UNECE region; helps bridge information about the forest and energy sectors; provides information on the role of wood energy in a range of sectors to support green economy strategies; and outlines commercial wood energy uses.

The report describes the role of public policy in helping to promote renewable energies, energy diversification, energy efficiency and security, and forest health, among others. As public policies influencing wood energy supply chains vary among UNECE member States, efforts are underway to streamline policy implementation towards more efficient outcomes. In addition, the report recommends that public policies affecting wood energy markets ensure, inter alia, stakeholder inclusiveness, incremental and permanence of targets, uniformity in incentives, flexibility in their application, and tailoring to local conditions.

The Joint UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section developed the report, with support from the Government of Finland and the UNECE/FAO Team of Specialists on Wood Energy.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

The website’s partners include Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics, the NDC Partnership, the UNFCCC, the World Bank Group, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ).

The Congress showcased new and emerging technologies for processing and using bamboo fiber and composite materials, highlighting its potential as a renewable natural resource.

Congress speakers and participants emphasized ways that bamboo and rattan can contribute to the SDGs on: no poverty (SDG 1); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); life on land (SDG 15); and partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): with reference to activities in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.

BARC 2018 took place from 25-27 June, on the theme of ‘Enhancing South-South Cooperation for Green Development through Bamboo and Rattan’s Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The Congress, organized by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NGFA), welcomed approximately 1,200 participants, including 500 visitors from 68 other countries. A ministerial summit and three high-level dialogues took place, in addition to 80 parallel sessions.

On SDG 1, speakers drew attention to projects that have promoted women’s entrepreneurship and empowerment through developing and promoting bamboo and rattan-based products. Terry Sunderland, University of British Columbia (UBC), called for a holistic approach and cautioned that calls for increased cultivation of bamboo should take into account land tenure and the role of women in economic activities, to ensure that rural communities truly benefit.

On SDG 7, participants discussed ways to expand the manufacture and distribution of bamboo charcoal, which is already being undertaken in Ghana, Jamaica and several other countries, noting the possibilities for small businesses in making bamboo charcoal briquettes, and the health benefits of substituting smoke-free bamboo charcoal for traditional fuels.

On housing (SDG target 11.1), discussions focused on construction standards and the properties of bamboo-based building products, including their lightness, flexibility, and superior insulating properties, as well as their resistance to fires, land subsidence and seismic activity. Participants noted that bamboo has been successfully used to build emergency shelters, and that the development of new types of resin, which used in conjunction with bamboo-based products, creates non-carcinogenic alternatives to treated pine.

On SDG 13, speakers highlighted the high levels of carbon sequestration in bamboo, and discussed methodologies for calculating the extent of sequestration. They noted that bamboo also has benefits for reducing carbon emissions in terms of emissions that are avoided by substituting bamboo for conventional timber products.

Regarding SDG 15, many participants expressed enthusiasm for cultivating bamboo to restore degraded lands and promote disaster risk reduction (DRR). They noted the value of bamboo as a critical food source for the giant panda, adding that conservation efforts around this iconic species could serve as “a giant umbrella” for the conservation of other species.

Discussions also touched on bamboo and rattan-related activities that promote food security (SDG 2), gender equality through women’s economic empowerment (SDG 5), and innovation in industry (SDG 9), with participants highlighting the market potential of bamboo across a variety of applications, including hi-tech and niche products in healthcare, sporting goods, and bamboo-composite building materials.

The conference adopted in principle the Beijing Declaration, which affirms INBAR member States’ support for developing the global bamboo and rattan industry through assessment of stocks, market and technology research, innovation, and standard setting. The Declaration calls upon national governments and other relevant parties to implement several recommendations, including, inter alia: carrying out inventories and assessments; establishing value chains accessing local, regional, and international markets by way of appropriate standards setting and quality control; encouraging bamboo and rattan technology innovation and research, as well as exchange of know-how. The Declaration also calls for investment from bilateral and multilateral financing mechanisms to support bamboo and rattan programmes and initiatives.

INBAR announced outcomes of BARC 2018 at the end of the conference, including several project agreements and upcoming meetings. Delegates noted agreement to initiate or extend several projects with UN agencies, partners, and donors, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Government of the Netherlands, the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainable Development, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), and conservation agencies willing to collaborate on the Giant Panda National Park that is being established by the Government of China. Further, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) offered to offset the carbon emissions generated by the Congress within the next 10 years through a bamboo-planting project in Yunnan province, China, thus making the Congress a carbon-neutral event.

Also at the meeting’s close, J.C. Hutchinson, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jamaica, announced a Caribbean Bamboo Conference to take place from 27-29 November 2018. It will bring together policy makers from the English-speaking Caribbean with experts from INBAR member States to discuss challenges and opportunities for bamboo in the region.

Official background notes are also available for each of the SDGs under review, and may be accessed by clicking the links in the headings below. Additional inputs submitted by intergovernmental forums, Major Groups and other stakeholders are available here.

SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation

The first in-depth review took place on 9 July 2018, on SDG 6, calling for greater efficiency of water use.

A UN-Water Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation finds that the world is not on track to meet SDG 6. Analyzing global progress towards each target, the report also highlights ways of accelerating progress through integrated water resources management, eliminating inequalities and other means of implementation (MoI). A summary write-up of the report is on the SDG Knowledge Hub here. A guest article also reviews the report, and the role of citizen science in monitoring SDG indicator 6.3.2. A side event on transboundary water cooperation highlighted progress towards 6.5.2, but noted challenges associated with lack of data, particularly around shared aquifers.

A report titled, ‘Global Review of National Accountability Mechanisms for SDG 6,’ commissioned by End Water Poverty & Partners, finds weak accountability mechanisms for water and sanitation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Based on reviews of 25 countries, the report notes, among other lessons, that few of the countries studied use third party validation, and that civil society involvement should be increased. A write-up of the report and HLPF launch event is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A second SDG Knowledge Hub guest article on SDG 6 by Emily Walsh, Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance, highlights the issue of asbestos in US drinking water, outlining how the SDGs can help align efforts.

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy

The in-depth review of SDG 7 took place on 10 July 2018, anticipating the end of coal.

The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) launched a report, titled ‘Delivering SDG 7.’ The report identifies current trends on energy use in transportation, noting how it is improving energy efficiency on a country-by-country basis. Working in over 70 countries, GFEI aims to accelerate the transition to zero emissions vehicles and reduce emissions from the freight industry. The report also outlines where references to fuel economy are found in countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) submitted to the HLPF. A press release on the report is also available.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) released a report titled, ‘New Energy Outlook 2018.’ Based on economic analysis, the report projects trends in renewable energy and fossil fuel costs, estimating that more than 50% of energy demands will be satisfied by wind and solar by 2050. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities

The in-depth review of SDG 11 took place on 11 July 2018, emphasizing the role of cities.

The UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) launched a synthesis report, intended to complement the Secretary-General’s overarching progress report on SDG implementation. Titled, ‘Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilience and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ the report’s chapters outline the importance of the urban dimension to the 2030 Agenda; monitoring efforts and methodologies; and the global baseline status of the targets and indicators under SDG 11. A press release is also available, as is a write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) released an analysis of countries’ 2018 VNRs to highlight the role of the transport sector in achieving the SDGs. The preliminary results show that, despite improving since 2016, there remain gaps on the inclusion of transportation and its contribution to sustainable development, despite the topic being mentioned in 95% of VNRs submitted. The report’s landing page notes that “80% of VNRs refer to the role of sustainable transport in achieving the SDGs but only 12 out of 40 VNRs (30%) offer considerable information with specific cases and policy examples on sustainable transport.” A summary write-up is also available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production

The in-depth review of SDG 12 took place on 12 July 2018, calling for circular economies and sustainable lifestyles.

UN Environment has launched a One Planet Strategy. Titled, ‘One Plan for One Planet 5 Year Strategy 2018-2022,’ the document outlines four common operation objectives, strategic principles and approaches across the One Planet network, which was formed to implement the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP) for which UN Environment serves as Secretariat. It also features an overarching logic model, noting the programme’s outputs, outcomes and impacts.

The Plan’s overarching objectives are to: 1) be an effective implementation mechanism of SDG 12; 2) catalyze ambitious action by providing tools and solutions that support the shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP); 3) lead the cohesive implementation of SCP; and 4) demonstrate the benefits and impacts of SCP and its role in addressing key environmental and social challenges. An overview of side events relating to SCP and SDG12, co-convened by UN Environment and the One Planet network, is available here.

SDG 15 – Life on Land

The in-depth review of SDG 15 took place on 13 July 2018, finding mixed progress.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) released its ‘2018 State of the World’s Forests’ report, which analyzes progress towards sustainable forest management for sub-indicators of SDG 15. The report finds that people who are furthest left behind often live in or near forests. FAO also recognized forests’ role in providing clean water (SDG 6), a source for energy (SDG 7), climate mitigation and adaptation measures (SDG 13), and recreational activities, among other SDGs. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Global Assessment Report was launched by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) at an HLPF side event. Titled, ‘Forest and Water on a Changing Planet: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Governance Opportunities,’ the report articulates the linkages between water management, forests and climate, and answers questions including: do forests matter? Who is responsible and what should be done? How can progress be made and measured? International governance systems and the SDGs, a press release notes, can optimize climate-forest-water relations by creating norms. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

An SDG Knowledge Hub guest article by Cristiana Pașca Palmer, Convention on Biological Diversity, notes that although there have been increasing commitments to implementing SDG 15, the data on available indicators show decline. She offers a ‘to do’ list for Goal 15. A guest article by experts from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identifies solutions that can help achieve healthy forests and ecosystems.

SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals

The in-depth review of SDG 17 took place on 13 July 2018, warning against trade barriers and calling for the fulfillment of aid commitments.

Launched during the HLPF Partnership Exchange the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and The Partnering Initiative (TPI) published a guidebook that seeks to amplify the benefits of partnerships. Titled, ‘Maximising the Impact of Partnerships for the SDGs,’ the guidebook outlines value added to both society and to individual partner organizations, describing how partnerships can be more than the sum of their parts. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Released just prior to the HLPF, a paper by authors from the German NGO Forum on Environment and Development, Unfairtobacco, Global Policy Forum, Misereor (German Catholic Bishops’ Organisation for Development Cooperation), and Bread for the World examines businesses’ contributions to the SDGs. Titled, ‘Highjacking the SDGs? The Private Sector and the Sustainable Development Goals’ the paper notes the difficulties of measuring business engagement with the SDGs, but offers recommendations for policy-makers, businesses and civil society. It features case studies on the financial system—with a focus on bond markets—as well as the tobacco industry. The paper, business-SDG engagement, and findings on the bond market were discussed at an event held at German House on 13 July 2018.

108,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/where-are-we-in-achieving-sdg-15/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?,"Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.
For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households.
Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection.
“TO DO” for SDG 15Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline.
Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important."

The authors express encouragement, however, that the country has committed CAN$100 million dollars in 2018 toward SDG implementation and coordination.



Paragraph 74 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development notes that follow-up and review processes at all levels should: be open, inclusive, participatory and transparent for all people, and support reporting by all relevant stakeholders. In this context, and in parallel to the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), some civil society organizations and coalitions from different countries have produced their own reviews and analysis, assessing government’s implementation of the SDGs and reporting on that implementation. These reports, often called “spotlight” or “shadow” reports, complement the official review process at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Produced by BCCIC, with the support of Global Affairs Canada, the report titled, ‘Where Canada Stands, Vol. II, 2018: a Sustainable Development Goals Shadow Report,’ supplements Canada’s VNR at the 2018 session of the HLPF by offering an “on-the-ground” civil society perspective. The BCCIC report assesses SDG implementation in Canada through the guiding question “who is getting left behind?,” and includes sections on each SDG to be reviewed in-depth during the 2018 HLPF. Those are: clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); life on land (SDG 15); and partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17). Throughout its sections, the report addresses four cross-cutting themes that illustrate the “intersectional nature of the SDGs and emphasize four key aspects of Canadian society that deserve attention and focus,” namely: Indigenous communities; gender; youth voices; and climate change. The sections also include case studies to “highlight success stories where targets were met and no one was left behind,” as well as recommendations.

The report indicates that natural ecosystems are being left behind in Canada as “progress is made toward economic targets.” On groups that are being left behind, the report identifies indigenous communities, youth, and women and girls, and notes that these groups, as well as subnational governments, should receive support from the federal government to carry out on-the-ground initiatives to meet SDG indicators. It also suggests involving these groups in Canada’s overall SDG implementation strategy, from planning to monitoring and reporting.

The report finds that Canada is lagging in meeting many of the SDG indicators. It notes, for instance, that: at the end of 2017, 67 rural and indigenous communities across the country did not have access to clean drinking water (SDG 6); recycling and waste management programs would need to be adjusted to ensure that the sector can continue to ensure long-term environmental and economic sustainability (SDG 12); and half of Canada’s monitored species have been under decline in the past several decades, and several populations of iconic Canadian wildlife such as mountain caribou are on the brink of extinction (SDG 15).

Statistics Canada’s ‘SDG Portal’ is still quite nascent and its contribution to the whole-of-government approach “is yet to be seen.”

Per the report, a primary reason Canada is not on track to achieving the SDGs is because the government has not established the necessary governance, monitoring, and reporting structures for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The report also indicates that Statistics Canada’s ‘SDG Portal,’ which it identifies as Canada’s intended single source for indicator data, is still quite nascent and its contribution to the needed whole-of-government approach “is yet to be seen.”

In April 2018, the Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development of Canada’s Office of the General Auditor issued a report on Canada’s preparedness to implement the SDGs. It concluded that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the Goals. However, it also notes that Canada’s federal budget, published after the audit concluded, provides for the establishment of an SDG Unit to support coordination of SDG implementation, and support for Statistics Canada to expand monitoring and reporting activities relating to SDG implementation.

In its VNR 2018 main messages, released in June 2018, Canada notes its commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs at home and abroad. Among other initiatives, it states that: federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how their policies and programs are contributing to the SDGs and their targets; the government will mainstream a gender-responsive perspective in the implementation of the SDGs; and it will launch a process to develop a national strategy on the 2030 Agenda through collaboration with all levels of government, Indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders. Canada will present its VNR on 17 July, during the ministerial segment of the 2018 HLPF in New York, US.

BCCIC is a network of civil society organizations and individuals based in British Columbia, Canada. The 2018 report builds on ‘Where Canada Stands, Vol. I,’ the 2017 civil society assessment of Canada’s progress on the SDGs, and considers both national and sub-national contexts through regional analysis. The report is also based on interviews with experts from indigenous communities, universities, think tanks, NGOs, civil society organizations (CSOs), youth, industry, and various levels of government.

During a session on integrating the NDCs and SDGs at national level, Michael Comstock, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted that SDG-related efforts contribute to NDC goals and vice-versa, given the “distinct but interlinked” processes. He highlighted research from the World Resources Institute (WRI) that finds climate actions align with 154 of the 169 SDG targets. However, he underscored challenges that hinder implementation, particularly the siloing of parallel processes with little communication between ministries despite substantive overlaps and potential duplication. Comstock outlined UNDP support to both the SDG and NDC processes, closing with a preview of a UNDP report titled, ‘Aligning NDCs and SDGs: Lessons Learned and Practical Guidance,’ to be launched later this year. [Presentation on Dialogue Objectives by Michael Comstock, UNDP]

Lee Cando, NDC Partnership, also stressed countries’ challenges of coordination, both horizontally across ministries and development partners, and vertically between national, sub-national and local governments. She flagged NDCs’ interdisciplinary nature, emphasizing that they cut across issues, and are not stand-alone climate or environment issues. Rather, they encompass a wide range of topics, including agriculture (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), transport (SDG 11) and forestry (SDG 15). [Presentation on Transforming NDCs into Action by Lee Cando, NDC Partnership]

Dialogue participants highlighted “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs.

Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute, presented the SDG Climate Action Nexus (SCAN) Tool for linking climate actions to the SDGs. The tool allows for analysis of trade-offs between SDGs that are in conflict, where progress on one may detract from or undermine that of another. However, for all SDGs, she noted, the synergies outweigh the trade-offs. [Presentation on SCAN Tool by Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute]

Representatives from Georgia and Armenia shared their countries’ experiences. Tea Avazashvili, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, Georgia, reviewed steps that the country has taken towards diversifying and improving its energy sources and security, noting policy developments around energy efficiency and renewables, which align closely with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Georgia’s key challenges for incorporating NDC and SDG actions, Avazashvili delineated, include low levels of awareness and lack of human, institutional and regulatory capacity. Asya Murudyan, Ministry of Nature Protection, Armenia, emphasized the country’s actions around adaptation as highlighted in its NDC.

With finance often being seen as an opportunity to join up implementation efforts towards the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, participants in the session on private sector engagement acknowledged “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs. Discussions covered strategies and means of implementation that are broadly recognized as contributing to both the climate and development agendas, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), an enabling policy environment and cooperation on green technologies to accelerate society’s transition towards more sustainable economic growth.

The Dialogue also featured discussions on how to integrate gender equality (SDG 5) into NDC implementation. Natasha Olofinskaya, UNDP, highlighted that gender is an enabling factor for all 17 SDGs, noting that it is not only supportive of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, but also has positive impacts on poverty reduction (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2) and health (SDG 3).

The report titled, ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation,’ offers the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) a “joint position from the UN family on the global status on SDG 6 and other water-related targets.”



SDG 6 has eight targets, addressing: drinking water; sanitation and hygiene; water quality; water-use efficiency; integrated water resources management; water-related ecosystems; and means of implementation. The Synthesis Report outlines the challenges faced under each of these targets, provides charts depicting country and regional performance, discusses accelerating progress on the Goal, and provides summaries of ‘key messages’ on each target. The report concludes with general recommendations, including adopting “smart technologies” and engaging in multi-stakeholder partnerships, among other measures.

On drinking water (SDG target 6.1), coverage increased from 81% to 89% between 2000 and 2015, but progress among the lowest-performing countries has been insufficient to achieve universal coverage by 2030. On sanitation (SDG target 6.2), access to basic sanitation services increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period, but rural areas lag behind, and managing fecal sludge has become a challenge. The report highlights that substantial investment will be required, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, to install sewerage networks and sanitation systems, as well as strengthen the capacity of local and national authorities to manage them.

While progress monitoring on water and sanitation drew on data from at least the year 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, Synthesis Report authors observe that there has been a shorter history of collecting data on the other SDG 6 targets.

On water quality and wastewater treatment (SDG target 6.3), the report notes challenges for both developed and developing countries, especially with regard to monitoring industrial pollution. Preliminary estimates suggest that, in high to middle-income countries, 59% of household wastewater flows are safely treated, while the extent of industrial pollution is unknown.

On water-use efficiency (SDG target 6.4), the report finds a wide range of efficiency levels across the globe, and calls for additional indicators and data that can reflect improvements in agricultural use of water, and reduced losses in municipal distribution networks.

On integrated water resources management (IWRM) (SDG target 6.5), the report finds that most progress towards implementation has been in the areas of cross-sectoral coordination and public participation at the national level, but levels of financing, action on gender issues and aquifer management still remain low.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG target 6.6), the authors report that the world lost 70% of its natural wetlands over the last 100 years. Artificial water bodies such as reservoirs and rice paddies have increased; however data collection systems do not differentiate between artificial and natural wetlands. They call for further detailed data on water-related ecosystems and their benefits, and for complementing local data with earth observation data.

On means of implementation (SDG targets 6 a. and b.), the report cites research findings that the capital investments necessary to reach SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are around three times the current levels of investment, and that investments in achieving other targets will also require a significant increase.

The authors argue that achieving SDG 6 is crucial for achieving the rest of the 2030 Agenda. They also emphasize the interdependence among SDG 6 targets, noting, for example, the energy sector’s role in water withdrawals, and the possibility of reducing water pollution to increase access to freshwater.

To help develop key messages to be conveyed to the HLPF, an online multi-stakeholder dialogue on the report was launched on 2 May with a briefing for UN Member States. The dialogue, which will continue through September, will seek input according to the following guidelines: overall feedback (2-16 May); main messages for the HLPF (25 June to 9 July); and looking forward and next steps (31 August to 14 September).

At the HLPF, further discussions on achieving SDG 6 will take place in the context of several water-related events. They include, inter alia: a half-day review of SDG 6 implementation hosted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); a UN-Water side event on global progress on water and sanitation; a ‘Water and Faith Communities’ side event organized by the Ecumenical Water Network; and a side event on ‘Ensuring Intergenerational Policy Dialogues for the Achievement of SDG 6,’ which will explore opportunities for greater youth engagement, organized by the Water Youth Network, UN-Water, the International Hydrological Programme of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IHP) and the World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW).

The IPoA report provides comprehensive information and analysis on recent progress in LDC countries, covering eight priority areas for action and the overarching goal of enabling graduation from the category.

Per the report, the UN Committee for Development Policy, held in March 2018, found that 12 of the LDCs had met graduation thresholds, occupying various stages in the graduation process. This shows a marked increase from the five LDCs that have graduated since the creation of the LDCs category in 1971. Among the 12 countries: Bhutan, Kiribati, Sao Tome and Principe, and the Solomon Islands were recommended for graduation by the Committee for Development Policy, while for Nepal and Timor-Leste, the Committee will revisit the sustainability of progress at the next triennial review; three of the LDCs, Bangladesh, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, met the graduation criteria for the first time in 2018.

The IPoA report notes the positive impacts of advances on access to information and communications technology (ICT), sustainable energy, human and social development indicators (for example, relating to health, education and gender equality, governance indicators and domestic resource mobilization. The publication stresses, however, that significant gaps that must be closed to meet IPoA goals. These include speeding up structural transformation and increasing the share of the LDCs in exports in world trade, as well as diversifying away from commodities. The report also highlights that: gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates fall short of the 7% target in most of LDCs; and that expenditure on social protection is still significantly lower in the LDCs than in other developing countries, corresponding to relatively low tax revenues. Other gaps relate to limited investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI) and stagnant official development assistance (ODA) flows to LDCs that remain below targets.

The IPoA report reflects decisions and actions by Member States on implementation, including the outcome of the mid-term review that took place in Antalya, Turkey, in May 2016. The report further highlights activities by other stakeholders, including the UN system, civil society and the private sector. It recommends that IPoA implementation be accelerated to ensure that its goals and targets are achieved by 2020, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

In July, ECOSOC is convening its annual organizational session and its Coordination and Management Meeting (CCM), which reviews specific development issues and considers special country situations or regional issues.

113,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/well-designed-citizen-science-projects-can-help-monitor-sdg-6/,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Well-Designed Citizen Science Projects Can Help Monitor SDG 6,"This year’s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) discusses SDG 6 on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. One major goal of the HLPF is to review the qualitative status of the targets so as to improve water quality by 2030.

One important indicator for reviewing targets is indicator 6.3.2: ‘Proportion of bodies of waters with good ambient water quality’.

Governments face here one major challenge: the water quality data gap. Whereas there are common indicators to measure water quality such as pH, temperature, or the total amount of nitrogen, such indicators are not measured thoroughly for a comprehensive understanding of water quality. As the 6.3.2 indicator report highlights, many custodian agencies lack institutional structures and coordination to collate data and mobilize necessary personnel (United Nations, 2018).

In hopes of tackling the problem, there are signs for a shift from traditional data gathering – government authorities monitoring water quality through extensive networks – to additionally gathering data through citizen-led water quality monitoring activities. The thematic review paper for HLPF focusing on volunteer groups specifically refers to SDG 6, pinpointing the importance of citizens testing water samples in ensuring safe water and sanitation for all (HLPF, 2018).

‘Citizen Science’: Is it really useful to address the water quality data gap?

A relatively new concept, citizen-led monitoring is also referred to as ‘Citizen Science.’ It is one of the avenues suggested by the custodian agencies of SDG 6.3.2. But is the involvement of citizens really useful to address the water quality data gap?

According to Oxford Dictionary (2018), citizen science is “the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.” In other words, it refers to the involvement of citizens in scientific projects.

Such involvement can have important advantages, particularly in data collection. Because any citizen can go out to collect data, data samples are potentially large. Such data can also be collected in a cost-effective manner, and it can speed up and improve environmental detection. In other words, the more people are collecting good quality data, the higher the chances of detecting environmental changes early on.

Citizen science thus makes projects possible to operate at larger geographic scales and over longer periods of time, depending on available human and capital resources. For instance, the National Water Quality Monitoring Council points out that there are more than 1,720 citizen science groups just across the US, carrying out volunteer water quality monitoring (National Water Quality Monitoring Council n.d.). Earthwatch supported approximately 1,400 field research projects in more than 120 countries, as well as over 100,000 people joining Earthwatch projects to contribute 10 million hours of data collection (FreshWaterWatch n.d.).

However, literature points out that citizen science also has shortcomings. Collected data by volunteers may be skewed or biased because the volunteers may not have appropriate scientific knowledge and training to gather accurate data. Also, motivating volunteers to participate in water quality monitoring scientific projects can be quite difficult since volunteers may also lack necessary laboratory equipment and funding for proper data collection. Lastly, people tend to be selective about which citizen science project they participate in because interests vary. Particular public attention and funding, for example, are given to biodiversity monitoring of attractive species such as wolves, bears, and certain birds (McKinley et al., 2017).

The way forward for citizen science in water quality monitoring

Vigorous discussion is ongoing on how to overcome these obstacles in citizen science. The motivation of non-scientists to participate in citizen science can be increased by providing recognition and attribution for the work they have done, and when they gain feedback from the scientists on how their data were put to use. Analyses also point to increased motivation when the volunteers felt involved within the community. Furthermore, citizen science data can also have high statistical power if data samples are large, which has potential for correcting flawed and biased data.

So, is citizen science an effective method for tackling the water quality data gap? Literature reviews and a quick review of citizen science projects suggest that involving citizens in water quality monitoring has strong potential, that’s for sure. But to fully benefit from the involvement of citizens, possible bottlenecks have to be overcome.

At the United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we thus argue for well-designed citizen science projects in the field of water quality monitoring, considering lessons learnt from existing projects and other fields of practice. The custodian agencies could consider providing guidelines for good citizen science projects and encourage Member States to implement well-designed citizen science projects for resolving the water quality data gap.

Launched in the margins of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the roadmap identifies the most “material” Goals and targets for the chemical industry.

The publication recalls the Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s (BSDC) flagship report of January 2017, titled, ‘Better Business, Better World,’ which emphasized a need for companies to coalesce around common sector roadmaps that can guide each industry’s shift towards sustainable development. In response, WBCSD pioneered a set of SDG Sector Roadmap Guidelines that can be applied to any industry seeking to develop a roadmap.

The Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap is the first of its kind, piloting WBCSD’s three-step approach as articulated in the general guidelines. The roadmap aims to build understanding on: the chemical sector’s current level of SDG interaction across the value chain; areas where the sector can make the largest contribution to the SDGs; and short-, medium- and long-term actions that can deliver meaningful SDG impact.

Private sector participants at other HLPF side events noted that the chemical sector is the “industry of industries,” meaning its reach can affect all areas of production. Against this context, the roadmap identifies ten of the 17 SDGs as being of higher priority: Goals 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 . These Goals stood out, the roadmap notes, based on: an analysis of how the chemical sector value chain interacts with each SDG; an exploration of the sector’s positive and negative impacts on the Goals; an assessment of the sector’s potential to impact each Goal; and a mapping of the SDGs in a materiality matrix to understand sectoral priorities.

As a US$4 trillion industry employing 20 million people, the Roadmap notes, the chemical sector has opportunities to be found through managing its own operational footprint, as well as by working along the value chain. The roadmap articulates 18 opportunities to contribute to the above SDGs, clustered into five themes: food, water, people and health, energy and infrastructure and cities, also noting cross-cutting factors such as human rights, a low-carbon economy and digitization.

On food, for example, the roadmap outlines three “impact opportunities” around: increasing productivity of the food system; reducing both food waste via better packaging and preventing waste from food packaging; and transforming food additives to combat malnutrition. The publication notes that these contribute to SDGs 2, 9, 12 and 14.

To achieve each of these impact opportunities, the roadmap spells out key actions points and partners needed to deliver the opportunity, whether the chemical sector will need to offer low, medium or high levels of input, and the timeframe for engagement (short-, medium-, or long-term). Further, it defines whether the initiative is a product innovation, process innovation or partnership innovation, noting the SDG targets affected and extent of impact (low, medium, high).

The roadmap also divides chemical manufacturers into five categories: commodities, diversified products, fertilizers and agriculture, industrial gases, and specialty high value-added chemicals. It notes that targeted working groups will be needed to advance the various action points, calling on actors in the industry to leverage the roadmap so that they can bring together collaborators from both within and outside of the sector.

In response, WBCSD pioneered a set of SDG Sector Roadmap Guidelines that can be applied to any industry seeking to develop a roadmap.
The Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap is the first of its kind, piloting WBCSD’s three-step approach as articulated in the general guidelines.
Private sector participants at other HLPF side events noted that the chemical sector is the “industry of industries,” meaning its reach can affect all areas of production.

The report highlights that every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of US$5.50, while every dollar invested in the supply of drinking water returns US$2.

The report’s forward by Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), summarizes 2017 CDP data, which find that, although 71% of companies view tackling water security as a significant opportunity to grow their business, only 49% monitor WASH issues and just 7% have committed to improving WASH access, in line with SDG 6 (the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation).

While WBCSD outlines the existence of WASH issues in global governance frameworks, the report makes an economic case for WASH in the workplace. It points out that lost working days due to poor sanitation resulted in nearly US$4 billion in damages to the global economy. The report encourages companies to sign the WASH Pledge, which contains 32 principles on best practices in the workplace. The Pledge, WBCSD notes, directly contributes to the achievements of SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2, on universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water and access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, respectively.

Lost working days due to poor sanitation resulted in nearly US$4 billion in damages to the global economy.

In terms of follow-through on the Pledge, the report finds that three quarters of signatories have a WASH reporting or tracking mechanism. To track progress, a self-assessment tool enables companies to evaluate performance on workplace water supply, sanitation and hygiene to determine whether or not a facility is compliant with the Pledge. Outlining how the WASH Pledge has been implemented within companies, the report notes that responsibility sits primarily within their health and safety departments (41%), followed by sustainability teams (33%).

On lessons learned since the WASH Pledge’s inception, WBCSD notes that more work is needed. The report recommends that visibility be expanded through national and regional industry networks, that sector-specific guidance be developed, particularly in agriculture, construction and transportation, and that the WASH Pledge and signatories align with national and regional policies and priorities on the issue.

A side event convened by the Government of Switzerland and hosted by UN Global Compact in the margins of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) highlighted the report and further-discussed the social and economic benefits of private sector investments in WASH. It identified barriers to businesses’ implementing WASH solutions, and explored opportunities for collaboration with government entities.

117,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholder-report-measures-up-uk-performance-on-sdgs/,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholder Report 'Measures up' UK Performance on SDGs,"17 July 2018: An event convened in the margins of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) celebrated the launch of the report titled, ‘Measuring Up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’ Organized by UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and hosted by PwC, the discussion reviewed the report’s key findings and methodology.

Bringing together experts from over 100 organizations across the UK, the report offers the first comprehensive review of SDG delivery in the country, covering all 17 Goals and 143 of the 169 targets. Emily Auckland, UKSSD Co-Chair, emphasized that the scope primarily focuses on domestic delivery of the SDGs within the UK, and that the report does not compare the UK to other countries. On the authoring process, she explained that each chapter of ‘Measuring Up’ —the first section of which reviews progress on a Goal-by-Goal basis—was led by one or two UKSSD members, based on their strengths and area of expertise. The report’s second section examines procedural aspects of SDG delivery in the UK, including governance arrangements and the roles of stakeholders.

The report finds that the UK performs well on 24% of the targets, has performance gaps on 57%, and shows little to no policy change or otherwise poor performance on 15%. For 3% of targets, there were not enough data available to make an informed assessment. The report utilized publicly available data from international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank, as well as from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). UKSSD also notes that in authoring the report, they identified data gaps on the UK’s impacts abroad, including through supply chains and on marine pollution. Although accounting for the country’s global reach is embedded in the thinking, UKSSD noted, additional measures are needed take stock to take stock.

Areas of high performance include SDGs 3, 4 and 17. The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15.

Areas of high performance by the UK include SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15 (life on land), and on several Goals (2, 5, 9 and 13) not a single target is marked as green (“good”). In terms of efficiently accelerating progress, the report notes that although the UK’s implementation framework of Single Departmental Plans (SDPs) are a practical way of delegating authority, there is a risk that doing so will reduce recognitions of interlinkages across the Goals and targets, thereby siloing efforts or reduce their effectiveness. Thus, the report calls for cross-departmental action to ensure policy coherence.

Dominic White, Co-Chair, UKSSD, highlighted that the report is put forth in the spirit of collaboration, offered in lieu of government capacity, to recognize what a performance review looks like from a stakeholder perspective. He emphasized synergies between the UK and global contexts, noting that this is “where sustainable development comes home.” On methodology, he underscored the stringency of the review, noting that UKSSD applied the “leave no one behind” principle when analyzing targets: if a person or group is not getting the full benefits of a target, the target is not scored as green.

Looking ahead, White described the ‘Measuring Up’ report and the UK’s intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 HLPF as opening a “policy window” where experiences can be built on and taken further, and gaps identified by the report can be addressed. The discussion also raised the broader importance of “voluntary stakeholder reviews” (VSRs), which can serve as a baseline for, or to complement, inform, strengthen—or in some cases refute—countries’ official VNRs on progress towards the SDGs.

The event follows the report’s initial launch, held at the UK House of Commons on 3 July 2018. The ‘Measuring Up’ project has been supported by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Pearson, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Sodexo, DNV GL, PwC, Stakeholder Forum and Thai Union.

The session marked the Council’s first debate on climate change and security in seven years.

While speakers agreed that climate change and its impacts pose serious threats, they disagreed over the degree to which the Security Council has a responsibility to address climate change, with some arguing that the Council must address climate change as a security risk, and others warning against expanding the Council’s mandate or encroaching on the jurisdiction of other bodies. Some delegates proposed, inter alia, the appointment of a Special Representative on Climate and Security, and the establishment of an “institutional home” or hub for climate and security‑related issues within the UN system.

During the event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed described climate change as “one of a web of factors that can lead to conflict.” She warned that countries most vulnerable to drought and crop failure are also those most vulnerable to conflict and fragility. Mohammed cited the UN Secretary-General’s forthcoming report, which highlights the climate-security nexus in West Africa and the Sahel, and said the UN’s climate‑related security risk assessments and management strategies have increased.

Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of Nauru, on behalf of the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS), said a Special Representative on Climate and Security could facilitate regional and cross‑border cooperation on issues affected by climate change and support post-conflict situations when climate change is a risk factor.

The Russian Federation expressed concern over efforts to link environmental conservation to international peace and security, warning that the Council lacks “the expertise or the mechanisms” to effectively counter climate change effects. He said climate change should be addressed within national borders and under the appropriate UN agencies and departments.

France said discussing climate change in the Security Council in no way undermines the Paris Agreement on climate change. Maldives, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said the UNFCCC must remain the primary UN agency to respond to climate change.

Sudan, on behalf of the Arab Group, said, while the Council has an important role to play in addressing the climate-conflict nexus, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) are also important players. He said Arab governments are incorporating climate issues into their efforts to achieve the SDGs.

The UK highlighted her country’s US$7.7 billion international climate finance commitment.

Speakers also noted, inter alia, that: rising temperatures exacerbate other threats and risks, making implementation of the SDGs impossible; climate change impacts can create fertile ground for the activities of extremist groups and terrorists; and an estimated 720 million people are at risk of being pushed into poverty by 2050 by climate change. They underscored the outcomes of a recent African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council (PSC) debate on the nexus between climate change and conflict.

Speakers also raised issues related to the Council: ensuring greater analytic capability for risk assessments, conflict analysis and early warning; encouraging conflict- and climate-sensitive prevention and development efforts; encouraging the UN Secretary-General to include climate‑related risks in his reports to the Council; strengthening and harmonizing coordination with UN bodies and agencies charged with addressing climate change; and convening regular discussions on climate change and security.

119,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-paper-tests-methodology-for-prioritizing-sdgs-indicators/,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"World Bank Paper Tests Methodology for Prioritizing SDGs, Indicators","June 2018: The Office of the World Bank Group’s Senior Vice President for 2030 Agenda, UN Relations and Partnerships has outlined a methodology for helping policy makers to prioritize SDG targets in their development plans. The authors argue that how a country will perform on a specific SDG indicator is dependent on progress on other SDGs, and they introduce the concepts of “SDG proximity,” “SDG centrality” and “SDG density” to consider specific indicators.



The Policy Research Working Paper titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals Diagnostics An Application of Network Theory and Complexity Measures to Set Country Priorities,’ uses a database on SDG progress, constructed using data from the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG‐SDGs), the World Bank’s SDG database (WB‐SDGs), and additional external data. The database includes the majority of “Tier 1” indicators, as categorized by the IAEG-SDGs.

The authors posit that “if a set of positive development outcomes are observed frequently coexisting across countries, then there are strong commonalities” in their underlying delivery mechanisms. The methodology considers 1) country capacities such as skills, infrastructure, technology, institutions and natural resources; 2) countries’ SDG delivery mechanisms, whether intentionally or unintentionally created; and 3) the resulting observable development outcomes.

The authors note that the extent to which capacities can be used between SDGs is dependent on their proximity to one another. They define “SDG proximity” as the conditional probability of two indicators being “successful” together, a function of the commonalities shared. For example, the indicator “number of physicians per 1,000 people” is likely to have more commonalities with—and be closer in proximity to—an indicator to measure malnutrition than it would with one on marine protected areas.

If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with many “proximities,” the country is likely to also achieve progress in others.

The sum of a Goal’s proximities provides its measure of “SDG centrality,” the paper explains. If a country performs well on a Goal or indicator with high centrality, the country is likely to also achieve progress in others. SDGs 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 6 (clean water and sanitation) are calculated to be the most “central,” while Goals 1 (no poverty) and 13 (climate action) are calculated to be the least central.

The highest-ranked indicators in terms of centrality relate to access to electricity, and populations using improved drinking water sources. The least central indicators address varied themes, including gender parity, disaster risk reduction strategies, education, time spent on unpaid domestic work, employment in agriculture, malaria incidence rates, and the number of breeds classified as being not-at-risk of extinction, among others. However, the authors caution against “writing off” an SDG or indicator as irrelevant simply because it features limited connections.

To prioritize actions, the authors cite the importance of an SDG’s “density” in a country. This is defined on the basis of the Goal’s proximities to others in which the country is successful. It will be easier to make progress on a high-density SDG than a low-density SDG. The paper suggests that governments can use the concepts of SDG proximity, centrality and density to redeploy SDG delivery mechanisms or other capacities, in order to maximize impact.

The authors highlight that other recent work also focuses on SDG interconnectedness, the probability of over-performing on a specific target given progress on others, and whether achievement of some targets promotes or accelerates progress on others. These include recent efforts by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), David Le Blanc for the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), and implementation of the Country Development Diagnostics Framework.

Several countries and organizations outlined examples of SIDS partnerships and initiatives they launched. Many also called for: predictability and continuity of SIDS support; ensuring monitoring and accountability of partnerships at the global and national levels; and strengthening capacity building, including on resource mobilization.

The annual Global Multi-Stakeholder SIDS Partnership Dialogue is one component of the SIDS Partnership Framework established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) following the Third International Conference on SIDS, held in Samoa in 2014. The Dialogue provides a global platform for SIDS and partners to review progress of existing partnerships for SIDS, launch new partnerships, and allow stakeholders to exchange lessons learned and identify good practices. The 2018 Dialogue took place at the UN Headquarters in New York, US, in parallel with the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing the meeting on 12 July 2018, Peter Thomson, Ambassador and UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that the UN Ocean Conference in June 2017 resulted in over 1,400 voluntary commitments to advance implementation of SDG 14 (Life below water), and a large number of these commitments were announced by SIDS countries. He remarked that the financial sector is “getting on board” and many governments are being more active than before on the oceans Goal He added that multilateralism is more needed than ever, and genuine and durable partnerships are “the best way forward.”

François Martel, Secretary-General, Pacific Islands Development Forum, said partnerships need to focus more on community resilience, and remarked that most of the best partnerships come from islands and are replicable. Simona Marinescu, UN Resident Coordinator and UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Samoa, stressed the importance of internal partnerships within the SIDS, and noted the need for relevance, respect for sovereignty, commonality and additionality, and political consensus for meaningful partnerships.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative for the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and SIDS, remarked that recurrent natural disasters in SIDS countries make it difficult to attract financing, and indicated that the 2018 SIDS Global Business Network Forum in Mauritius, convened by the UN Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) together with the government of Mauritius, was the third in a series of SIDS private sector partnership fora launched by UN-OHRLLS and its partners. She noted that the one-day high-level review of progress on the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway scheduled for September 2019 will be an opportunity to assess progress and consider priorities for action in the coming years.

Elliott Harris, Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Chief Economist, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) noted that preparations for the 2019 high-level review are already underway. He noted that DESA, with the funding support provided by Italy, is undertaking a project to increase stakeholder capacity to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Samoa Pathway in line with the high-level review preparatory process.

Among other initiatives, Aliioaiga Feturi Elisaia, Permanent Representative of Samoa, noted that the Pacific Resilience Fund seeks to provide resources to South Pacific communities to invest in their resilience to climate change. Saud Al Shamsi, Deputy Permanent Representative of United Arab Emirates (UAE), outlined the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund (UAE-PPF), and the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund (UAE-CREF), two funds of US$50 million each, for renewable energy projects in Pacific Island nations and Caribbean countries. He called on SIDS to consider forecast-based financing, an innovative mechanism where early preparedness and community-level actions are pre-planned based on credible forecasts, and are funded and implemented before disasters strike.

Ahmed’ Abdel-Latif, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) noted that sustainable energy is a key area for SIDS partnerships, and underlined the success of the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative, that seeks to bring together SIDS and partners to promote the accelerated deployment of renewables on islands. He also reported that 20 SIDS adopted national energy roadmaps to support their transition to renewable energy. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) provided several examples of partnerships it carried out with the SIDS, and said it is planning to revive the University Consortium of Small Island States (UCSIS) together with DESA and other partners.

Canada told the SIDS “your challenges are our challenges,” adding her country would invest $162 million to support the goals outlined in the ‘Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities’ issued during the Group of 7 (G7) Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, in June 2018. She also noted that as part of the G7 Presidency, Canada will host a meeting of G7 Environment, Energy and Oceans Ministers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 19-21 September 2018. The meeting will consider the theme ‘Working Together on Climate Change, Oceans and Clean Energy’ and discuss global climate action, clean growth and sustainable finance, resilient coasts and fisheries, plastic pollution, energy security and clean energy.

Norway said: it organized a week-long capacity building workshop for SIDS to prepare for the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) negotiations; it supports a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative to address the health effects of climate change, particularly on SIDS; and has worked to establish a multi-donor trust fund on marine litter and pollution in the World Bank.

New Zealand reported that it is supporting the trust fund established for the SAMOA Pathway high-level review, and that out of seven SIDS partnerships registered on the SIDS Action Platform, three are now completed. He said New Zealand announced an increase in its development cooperation financing, with most of it allocated to SIDS. Australia remarked that it will allocate $1.3 billion to the Pacific region next year. The Russian Federation said it provided humanitarian assistance, financing and other types of support to Vanuatu and other countries that were impacted by hurricanes Irma and Maria, and is working to strengthen capacity to manage natural disasters.

Seychelles noted that it launched Blue Bonds, and asked for support on setting up the enabling environment, the architecture and the mechanisms to establish the partnerships needed to address SIDS challenges. Belize announced it will phase out single-use plastic products by April 2019, and has revised its legislation to better protect its mangroves.

The Dialogue was organized by DESA and OHRLLS, in close consultation with the Steering Committee on Partnerships for SIDS, co-chaired by Belize and Ireland.

Many speakers called for justice, dignity and a human rights-based approach to affordable housing in cities. Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, argued that housing (SDG target 11.1) is the most significant issue facing cities today, and highlighted the injustice of development that destroys urban neighborhoods and displaces residents.

Marc Pecsteen, Permanent Representative of Belgium and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), chaired the session reviewing SDG 11. Discussions drew on the joint report by UN-Habitat and partner agencies, released on 9 July, which outlined global progress and challenges for sustainable cities. The report titled, ‘SDG 11 Synthesis Report: Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ presents UN agencies’ joint position.

Benjamin Rae, Statistics Division, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), stressed that, if States continue to rely on the private sector for housing, then they are obliged to ensure markets provide affordable housing.

Rohit Aggarwala, Columbia University, noted there is no “one size fits all” formula for achieving the various SDG 11 targets, and called for thoughtful and comprehensive management of urban issues and appropriate distribution of powers.

Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, New York City, highlighted that New York is the first city in the world to submit a voluntary local review to the UN, and has declared 11 July to be Global Goals Day in honor of the SDGs. She highlighted commonalities between the SDGs and the OneNYC campaign, including: principles of growth, equity, sustainability and resilience; consultative processes with local agencies, residents and businesses; commitment to leave no one behind; and measurement of progress. Noting that “progress is in fact possible,” she highlighted the city has achieved cleaner air and water, record wage growth, and tripled the number of children accessing quality early childhood education.

Jean Todt, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, observed that urbanization is strongly correlated with the use of motor vehicles. He highlighted the economic and social cost of road accidents, and argued that road safety (SDG target 11.2) should be considered part and parcel of sustainable mobility and transport, citing a combination of necessary policy elements, including affordable public transport and infrastructure for motorized and non-motorized transport.

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, noted that, while the percentage of slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing has decreased, their absolute numbers nevertheless has increased. She defined three key challenges for implementing SDG 11: housing affordability (SDG target 11.1), accessibility and adequacy of housing; management of urban sprawl (SDG target 11.3 on sustainable human settlement planning); and access to public spaces (SDG target 11.7). She added that monitoring progress will depend on having common definitions and units of analysis, and drew attention to UN-Habitat’s National Sample of Cities as a model for aggregating data from different cities within a country so as to discern dominant patterns.

Meera AlShaikh, Project Manager, Smart Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighted the high ecological footprint of urban areas and presented Dubai’s strategies for providing solar energy, increased use of recycled water, and various technologies including blockchain, AI and ICT services to enable Dubai’s transformation as a smart city.

Other speakers emphasized the need for finding new approaches to citizen participation, participatory governance by the urban poor, cities’ connections with rural ecosystems, post-disaster management to “build back better,” and the need to stop gender-based violence.

Many UN Member States, major groups, UN agencies and international organizations made interventions from the floor, highlighting country and programme experiences. Delegates linked improvements in urban spaces to poverty alleviation, and some countries, including Brazil and Sierra Leone, stressed the right to housing as an integral part of sustainable cities. They noted the particular needs of women, persons with disabilities, youth, and elderly persons, and drew attention to conflict as a driver for migrants and refugees moving to cities. Several delegates gave examples of “smart city” approaches that not only promote the use of digital technologies but also increase social inclusion, environmental sustainability and quality of life for urban residents.

Many also cited air quality as an important element of sustainable cities, noting the benefits of electric vehicles for reducing air pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) noted that only 12% of cities meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.

Featuring four panels consisting primarily of chief sustainability officers, the event titled, ‘Business and the SDGs – Accelerating Transformation: Insights from Chief Sustainability Officers & Sustainability Champions,’ addressed how companies are integrating the SDGs into operations, human rights, partnerships and investment towards the Goals.

Opening remarks by Liu Zhenmin, Head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), noted that businesses today operate in a geopolitical context that leaves much to be desired. Filippo Veglio, WBCSD, articulated the role of businesses in achieving the SDGs as: an engine of employment; a developer of technology and innovation; and a source of finance. Veglio described the implications of the SDGs for businesses, recalling the CEO Guide to the SDGs and SDG Compass, and highlighted the results of a joint survey of WBCSD members conducted with DNV GL.

In a panel on strategic integration of the SDGs into business practices, panelists highlighted challenges and solutions regarding the complexity of the SDGs and opportunities for impact. Approaches their companies have taken include “retrofitting” existing strategies to fit the SDGs, changing corporate governance structures and launching new sustainability initiatives. One difficulty, they noted, has been balancing the possible tension between generating short-term returns and creating long-term shared value. Doing so demands winning buy-in both internally and externally. Participants reported that they have had to engage buyers and other stakeholders as well as senior management teams and CEOs. Panelists also emphasized the importance of robust measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs), which, they noted, can not only demonstrate a company’s impact, but also align multiple levels of internal management.

Businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing they need to go further on freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing.

Another panel addressed corporate respect for human rights as a key vehicle through which business can contribute to sustainable development. Moderated by Caroline Rees, President and Co-founder of Shift, the discussion articulated how large companies work to uphold human rights throughout their operations and supply chains. Rees outlined the current state of play, noting that businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing the need to go further on others such as freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing. Describing the three pillars of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights, she noted a recent mapping of human rights to the SDGs, and flagged a new Shift report that features 15 case studies on the human rights opportunity for business, linked to the SDGs.

Participants took the discussion further, noting that human rights go beyond SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Andrew Petersen, Sustainable Business Australia (SBA), flagged that SDGs 5 (gender equality) and 10 (reduced inequalities) hit closest to home for SBA’s membership. Tony Henshaw, Aditya Birla Group, said that after the Group signed the WASH Pledge, it realized they needed to do more in the area of water, sanitation and hygiene: “we were 600 bathrooms short.” Tim Fleming, AT&T, noted the enabling power of technology in improving outcomes towards the SDGs, flagging a new Digital Access Index. Panelists also lamented that working across supply chains is difficult, but noted the importance of strict supplier programmes and WBCSD’s Reporting Matters work.

A third panel, on ‘Business as Unusual,’ described how companies can utilize the SDGs to pioneer new forms of collaboration, both at sector- and system-level. Moderator Andrew Wilson, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), argued that the notion of partnerships is overused, and that the private sector partners “for impact.” Unpacking key factors that enable success, participants identified similar characteristics, topics and skills as those which emerged from the HLPF’s Partnership Exchange, including: embracing diversity and differences; simplifying language for communicating between private sector, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media; the ability to build trust; ensuring all stakeholders are present; and the benefits of complementary skill sets to be gained from having partners. Arne Cartridge, Yara International, offered lessons around local ownership aligned with country goals, openness and inclusivity, and a market-driven approach. Michelle Grogg, Cargill, stressed the need for clarity on what partners aim to do together, scalability of projects, a long-term approach, and the need to be innovative, taking risks that go beyond business as usual.

Dominique Debecker, Solvay, described how industries can come together, including through the use of sector roadmaps. These can enhance companies’ license to operate, help them manage risk, and open up new growth markets while setting a common vision, mapping impact on the SDGs, and identifying actions that can be taken in partnership with wider stakeholder groups. Debecker highlighted the release of WBCSD’s Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap, which resulted from multiple workshops involving numerous companies and stakeholders from the industry.

The final panel addressed investor engagement, and how to effectively measure and communicate SDG performance in the face of increasing investor scrutiny. Steve Waygood, Aviva Plc, indicated that failing to deal with SDGs collectively would mean the folding of his business, including because current climate change scenarios represent an existential crisis for the insurance industry. He argued that the “SDGs exist because the market fails”; in other words, if it were already possible to earn money delivering the Goals, governments would not have had to establish the Goals. Bearing this in mind, Waygood stressed that investors do not currently look at how corporates perform on the SDGs because they are externalities, affecting neither companies’ costs nor their revenues. He articulated the need for government-led fiscal measures, market mechanisms, and standards to restructure markets, and noted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance in addition to recent toolkits. The good news, he added, is that investor interest is rapidly increasing.

Timothy Mohin, Chief Executive, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), built on Waygood’s remarks, noting that reporting has been growing, and there is increasing interest from Wall Street in their data. He highlighted a new report titled, ‘In Focus: Addressing Investor Needs in Business Reporting on the SDGs.’ Launched with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and UN Global Compact, the report, he noted, articulates the relevance of the SDGs and the need for a methodology that allows investors to differentiate companies based on their systems for approaching the Goals.

Libby Bernick, Trucost (part of S&P Global), rounded out the panel by underscoring the need for quantitative data. She noted that Trucost is developing a quantitative approach to overlay the SDGs and economic models, and that the rate of change on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments is increasing.

Achievers? Influencers? Leaders?



It’s an incredible list, of incredible women. And they have something in common: members of the G7’s first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council, established by Canada as part of their 2018 G7 presidency, to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment across all areas of the G7’s work.

The Council’s report Make Gender Inequality History is resolute and persuasive. It calls on G7 leaders to take concrete actions to ensure that girls and women are safe, healthy, educated, heard and visible. The recommendations reinforce the SDG goals and targets. One of the priority areas is to deliver comprehensive, women-centered and culturally appropriate health care for all girls, women and gender diverse people. The Council sets out 8 recommendations to achieve ‘gender-responsive health systems [that will] uphold girls’ and women’s essential rights to health, and promote safe, healthy, and functioning societies and strong economic growth and development’. These include Universal Health Coverage (UHC), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), access to quality maternal and newborn health, food security and nutrition, the health needs of girls and women in conflict and humanitarian settings and the meaningful engagement of adolescent girls and young people.

The G7 has recognised the Council’s work and its focus on comprehensive health services for girls and women. In its Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique of 9 June 2018 the G7 has committed ‘to promote and protect women’s and adolescents’ health and well-being’, ‘to supporting strong, sustainable health systems that promote access to quality and affordable healthcare’ and that ‘gender equality is fundamental for the fulfilment of human rights and is a social and economic imperative’. The G7 commitment is welcomed.



Converting commitments into action will depend on one key issue: the role of women as providers of care. Their role as health workers. Women represent the majority of the human resources we have to expand and transform the world’s health systems and fulfill the goals of universal health coverage and sexual reproductive health and rights. In 2016, the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth drew on compelling new evidence that 67% of all health workers are women; nearly seven out of every ten jobs in the health sector. The average in all other labour sectors is 41%. These women, be they managers, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, therapists and numerous other health occupations, are the foundation of health systems and a critical factor in whether we attain comprehensive health services for girls and women. It is these women who are Working for Health. Indeed, the ambition of Universal Health Coverage will be won or lost on how governments and health systems manage people. People need health care. People govern health care. And its people, the health workers – mostly women – that deliver it.","Their role as health workers.

The five winning enterprises focus on eco-inclusive waste management, energy and green technology in Colombia, India, Tanzania and Uganda.

SEED will support the winners with tailored advisory services that help with business and financial plan development, as well as marketing and promotional activities to scale up operations and provide replicable business cases. The winners join a network of more than 230 enterprises from 38 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America who have also received SEED Awards.

Promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development.

The five winning enterprises, selected from a pool of nearly 250 applications, are:

Amazóniko, which focuses on green technologies in Colombia, offers a collaborative recycling web application that motivates users to recycle through a door-to-door collection service and rewards scheme. The programme helps formalize recyclables collection in collaboration with workers, and provides sustainable employment to the waste management sector. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production).

Corporación Acción Semilla, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Colombia, collects organic waste from the food service industry and landscaping services, and converts it into fertilizer for the agricultural activities of local smallholder farms. The enterprise charges clients a fee, and earns profits from the sale of crops and compost. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8, 12 and 13 (climate action).

Daily Dump, which focuses on waste and sanitation in India, enables urban households, communities and businesses to segregate and compost their waste, and increases awareness and responsibility for decentralized resource consumption and disposal. It contributes to implementation of SDGs 11, 12 and 13.

EcoAct Tanzania, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Tanzania, uses environmentally friendly, energy-efficient plastic extrusion to upcycle plastic waste into durable, affordable plastic timbers for construction. The enterprise mitigates climate change by reducing plastic pollution, wood dependence and deforestation, and contributes to SDGs 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 and 13.

Khainza Energy, which addresses energy in Uganda, produces methane from organic waste secured from farms and households, and distributes it in affordable, recyclable cylinders along with cooking appliances. Khainza Energy incorporates local women, farmers and youth along distribution channels, creating value for consumers and local communities. This project contributes to implementation of SDGs 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 12.

The 2018 SEED Low Carbon Awards are supported by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU). SEED is based on the premise that promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development. The initiative recognizes innovative, inclusive and environmentally friendly start-ups in developing countries, provides them with business know-how support, and profiles them to encourage growth and sharing of experiences.

126,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholders-share-views-on-hlpf-effectiveness-ahead-of-2019-review/,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholders Share Views on HLPF Effectiveness Ahead of 2019 Review,"9 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants exchanged views on the value, role and future of the HLPF, including an upcoming process to review its format and organizational aspects. The side event titled, ‘Stakeholder Engagement in the HLPF and its Review in 2019,’ was organized by the Major Groups and Other Stakeholder (MGOS), and took place on the first day of the HLPF.

Opening the event, Jeffery Huffines, CIVICUS, noted that in 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and another one at the level of the UNGA. In addition, beginning in September 2019, he said governments will begin a process of reviewing the HLPF’s format and organizational aspects.

The HLPF was established in 2013, through UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 67/290, in accordance with paragraph 84 of ‘The Future We Want,’ the outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Resolution 67/290 was followed by the adoption of UNGA resolution 70/299 in July 2016 that clarifies various elements related to the follow-up and review functions of the HLPF, including the specific themes of the Forum for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as the set of SDGs to be reviewed in depth in those years. Resolution 70/299 also notes that progress in its implementation and in the implementation of UNGA resolution 67/290 will be reviewed by the UNGA at its 74th session (2019-2020) “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.

In the context of this upcoming review process, panelists at the side event highlighted concerns and suggestions with regard to MGOS participation in the HLPF. Stefano Prato, Society for International Development, noted that despite a “significant shrinking” of space for civic engagement, there is capacity to “bridge democratic and bureaucratic deficit.” He called on MGOS to take concrete steps to ensure the participation of “right-holders” (such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, migrants and refugees), in the Forum. He also called on MGOS to “connect the dots” by linking engagement mechanisms between various thematic platforms, such as financing for development (FfD) or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). He underlined the need to better organize, engage more closely with the regional level, and change the nature of the HLPF in a way that allows taking “collective” decisions on issues that need to be addressed.

Mohammed Ali Loutfy, Disabled Peoples International (DPI), said: coalitions composed of civil society and stakeholders should be better supported and recognized as part of SDG reviews; more stakeholders should be involved in SDG implementation at the national level; and there should be increased engagement with local authorities and grassroot groups, and improved coordination between UN agencies and civil society. He called for bringing different participatory processes together, and suggested to have stakeholders represented in the office(s) in charge of SDG implementation at the national level.

Beisheim noted that the thematic reviews lack guidelines, have difficult-to-follow preparatory processes, and lack actionable results.

Marianne Beisheim, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, characterized the HLPF as “the institutional home” of the SDGs, recalling that one of its roles is to follow up on and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. She said there are complementary components of the follow-up and review process, such as the thematic reviews, regional reviews, voluntary national reviews (VNRs), the SDG progress report issued by the UN Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). On issues with the thematic reviews, she noted, inter alia, the absence of guidelines, the difficulty to follow preparatory processes, and the lack of actionable results. On VNRs, she remarked that quality of national preparatory processes and reports vary, national reviews often lack analysis of good practices and challenges, and there is limited room for critical questions from MGOS. She underlined the limited time for in-depth discussions at the HLPF, and the need to secure actionable results for both the thematic reviews and the VNRs.

Among other suggestions, Beisheim called for guidelines and for including policy recommendations from thematic reviews and VNRs in HLPF outcome documents. She also proposed that designated custodian institutions publish a roadmap on preparatory and follow-up process for thematic reviews “in good time,” and that the HLPF makes more room for debates related to VNRs.

Rebecca Malay, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, GCAP, noted that most thematic reviews and VNRs do not frame the SDGs based on a human rights approach. She remarked that the SDG indicators are often “confined” to technocrats, without civil society involvement. She also observed that the many independent reports prepared by civil society organizations on SDG national implementation (“shadow reports”) are not available on the HLPF’s VNR website.

On lessons learned regarding the HLPF so far, Sachini Perera, International Women’s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW), RESURJ, said the review of the HLPF in 2019 should take into account the ongoing UN reform, and should examine how human rights can be incorporated in the Forum, adding that human rights processes are currently overlooked when assessing SDG progress.

Discussing stakeholder engagement in the HLPF and its review in 2019, Jan-Gustav Strandenaes, Stakeholder Forum, said paragraph 15 of resolution 67/290 defines civil society’s rights and privileges at the HLPF. This paragraph allows MGOS to: attend all official meetings of the forum; have access to all official information and documents; intervene in official meetings; submit documents and present written and oral contributions; make recommendations; and organize side events and round tables, in cooperation with UN Member States and the UN Secretariat. Compared to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that preceded the establishment of the HLPF, however, Strandenaes noted that some privileges have been lost, including the access and participation to all negotiations, access to all rooms and participation in all meetings, and access to all delegates on the floor. He also underscored the “enormous” mandate of the HLPF, as defined in resolution 67/290 and the 2030 Agenda, and identified elements that should be improved, including on emerging issues, the science-policy interface, stakeholder engagement, and on developing and negotiating the Ministerial Declaration.

127,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/carbon-floor-pricing-can-discourse-improve-carbon-markets/,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Carbon Floor Pricing: Can Discourse Improve Carbon Markets?,"3 July 2018: Economists have characterized the carbon market as a mechanism that coordinates “promises of non-delivery of an invisible resource to no one,” noting that creating effective markets is challenged by numerous risks of market failure. Even non-economists can gather from this statement that creating an efficient market-based mechanism to determine a price on carbon is no easy task. While many emissions trading schemes (ETS) that have been implemented around the world over the last decade are proof that market-based pricing mechanisms can work, they have also revealed that concerns about their effectiveness in providing a long-term incentive to invest in climate mitigation were well founded.

One such concern is that an ETS may result in a price that is too low or too volatile to act as a meaningful incentive. The EU ETS has often been cited as an example of this problem with critics noting that the average price that resulted in past years is not meaningful to nudge large emitters into accelerated mitigation action. This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

Is a Minimum Price on Carbon Desirable?

To address concerns around the effectiveness of the EU ETS, some EU Member States are considering introducing additional measures, such as an EU-wide or national carbon pricing floors (CPFs) that would guarantee a minimum price on carbon emissions for all market participants.

Germany and France for example agreed, in a Joint Declaration on further cooperation in Europe, to develop an ‘EU Strategy 2050’ for the long-term transformation towards carbon neutrality. The countries propose a high-level ministerial working group on climate change to build a common view on the energy transition as well as tools for triggering sustainable finance and economic incentives, including carbon pricing issues. [German Government Press Release: Meseberg Declaration – Renewing Europe’s promises of security and prosperity]

CPFs that apply to an entire ETS have been implemented using various mechanisms, including:

an auction reserve price that creates a minimum price below which a government withholds a number of allowances from sale;

a top-up payment or carbon price that is designed either as a tax that makes up the difference between the CPF level and the ETS allowance price or as a fixed price which is added to it;

or a system of permit buybacks, where the market operator commits to buying back permits at the floor price.

A key question for regional markets, such as the EU ETS, is whether national and regional prices can coexist. Under a national carbon floor pricing mechanism, a country would be allowed to set a minimum price for emissions that may or may not be higher than the supra-national ETS market price. Several institutions have recently published opposing views on this question.

Yes, if the Conditions are Right.

A study by the Cambridge Energy Research Group entitled “When is carbon pricing desirable?” supports the introduction of an EU-wide power sector CPF. The paper recommends that such a CPF be designed as a carbon levy to “top up” the European Emission Allowances (EUA) price to €25–30/tCO2, rising at 3–5% annually above the rate of inflation, at least until 2030.

The authors argue that this approach would not only address the risk of a “too low” carbon price, but also provide longer-term prices and bring forward low-carbon investment by guaranteeing a minimum return to emissions reductions. They further suggest the delivery of climate benefits through a CPF would be enhanced by the new market stability reserve (MSR) of the EU ETS. The MSR, which will begin to operate in January 2019, will withhold from the market 24% of the calculated EUA oversupply each year from 2019-2023, and 12% of the surplus each year thereafter. From 2023, if the MSR volume exceeds the EUA volume auctioned in the previous year, this excess will be ‘invalidated’ or removed from the MSR. This cancellation mechanism is expected to remove a substantial number of EUAs.

The research group also recognizes that national CPFs are easier to implement than an EU-wide CPF, but notes they pose the risk of intra-EU trade distortions. In addition, a national CPF may need to be accompanied by an emissions performance standard to enhance durability. [Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group Paper “When is carbon pricing desirable?”]

No, because it Increases Costs and Risks of Carbon Leakage

Taking a contrasting view, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) called on EU Member States to refrain from introducing national CPFs or taxes. Focusing on several industry sectors in addition to the power sector, IETA cautions such measures would lead to competitive distortions, negatively impact industrial low carbon investment strategies and reduce the EU ETS’s efficiency. The authors emphasize the risk of carbon leakage from the country imposing the national mechanism and the risk of creating a barrier to linking with ETS in other jurisdictions. They suggest instead of introducing additional taxes, Member States should assess the potential to extend coverage of the EU ETS to additional sectors and gases.

If Member States do decide to introduce additional carbon price measures, IETA recommends such measures be temporary, arguing that the system absorbs accumulated surplus through the MSR. They advise member states: ensure a high degree of coordination to minimize market distortions and fragmentation; transparently quantify their impact in terms of emission reductions within the scope of the EU ETS; and voluntarily cancel an adequate amount of allowances from their auction volumes in order to mitigate the impact of the measure on the functioning of the EU ETS. [IETA Position Paper]

Healthy Discourse Contributes to Improvements of Carbon Markets

These diverging positions on CPFs show that fixing the shortcomings of current carbon market mechanisms won’t be easy. On the other hand, the debate is also proof that both sides share an interest in improving the effectiveness of the EU ETS. In medicine, treatments are reviewed for improvements, and where such are not observed other treatments, including in combination, are tried aiming at increasing effectiveness and success. In a similar way, policy debates around measures to address climate change often reveal diverging views and heterogeneous preferences of experts and governments. While coming to an agreement may take some time, the commitment to a healthy, evidence-based debate is an encouraging sign that carbon mechanisms are maturing into an effective tool that will ultimately overcome the barriers predicted by economists.","This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

Japanese Governmental Efforts toward the SDGs and 'SDGs Future Cities'

In response to the United Nations' adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the Japanese government established a cabinet body, the SDGs Promotion Headquarters (below, ""the Headquarters"") in May 2016. Headed by the Prime Minister and composed of all of Japan's ministers of state, the Headquarters meets semiannually to ensure a whole-government approach to achieving the SDGs effectively.

In the SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles spelled out by the Headquarters, Japan's vision is to ""Become a leader toward a future where economic, social and environmental improvements are attained in an integrated, sustainable and resilient manner while leaving no one behind."" The Japanese government has identified eight priority areas out of the 17 SDGs.

Empowerment of all people Achievement of good health and longevity Creating growth markets, revitalizing rural areas, and promoting science, technology and innovation Sustainable and resilient land use, promoting quality infrastructure Energy conservation, renewable energy, climate change countermeasures, and sound material-cycle society Conservation of the environment, including biodiversity, forests and the oceans Achieving peaceful, safe and secure societies Strengthening the means and frameworks for the implementation of the SDGs

The SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles also indicate the following three directions of Japan's SDG models to transform companies, regional communities and society through promotion of the SDGs and thereby achieve economic growth and spread it further to the rest of the world.

Promotion of Society 5.0, which is interlocked with the SDGs Regional vitalization driven by the SDGs and creation of resilient, environmentally friendly, attractive communities Empowerment of future generations and women to bear responsibility for the SDGs

Japan faces many problems, including aging and depopulation, especially in rural areas, so regional revitalization has become a key word. In line with this, as a project for local government SDG promotion toward regional revitalization, the national government is inviting local governments to propose projects for achieving the SDGs. It is also selecting local governments that have proposed excellent projects as SDGs Future Cities, with strong support from a taskforce of ministries and agencies involved in local government SDG promotion.

On June 15, 2018, the Cabinet Office announced that 29 local governments had been selected as SDGs Future Cities.

Niseko in Hokkaido; Shimokawa in Hokkaido; Kanagawa Prefecture; Yokohama in Kanagawa; Kamakura in Kanagawa; Toyama City in Toyama; Maniwa in Okayama; Kitakyushu in Fukuoka; Iki in Nagasaki; and Oguni in Kumamoto.

To commend companies and other organizations for their excellent efforts to contribute toward achieving the SDGs, the Headquarters established the Japan SDGs Awards. Shimokawa in Hokkaido handily won the Prime Minister Award at the 1st Japan SDGs Awards, announced in December 2017.

SDG-Based Community Building in Shimokawa

Shimokawa, Hokkaido, where I have been helping with community building since last year, is one of the leading SDGs local governments in Japan; it has not only won an SDGs Award but has also been selected as a SDGs Future City and a project proposed by the town has been selected as a Local Government SDGs Model Project.

The town of Shimokawa is located in the central northern part of Hokkaido, and has a population of about 3,300 in an area of 644.2 square kilometers -- almost same as the total area of Tokyo's 23 wards. With about 90 percent of it forested, the town's main industries are forestry and agriculture. Situated in a heavy snowfall area, where the temperature drops to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius in winter, Shimokawa has produced many ski jumpers, including the legendary Noriaki Kasai.

The town was selected as an Eco-Model City and a Future City (two environmental city programs run by the Japanese government) in the past and has been acclaimed for its continuous efforts in proactive town development. In recent years, an increasing number of people have relocated there from urban areas, putting a brake on depopulation, which would have worsened otherwise. Its path from the beginning, however, has not been that smooth.

After being settled in 1901, Shimokawa's population increased as agriculture, forestry and mining were developed and railway service started in the area. In 1949, the municipality's status changed from ""village"" to ""town."" Though its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1960, soon afterward it started to decrease due to declines in its main industries (agriculture, forestry and mining). Railway service was discontinued, further accelerating the town's depopulation (to about 3,300 currently).

""We cannot just let it happen!"" ""We should do something!"" The town residents, sharing a sense of crisis, began working hard to carry out various projects, drawing on their creativity. Thanks to their efforts, Shimokawa has become an exciting, energetic, attractive town that I always look forward to visiting.

Yet the town people still face a sense of crisis, saying, ""We have to keep moving forward; otherwise we will spiral into decline."" Out of this sense of crisis, the town is trying to pursue town development more proactively. Specifically, as of 2018, the town has been pushing forward with improved town development for the two years since 2017 by integrating the SDGs in the formulation process of its Comprehensive Plan, the town's highest level plan.

In September 2017, the ""SDGs Future City Task Force"" was established within the Shimokawa Town Comprehensive Plan Council. This task force, consisting of ten resident committee members and town officials, has served as a base organization for the process of creating a vision of Shimokawa in 2030 and formalizing that vision. I helped design and facilitate the process.

The specific process was as follows: First we used ""backcasting,"" an approach for considering ""how you want to be at a particular time in the future,"" setting aside current realities and all restrictions, to create a vision of the town in 2030. Next, we used ""system thinking,"" an approach for creating real transformations by understanding the links and interactions among various factors that can produce positive cycles to help the town realize its vision. Then, the task force went to work to come up with concrete measures and projects that would actually produce positive cycles. The task force met 13 times in total during the period from September 2017 to April 2018.

The process was made as open as possible, and this more than anything else came to characterize Shimokawa's vision creation work. In this type of work, the conventional approach would have been to involve only town officials and a few of the town's resident in creating the vision. Instead, the task force members, who are town residents themselves, organized a meeting to write public comments together with other residents after explaining the vision they had created. They later organized another meeting to present the vision they had finalized after incorporating the public comments.

In the course of this half-year process, each task force member was assigned individual ""homework."" They had to identify people who had not been present but were important for the future of this town, interview them to learn about their visions for the town, and consider the matter further based on the results gathered from other members. In addition, a morning ""girls meeting"" was organized to collect opinions about town development and current issues from mothers who were busy taking care of children and could not attend evening meetings. Study sessions for the town council members on the SDGs and community building were also held a full three times.

In this way, through a careful process of consideration, Shimokawa has set seven goals for what it wants to become:

(1) A town where citizens continue striving together -- embodying the town's own values, such as the fortitude to keep facing crisis and hardship, as well as broad-mindedness and tolerance for embracing diverse people and values

(2) A town where nobody is left behind -- enabling all of its citizens to continue to expand their possibilities, have a place where they belong, and play a role so as to live a healthy and meaningful life

(3) A town where humans, resources, and money are cycled in a sustainable manner -- becoming independent and autonomous by achieving the following: an enduring cycle and perpetuation of humans, natural resources (e.g., forests and water) and money; further growth of agriculture, forestry and other industries; and local production of food, wood, energy, etc. for local consumption

(4) A town where citizens can care for each other like a family -- enabling its citizens to continue to live safely with peace of mind by placing importance on developing human-to-human relationships, and caring for and supporting each other

(5) A town where culture and resources handed down from generation to generation are esteemed while new value is created -- preserving things that are old but valuable while creating new value -- a practice for which a new popular term was coined recently in Japan: Onkokishin

(6) A town regarded as a role model by other municipalities around the world -- contributing to the achievement of a decarbonized society (under Paris Agreement) and globally sustainable development (under the SDGs) by enhancing and deepening the town's past efforts

(7) A town bringing smiles to children and nurturing happiness for future generations -- caring about all future generations and nurturing them throughout the entire region, so that children can grow cheerfully and freely

In the materials presented for the award, logos indicating goals corresponding to each of the 17 SDGs were attached to each section of the town's goals. What is significant about the SDGs initiative, however, is not classifying players' efforts into one or another of the 17 goals as if they were 17 small boxes and attaching corresponding logos to them. I think what is really important is, first of all, for the local people to visualize a desirable town with a sense of reality and subjectivity, then to check for any missing aspects using the SDGs framework, and finally to perceive the 17 goals not as individualized goals but as goals mutually connected.

Since Shimokawa is an inland town, the local people there are usually not conscious of the ocean. For that reason, initially there were few opinions about Goal 14 (life below water) of the SDGs. Later, though, they began thinking about the links between the forest, their lives and the ocean, and expressing various opinions about them. In this way, providing awareness of ""links"" that people usually do not consider may be one way utilizing the SDGs framework can be effective.

As mentioned above, the town provides opportunities for considering how the SDGs relate to oneself not only to the task force members but also to people in a variety of positions, helping create broader perspectives. For instance, several members of the town council asked questions regarding the SDGs at a recent general inquiry session. Also, a routine test at the town's junior high school included questions on the SDGs. This is wonderful, isn't it!

The town identifies the following four aspects as advantages of incorporating the SDGs into its comprehensive town development plan, and intends to use them as a tool for its future development.

Discovering or being aware of new challenges by reconsidering the region in light the 17 goals Developing a high-quality approach for community building by looking at the current situation from the perspective of a desirable future, and considering and adopting measures to achieve such a desirable future Establishing a system to develop the town through collaboration with a wide variety of people Communicating the town's attractiveness and potentials within and outside Japan, using the SDGs framework, to boost public perception of the town and attract settlers, visitors, businesses, investment and other involvement in the town

In helping the town develop I came to realize the effectiveness of using the SDGs framework to help even small local towns consider their own community development from a global viewpoint and understand interrelatedness. In view of this, for future community building, backcasting, systems thinking, and the SDGs are certain to be the ""three sacred treasures""!

129,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/why-nigeria-requires-5bn-water-sector-investments-to-meet-sdg-targets/,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vanguard,Why Nigeria requires $5bn water sector investments to meet SDG targets,"Kindly Share This Story:

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

The report titled, ‘Finland and the 2030 Agenda: A follow-up report by CSOs,’ discusses the state of sustainable development in Finland, visions about the future, and recommendations for decision-makers at the global, national and local levels.

The report covers SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12 , 15 and 17. It explains that while the SDGs are linked, some can be at odds with each other, and recommends looking at decisions that are detrimental to sustainable development.

Regarding Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), the report notes interlinkages with, among others, SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), as investments in water and sanitation can lead to reduced health care costs. It also notes that: Finland’s investments in water sector projects have decreased by more than the cutbacks in development cooperation; water distribution networks are aging; and funding for research is lacking. (Read more on Finland’s aid decline here.) The report recommends that Finland, inter alia:

update its international strategy for the water sector;

promote private sector and local investments in the water sector;

increase international cooperation to strengthen know-how and increase the sector’s attractiveness;

ensure the sustainable use of existing water resources;

invest in more efficient water consumption, wastewater management, recycling and reuse technologies, and education and research; and

on the part of municipalities and regional governments, inform residents about water stewardship.

Regarding SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report notes that: Finland’s energy production is largely based on fossil fuels; the country’s fossil fuel consumption per person is more than European and global averages; and one in ten species in Finland is endangered. Globally, the report recommends that Finland: ensure an ecologically sustainable and fair energy system that functions without fossil fuels; join the Eradicating Ecocide initiative and, when necessary, criminalize conspicuous consumption; and from 2020, contribute annually to international climate funding by at least €200 million, particularly for least developed countries (LDCs).

Nationally, the report suggests that Finland set binding energy targets; harmonize licensing practices; and ban fossil energy production by 2030 and stop coal and peat use by 2025. Locally, the report calls on municipalities and provinces to: stop using coal and peat in energy produc­tion plants; begin using wood-based solutions; improve energy efficiency through economic incentives; and introduce demand-side man­agement in buildings owned by municipalities and provinces.

Regarding SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), the report recommends that, globally, Finland should: initiate a programme for “reciprocal sustainable urban development”; ensure that business activities in cities in developing countries support the well-being of residents and the environment; and encouraging less consumption, such as through a voluntary carbon tax.

Nationally, the report recommends that Finland use taxation reform to support and fund local circular and sharing economy through taxation reform. It also suggests considering expenses that future generations will have to bear when making public purchases. Local recommendations include restricting the construction sector’s ability to affect municipal decision-making.

Regarding SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report recommends that Finland: oblige companies to map and reduce negative impacts on human rights impacts; promote the international treaty on corporate human rights responsibilities; strengthen tax justice in Finland and the EU by requiring reporting from multinational corporations; and ensure development cooperation funds are in line with the Paris Agree­ment’s 1.5°C target.

The report explains that, by a 2017 law, public organizations can include labor rights, human rights and environmental conditions in their procurement criteria. Thus, it recommends: developing indicators that describe human well-being and the environment for monitoring state policies and budgets; making responsi­ble procurement decisions in public institutions; and halting the exploitation of child labor and forced labor from procurement chains.

Of relevance to SDG 15 (life on land), intensive forestry is threatening forest species in Finland; around 36% of threatened species live primarily in forest, and 70% of forest habitat types are threatened. However, only about 5.7% of actual forests, or productive forestland, is legally protected from logging, and the government aims to increase logging by 20%. In light of this, recommendations include:

protecting at least 17% of Finland’s forest area;

demanding corporate accountability to stop biodiversity loss;

advocating for a higher level of carbon emission targeting in the EU;

advancing activities that enhance ecosystems’ carbon sinks and storages;

halting support for peatland draining;

shifting municipal management of commercial forests to forestry without clear cutting; and

helping schools, daycare centers and educational institutions diversify learning environments and include environmental education.

Regarding SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), the report calls for: increasing funding of civil society actors to 15% of Finland’s development cooperation; strengthening the UN’s role in international tax-related cooperation, and ensuring all countries can participate in tax system renovation; increasing Finland’s international climate funding to €200 million a year by 2020; and reinvesting carbon trade income in international development and climate funding.

Nationally, the report recommends: using the SDGs as a basis for government programming and budgeting; improving data collection and monitoring to better determine progress regarding sustainable development; and exe­cuting the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to make aggressive tax planning illegal. Local-level recommendations include: organizing an application procedure for annual grants for environmental education and information; increasing financing of associations and citizens’ groups; and including guidance on sustainability and social responsibil­ity in procurement instructions.

The authors note that Finland’s Ministry of Finance has initiated a process to assess the national budget from a sustainable development perspective. However, Finland’s budget proposal for 2019 is expected to be estimated mainly from the climate change perspective, focusing on carbon neutrality and resource use, and they recommend widening the planning to cover other sectors.

The report recalls that Finland was one of the first countries to develop a national implementation plan (adopted in 2016 and approved by parliament in February 2017) and to define national indicators required to monitor progress on sustainable development. Finland presented a voluntary national review at the 2016 session of the HLPF, which highlighted its use of 39 national sustainable development indicators to monitor and review status and trends in sustainable development, which would be revised in line with the 2030 Agenda.. Providing an update on progress in 2017, Annika Lindblom, Secretary-General, Finland’s National Commission on Sustainable Development, noted that stakeholders from civil society, business, and the research community were involved in the definition of SDG indicators, and the follow-up and review system is anchored in the eight objectives of the ‘Society’s Commitment.’ The system is composed of ten indicator “baskets,” each of which contains four to five indicators to be updated once a year, based on inputs from authorities and the public. A monitoring platform will be made available on the sustainable development website of the Prime Minister’s office.

The 2018 SDG Index from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Bertelsmann Stiftung assessed Finland as one of the highest-ranking countries on the SDGs, but notes that even those face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs.

Switzerland is one of the 46 countries that presented a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2018 HLPF.

Switzerland’s VNR titled, ‘Switzerland Implements the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Switzerland’s Country Report 2018,’ reflects on efforts to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development and policy coherence for sustainable development, and shares the country’s experience with institutional embedding and partnerships. The VNR states that the country is “already at an advanced stage in achieving various SDGs” and has already fulfilled a number of targets, including SDG target 1.1 on ending extreme poverty, SDG target 2.1 on ending hunger and SDG target 4.1 on ensuring free, compulsory and good quality education for all. Switzerland leads global rankings in areas related to quality of life, a sustainable economy, social cohesion and protection against natural hazards. In addition, the entire population has access to drinking water (SDG 6), the country has a secure energy supply and is increasing its energy efficiency, expanding its use of renewables and reducing use of fossil fuels (SDG 7).

SDG 5 (gender equality) is one of the Federal Council’s priorities, and gender equality, particularly in the family, education and workplace, as well as the right to equal pay for equal work, are enshrined in the Swiss Federal Constitution. Still, the VNR observes that women’s median pay is 15 percent lower than men’s, and violence against women is a problem in Swiss society. Switzerland describes a number of efforts to address these challenges in its VNR.

Switzerland promotes prosperity for all through public education, social security and its growth policy.

Switzerland’s VNR identifies areas where additional efforts are needed to achieve the SDGs. As an illustration, Switzerland’s use of natural resources from within the country is decreasing but Switzerland’s use of natural resources from abroad is “increasing in an unsustainable way,” hindering the country’s progress on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production).

On the principle of leave no one behind (LNOB), Switzerland stresses its commitment to enable disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities, to benefit from the country’s prosperity. Switzerland promotes prosperity for all through public education, social security and its growth policy, among others.

On policy coherence, Switzerland’s VNR recognizes the importance of tackling challenges in a targeted and focused manner, underscoring the importance of addressing them within a framework that exploits synergies and observes the principles of effectiveness and efficiency. Switzerland promotes policy coherence through procedures that ensure high quality legislation that achieves a balance between conflicting interests, fosters synergies across sectors and reconciles national and global perspectives. In addition, Switzerland uses the MONET monitoring system for sustainable development to track the temporal dimension of policy coherence. The VNR recognizes tensions related to: mainstreaming the economic, social and environmental dimensions of innovation; “conflicts of use” among environmental protection, human settlement, energy and transport as well as between work-life balance; trade-offs between national policies and international agreements; and domestic policy spillovers.

Switzerland’s SDG implementation engages all levels of government as well as the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the scientific community. The country implements the 2030 Agenda at the federal, cantonal and communal levels, according to relevant competencies, established division of tasks and the principle of subsidiarity. Many cantons and communities have defined sustainability and coordination mechanisms for sustainable development, and engage in dialogue with the federal government on SDG implementation. An advisory group of non-state actors has identified priority challenges for the country, and provides a platform for dialogue with the federal government on issues related to SDG implementation. In addition, Switzerland’s Parliament is expected to be “more closely involved” in the future. The VNR further emphasizes plans to increase “coordination between areas and actors” and to strengthen multi-stakeholder partnerships for SDG implementation.

In its presentation to the HLPF, Switzerland showcased: the commissioning of an SDG-related baseline assessment; the inclusion of SDGs in existing statistical indicators; a commitment to circular and green economies; and progress needed in sustainable consumption.

134,https://www.devex.com/news/challenges-facing-sdg-2030-deadline-for-safe-water-and-sanitation-93249,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Challenges facing SDG 2030 deadline for safe water and sanitation,"CANBERRA — Under goal six of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments are committed to targets for clean water and sanitation by 2030 — including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the lead up to a High-level Political Forum held at the United Nations in July, which discussed progress and challenges on a range of SDGs, including goal six, WaterAid Australia drew attention to the challenges of achieving the objective.

By analyzing the most recent data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which shows the percentage of the population in each nation with access to basic water and sanitation, WaterAid showed that the goal is unlikely to be achieved by 2030. The current rate of progress will see centuries before universal access to basic water and sanitation is achieved.

Further analysis of the source data, which shows progress achieved on a range of water and sanitation indicators between 2000 and 2015, suggests that only 21 countries are on target to achieve basic water and sanitation services for their entire population. Meanwhile, 68 countries have seen progress on targets decline since 2000.

The 'S word:' Is it time for the sanitation sector to reconsider subsidies? As donors and implementers grapple with how to deal with the world’s looming sanitation crisis, old debates over the use of subsidies are flaring up again. But experts told Devex of an emerging consensus that there is space for subsidies — if deployed in new and smarter ways.

Responding to environmental and political obstacles, as well as the challenges created in getting the last percentage of the population across the line for basic water and sanitation services, are barriers governments are being asked to urgently deal with, to ensure SDG 6 can be achieved.

Which countries are achieving targets?

Of the 21 countries that have achieved, or are on track to achieve, basic water and sanitation access for the entire population, only three countries classified as developed countries are expected to achieve both basic water and sanitation targets — Australia, Estonia, and Portugal.

There are also developing countries that have made major gains between 2000 and 2015, including Laos, Sri Lanka, Tokelau, and Vietnam. Based on the current rate of progress, these countries are expected to provide basic water and sanitation services for the entire population by 2030.

According to the data, Laos has been one of the biggest achievers. In 2000, less than half of the population had access to basic water and just over a quarter of the population had basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 80 percent of the population had access to basic water while almost three-quarters of the population had basic sanitation.

Based on its current rate of progress, Laos is projected to achieve national access to basic water and sanitation by 2024.

Vietnam is another success story according to the data. In 2000, almost a quarter of the population — most of them living in rural areas — were missing out on basic water access, with nearly half without basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 91 percent of the population had access to basic water, putting the country on track to achieve universal basic water access by 2025.

Now, just under 80 percent of the population has access to basic sanitation — with huge gains made in rural Vietnam. By 2028, the country is projected to achieve universal access based on current progress.

Which countries are in decline?

A concerning trend in the data is countries moving backward on access to basic water or sanitation for populations between 2000 and 2015. These include a wide range of nations: Bermuda, Jordan, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Slovenia, and Zimbabwe.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates.” — Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had enabled 36.7 percent of its population to access basic water and 18.7 percent basic sanitation. By 2015, this number had declined to 36.6 percent and 18.6 percent respectively — small declines by percentage but major barriers to achieving universal basic and water access by 2030.

Other countries started 2000 with a major percentage of their population having accessible water and sanitation, only to drop.

In 2000, Nieu, for example, was providing more than 99.2 percent of its population with access to basic water and 100 percent of its population with access to basic sanitation. Fifteen years later they had both declined — basic water coverage declined to 98.2 percent and basic sanitation to 97.8 percent.

In 2004, Nieu was hit by the worst cyclone on its record, Cyclone Heta, which is likely to have played a role in the decline of water and sanitation. This demonstrates the challenges of natural disasters, conflict, and more, in the ability to achieve the 2030 targets.

Where is progress slow?

For other countries, barriers come from two key challenges: Starting from a low base or slow progress in achieving the final percentage points.

Equatorial Guinea’s population coverage of basic water rose from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2015 — an average improvement of 0.05 percent each year. Based on this rate of progress, Equatorial Guinea will achieve national coverage for basic water by 3119.

The challenge for Equatorial Guinea is in rural areas. While water coverage for urban regions is dramatically improving — with total coverage expected to be reached by 2037 in urban areas — coverage is worsening in rural areas, dropping from 39.9 percent coverage in 2000 to 30.5 percent in 2015. For basic sanitation, the entire nation is moving backward.

Why you should care about 'systems' in WASH The focus in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector needs to shift from the number of pumps or latrines built to a more sustainable, systems-wide approach, according to many insiders. Enter Agenda for Change, a coalition of organizations that seek to demonstrate how this can be done through collective action.

Similarly, Eritrea has a long road ahead. Beginning in 2000, data shows just 16.8 percent of the nation had access to basic water and 7.5 percent access to basic sanitation. By 2015, these numbers had improved, increasing to 19.3 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. But this slow rate of improvement projects that basic water will be provided to the entire population by 2507 and basic sanitation by 2374.

For Vanuatu, the rate of progress on water will see the country just miss the 2030 deadline. Vanuatu is projected to achieve national coverage by 2031. Just over half the population had access to appropriate facilities for basic sanitation in 2015, but with an annual progress of 0.2 percent, the country is projected to achieve basic sanitation targets by 3468.

These three nations also face other challenges.

Equatorial Guinea faces political challenges under the dictatorship of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who seized control of the country in a 1979 military coup. Eritrea has faced conflict with neighboring countries, U.N. sanctions, and droughts. And Vanuatu faces the impact of natural disasters, with Cyclone Pam causing widespread devastation in 2015, as well as the high cost of delivering services to the Pacific region.

At the time the data was collected, Puerto Rico was struggling to provide basic services to the last 3 percent of its population, in both water and sanitation. In 2015, basic water coverage had increased from 97.1 percent to 97.1. Yet, because the annual rate of growth averaged 0.003 percent, Puerto Rico was predicted basic national water access by 2773, with basic sanitation predicted by 2443. The data does not take into account the impact of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, on basic water and sanitation availability.

Despite national basic water coverage, 1 percent of Germany’s population has no access to basic sanitation. The country’s slow rate of progress means universal coverage is projected by 3753.

Belgium too struggles with slow progress. While nearly the entire population has access to water now, national basic sanitation is projected to be achieved by 4817.

Addressing the challenges

Achieving universal basic water and sanitation services by 2030 are hampered by a range of local factors. Although projections show the challenging road ahead for water and sanitation, they do not factor in additional challenges — such as future natural disasters, conflicts, and economic crises — have in achieving universal access targets.

Top employers in water, sanitation, and hygiene: A primer 663 million people still don't have access to clean and safe water, and 1 in 3 people don't have a decent toilet. WASH sector NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, and private consultants are all crucial players in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6. Check out this Devex roundup of some of the biggest employers in WASH to find out if any are right for you.

With data at hand showing the gravity of the challenge, it is hoped that better practices might be developed, through planning and policy, to support universal access. By breaking the data down into in rural and urban coverage, it becomes evident where they exist: Commonly in rural areas.

At the conclusion of a High-level Political Forum, former President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council Marie Chatardová spoke on the challenges of water and sanitation coverage.

“We … held extensive discussions on the SDG 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on cities, 12 on sustainable consumption and production, 15 on life on land, and 17 on partnerships,” she said.

“We came up with many recommendations … Those include establishing a ‘blue fund’ to support design and implementation of transboundary water management for SDG 6.”

She highlighted the importance of partnering with the private sector and other new partners to achieve the goals. But whether the outcomes of the High-level Political Forum, including delivery of the proposed blue fund, will achieve significant changes in the projections is yet to be seen.

“For nations to be years off track in meeting the human right to water and sanitation is shocking,” said Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia, prior to the political forum.

“The meeting of ministers at HLPF must result in more than just words of encouragement because we have only 12 years left to keep the promise made to those living without clean water or a decent toilet. Governments must prioritise water, sanitation and hygiene — the basic building blocks of any stable and prosperous community — ensuring proper financing is put in place to build a more sustainable country today and for future generations,” he said.

WaterAid is calling on governments, donors, financial institutions, and the private sector to prioritize financing for water and sanitation and to integrate the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene into strategies for education, health, and nutrition programs globally.

Experts are calling for more investment into research and programs to tackle stigma and barriers surrounding issues of sanitation.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates,” Muller said.

With one child dying every two minutes from diarrhea caused by dirty water, poor sanitation, and bad hygiene, according to WaterAid, more than a quarter of million children will die each year basic water and sanitation targets are not met — a figure unacceptable to both Muller and the objectives of the SDGs.

136,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/political-challenges-in-monitoring-sdg-6/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Political Challenges in Monitoring SDG 6,"Last month, at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, US, a central part of the discussions on achieving and monitoring SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) was the importance of looking at water quality in a broader context. One example is looking at the quality of freshwater in the context of other sectors, in relationship to food security, or the impact on other resources such as soil. This topic will once again be high on the agenda at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden, later this month.

Seeing freshwater quality in a broader context is no doubt important, but what we often forget is that implementing this broader view comes along with significant measurement challenges. At the forefront of these challenges is the difficulty of identifying relevant data and information needs in view of multiple goals, meeting these data and information needs, and interpreting data and information. These challenges involve various interests and require negotiations. In other words, addressing them is a political matter. To meet such challenges, water quality measurement must move beyond being a technical issue addressed by natural scientists alone, and become a topic for inter- and transdisciplinary research teams.

Changing the Scope Means Redefining Measurements, Process, and Use

Let us first have a look at what has to be measured. If we consider multiple goals when measuring water quality, this complicates the process of identifying data and information needs. Before measurement programmes can be set up, the management goal needs to be clear, for example using water in agriculture for energy and/or food production. This is often not the case due to a lack of regulations specifying integrated measurement goals (such as for soil and water management). Developing such regulations requires negotiation processes laden with transaction costs for all relevant actors. Further, even if the goals are clarified, it often remains unclear what types of indicators, data and standards are best suited to efficiently monitor progress in achieving a goal (for instance standards for health-related water quality or lower standards). This leads to the question of whether existing indicators can be used or combined indicators are needed.

Let us assume now we know what has to be measured. The next question would be how we can obtain the relevant data and information. We see here a couple of challenges for meeting these needs. First, one needs many different types of data and information, such as data on the quality of waters, soils, agricultural yields, and human health. Second, such data needs are particularly challenging to meet from the technical point of view, given the high complexity of the social-ecological system. Take, for instance, the impact of fertilizers on the amount of nitrogen in groundwater. This impact depends on various factors such as weather conditions, the cultivated plants or soil characteristics. Such complexity can lead to unforeseen or delayed effects, which complicate measurement programmes even further. Third, even if data are available, information transfer has particularly high requirements, since data are typically dispersed across research groups (e.g. soil and water scientists) and public authorities (e.g. water and agricultural authorities). Sharing data between these entities can be challenging as there is often a lack of communication or trust, or asymmetric power and interests are involved. All this ultimately hinders the establishment of sufficient and inclusive databases.

Let us assume for a moment we can overcome these challenges and have our data at hand. A third challenge then regards their use for a truly integrated assessment of solutions. We assume here that it will be particularly challenging to interpret data and information given multiple baselines of partly conflicting goals. Take, for instance, measuring the amount of nitrogen in soils and water. High amounts of nitrogen can be interpreted in various ways. From a water quality perspective, high amounts are problematic since they lead to the eutrophication of waters; from an agricultural perspective, however, it may also indicate a high production level, leading to economic growth and food security. Understanding such relations requires thinking in new, broader systems that may go beyond traditional check lists of good practices.

Addressing New Challenges in Measurement

While seeing freshwater quality in a broader context seems to be good idea for achieving truly sustainable development, we have to be prepared for increased challenges in the measurement process. These challenges are not only technical, but also political, meaning that they involve political discourses among various stakeholders, reflecting various interests and power asymmetries. New tools based on rigorous research need to be developed to help practitioners overcome such political challenges.

At the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we believe that measurement-related activities should be conducted in a participatory manner from the very start. First, an interdisciplinary research agenda on water quality measurement is the way forward. Measuring water quality has mainly been understood as a natural science endeavor. However, addressing the politics in defining targets, gathering data, and interpreting data calls for the involvement of social scientists. Take, for instance, the question of data sharing. Extensive and successful research conducted by political scientists on the conditions of information sharing in conflict-laden environments can help design water measurement programmes in the face of complex societal goals.

The second step is to deepen existing stakeholder engagement by opening the natural science-dominated field of measurement to the broad range of stakeholders in resource management. Practitioners can be involved here in setting the frame for measurement. (Natural) scientists have to refer to these societal needs when setting up measurement programmes within their research programmes. This can be done, for instance, by discussing measurement challenges together with stakeholders of different ministries in joint workshops.

This article was authored by Sabrina Kirschke and Tamara Avellán, when they were researchers at UNU-FLORES.","At the forefront of these challenges is the difficulty of identifying relevant data and information needs in view of multiple goals, meeting these data and information needs, and interpreting data and information.
To meet such challenges, water quality measurement must move beyond being a technical issue addressed by natural scientists alone, and become a topic for inter- and transdisciplinary research teams.
If we consider multiple goals when measuring water quality, this complicates the process of identifying data and information needs.
New tools based on rigorous research need to be developed to help practitioners overcome such political challenges.
This can be done, for instance, by discussing measurement challenges together with stakeholders of different ministries in joint workshops."

In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

These include engaging businesses to align their operations and investments with the SDGs as well as using tools to ensure good governance and policy coherence, both in-country and through development cooperation.

A high-level meeting on the theme, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ is scheduled for 24 September 2018, where UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to unveil a new private investment strategy. As outlined by Global Policy Watch, the meeting format will include three “Davos-style” panels with CEOs from the private sector, heads of state and technological innovators. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted, during a 27 July briefing on the meeting, that the world is seeing a “waning commitment” to international trade, climate, economic and financial cooperation, and that we need to not only step up engagement with the private sector, but also take advantage of financial and technological innovations to bridge gaps.

On private sector action, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN Global Compact (UNGC) have released a publication titled, ‘A Practical Guide,’ which addresses integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting. The publication follows two previous guidance documents for enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs, and outlines a three-step process to define priority SDG targets, measure and analyze objectives, and “report, integrate and implement change,” while also considering data users’ needs. The publication, developed in collaboration with Shift and PwC, warns against selecting SDGs that are easiest to report on, and instead encourages companies to focus on what is most important—or material—to their business. A more detailed write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub is forthcoming.

Also on business-SDG engagement, an edie article summarizes a webinar featuring experts from BT, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and DNV GL. Held 26 July 2018, the discussion builds on recent reports that find that, although many businesses have made pledges on SDG uptake and implementation, few feature measurable targets related to—or that measure progress against—the Goals. Panelists recognized the need for transparency on businesses’ negative impacts and the importance of identifying them in order to tackle them first. They further noted that the SDGs present an opportunity to move beyond reactive or isolated sustainability actions, and that engaging external actors that are likely to apply pressure has become “business as usual” for them.

A blog on the UN Development Programme (UNDP) website describes how companies are beginning to move beyond a business-as-usual approach. The post describes a “fourth sector” of for-profit entities “whose main purpose is to solve social and environmental problems, but generate their income mainly through commercial activities.” The author, Heerad Sabeti, is CEO of the Fourth Sector Group, which was launched in collaboration with the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress and UNDP, among other partners. Sabeti also highlights progress in South America, offering Natura as an example of a business that is contributing to “virtually every SDG in Brazil.”

On governance, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released a report titled, ‘Governance for Integrated Solutions to Sustainable Development and Climate Change: From linking issues to aligning interests.’ The report’s chapters focus primarily on the Asia-Pacific region, looking at the co-benefits of an integrated approach derived from the alignment of disparate agencies and other stakeholders. The study develops a conceptual model to illustrate which actors should be involved, and looks at horizontal, vertical and multi-stakeholder coordination in the transportation and solid waste management sectors, as well as across the water-energy-food nexus. The authors conclude that in some cases, more engagement is not needed, as the necessary relationships may already exist. However, they note the increasingly important trend of “governance beyond governments,” signaling a need for flexibility in engagement strategies. IGES also recently launched a web tool that enables users to visualize SDG targets’ interactions with others, to help assess synergies and trade-offs and inform decision-making in both the public and private sectors.

Patrick Curran, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, underscores the importance of policy coherence, called for in SDG target 17.14. Curran notes that countries’ development pathways—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa—are highly dependent on the water-energy-food nexus, noting that policies in these sectors are not currently “joined-up.” He emphasizes that reliance on donor support can sometimes undermine coherent policy, as aid has the potential to look at sectors or issues in isolation. To mitigate a siloed approach, Curran calls for the review and update of national development plans, conducted with the support of inter-ministerial and multi-stakeholder committees.

Breaking out of a siloed approach means building multi-actor partnerships (MAPs), as outlined in a German Development Institute (DIE) discussion paper titled, ‘Incentivizing and Regulating Multi-actor Partnerships and Private Sector Engagement in Development Cooperation.’ Authored by Dorothea Wehrmann, the paper describes challenges to engaging private sector actors in development cooperation towards long-term agendas such as the SDGs. Wehrmann looks at the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) to examine how such networks and partnerships can enhance MAPs’ engagement and effectiveness. She finds that these arrangements must: 1) strengthen institutional oversight; 2) support case-specific incentivizing and regulating strategies; and 3) lend further credence to context-specificity, for example, in South-South cooperation. All types of engagement will be critical in the context of reduced UN funding, as highlighted by Devex.

A Brookings report on options for filling the financing void for the SDGs focuses on increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries by increasing engagement with development finance institutions and MDBs.

On development finance more broadly, the Brookings Institution’s George Ingram and Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr. examine ways to raise the US$2.4 trillion needed annually in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030. They outline four options for filling the void, focusing primarily on the fourth: 1) eliminating trade barriers; 2) increasing official development assistance (ODA); 3) mobilizing domestic resources by creating an enabling environment for private investment; and 4) increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by increasing engagement with development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). They compare DFIs in the US, Europe and Asia to offer recommendations that can mobilize additional private capital.

A significant portion of the finance needed is for infrastructure, as discussed in a DIE paper looking primarily at the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS Bank. The paper titled, ‘Mobilizing Capital for Sustainable Infrastructure: The cases of AIIB and NDB,’ reviews instruments to mobilize private capital, building in experiences of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and others to identify lessons for “low-cost” finance providers. Given the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure, the authors note the importance of these DFIs in the sector, especially in the context of long-term sustainable development, as the social and environmental impacts of infrastructure investments are “locked in” for the duration of the projects’ lifetimes. The paper notes a need to increase the attractiveness of more sustainable projects, including by boosting returns through blended finance, de-risking through co-finance or other guarantees, and through specialized instruments used by the EIB and International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Regardless of whether they focus on public or private sectors, the above papers cut across the 5 P’s of sustainable development: people, planet, prosperity, partnerships and peace. A blog post by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that, by articulating objectives in this manner, the SDGs “represent the basic requirements of human decency.” Recognizing the linkages between these principles and their work, the IMF piece identifies how their projects and initiatives map to each pillar.

Humana’s ‘Healthy People’ pillar details its efforts to improve the health of its employees, its members and the communities it serves. The company has instituted the ‘Bold Goal,’ which aims to help communities become 20% healthier by 2020. In 2017, four communities in Texas and New Orleans demonstrated improved health due, in part, to strong relationships among physicians, patients and community groups.

The ‘Healthy Planet’ pillar addresses environmental sustainability, with the report explaining that, since 2014, Humana has reduced emissions by more than 6% and diverted 40% of waste that would have gone to landfills by using less and recycling more. As of 30 June 2018, Humana had achieved a 5% reduction in emissions as a result of investments in building efficiency improvements, optimization of building occupancy rates and new energy-efficient processes. The company aims to decrease emissions by 2.1% each year over a five-year period through 2022, and divert 60% of its waste from landfills by 2022.

‘Healthy Performance’ focuses on implementing best practices in the healthcare industry by promoting inclusion and diversity in Humana’s workforce, supporting employees’ professional development through training programmes, and holding suppliers to high standards. Eight employee-led network resource groups, including one for employees with disabilities, provide platforms for exchanging ideas, building community and driving measurable business outcomes. More than 25% of Humana’s employees participate in the groups.

The report’s content was collected and reported in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which helps businesses, governments and other organizations understand and communicate the impact of business on sustainability issues.

The report highlights a number of issues relevant to implementing the SDGs in South Africa, from partnerships and tools to the role of science, technology and innovation (STI).



The South African SDG Hub, housed at University of Pretoria, aims to connect South African policy makers with research and innovations for implementing the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Implementing the SDGs in South Africa: Challenges and Opportunities,’ presents in graphs the country’s progress against the indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report describes South Africa’s national planning, monitoring and evaluation system for the SDGs, which it says “is coherent and allows for alignment between planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation.” The report explains that Statistics South Africa monitors the SDGs prioritized by the national government, while the remaining Goals “will require social partners to assess relevance, provide data and agree on progress made.” The chapter also addresses promotion of citizen and multi-stakeholder engagements, expansion of youth involvement and knowledge infrastructure.

The report outlines the UN’s engagements with the Government of South Africa on the SDGs. The UN and the Government are discussing a Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) mission that will assess SDG alignment with South Africa’s Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF 2014-2019) and identify SDG Indicators Accelerators. The UN is supporting harmonization of interventions and civil society organization (CSO) accountability through convening 36 CSO alliances under an umbrella agenda, among other actions.

In addition, the UN Global Compact (UNGC) South Africa network has identified strategic action projects aligned with the SDGs, and is working to establish a national SDG institutional coordination mechanism at the provincial and local levels to drive SDG implementation throughout the country.

The report also considers the role of development partners and the role of researchers. It highlights “a large volume of research” relevant to SDG implementation, and identifies the coordination and dissemination of research on SDG implementation as a primary challenge. On STI, the report asserts that, despite considerable investments and advancement, equitable access to knowledge infrastructure remains a challenge, and South Africa is working to promote more equitable access in line with the principle of leave no one behind (LNOB).

TCAP is helping the Government of Tuvalu to better manage the risks of coastal hazards by: implementing measures that reduce the impacts of climate-induced sea level rise and intensifying storm events on infrastructure; developing a long-term coastal adaptation strategy; building the capacity of national and local authorities to better implement adaptation actions; and investing in youth. Specifically, the project focuses on: strengthening institutions, human resources, awareness and knowledge for resilient coastal management; reducing the vulnerability of critical coastal infrastructure to wave-induced damages, including homes, schools and hospitals; and establishing a sustainable financing mechanism for long-term adaptation efforts.

The project focuses on three of Tuvalu’s nine inhabited islands, which have 2,780 meters of high-value vulnerable coastline.

The Summer Island Maldives resort is using the artificial reef made from hundreds of ceramic and concrete modules to build a new coral reef ecosystem.

An Australian industrial engineer with the Reef Design Lab began the project, using computer modeling to build a reef that resembled those found in the Maldives region. The 3D printing process took 24 hours. The molds were then cast in ceramic, which is similar to limestone rock, shipped to Maldives, filled with marine concrete, and assembled and submerged seven meters deep. The coral is now an integral part of the lagoon where the new coral reef ecosystem will be assembled.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits.

In total, 220 ceramic molds were filled with concrete and put together to create a larger reef. As the ceramic and concrete modules are white and therefore do not resemble the surrounding coral, the projects aims to encourage growth and provide a home for marine life, rather than replicate the reef’s natural aesthetic. Real coral fragments were transplanted onto the 3D printed reef, with the expectation that these corals will soon colonize the ceramic molds.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits. The 3D designs are open source for use by other researchers free of charge.

Countries across the world vary tremendously in terms of their burden of disease, and performance in terms of doing what is required. Shortfall in performance can be attributed to several factors that these columns have emphasized: policy, infrastructure, medical staff, and front-line workers.

How we compare country-level performance, identify issues that cut across, and respond to them is the charter of what is called “global health"". Entering into the new millennium, there was a consensus that the world needed an agreed upon set of metrics that would translate into targets for countries and also enable cross-country comparisons. What are these metrics? How well has India done against them? What are we doing to improve our report card? This article touches on these issues.

The year 2000 saw the unprecedented coming together of 189 nation states along with multilateral agencies to reduce multi-dimensional poverty and ensure economic well-being and social development through global partnership. Therein was born the millennium development goals (MDGs) to run from 2000-2015. The MDGs were a set of eight broad metrics that ranged from eradicating extreme hunger (MDG 1) to ensuring environmental sustainability (MDG 7). The operative ones were reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal health (MDG 5) and combating HIV/AIDS and malaria (MDG 6).

India’s performance on the MDGs, especially on health and nutrition, improved but stayed sub-optimal. The ministry of statistics and programme implementation reports that India was only able to achieve the MDG target of halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS and incidences of malaria by 2015. Among the states, only Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved the MDG target of decline in infant death per thousand live births. Similarly, only Kerala and West Bengal managed to achieve the target of decline in maternal deaths per one lakh population.

By the end of the MDG era, there was a feeling that MDGs were too narrow in their scope as they did not touch upon the broader health and developmental issues confronting the world.

This led to the dawn of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to run from 2015 to 2030. The SDGs were signed in September 2015 by the leaders of 170 countries with the objective of finishing the unfinished business of the MDGs. The SDGs are wider in scope in that they covered social and environmental determinants of health such as gender, nutrition, sanitation, sustainable habitats and infrastructure.

Crucially, the SDGs have a formal mechanism of voluntary review by individual countries, by submission to the High-level Political Forum on on Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The SDGs also have a section on means of implementation, which spells out the resources required for its implementation.

So, how is India faring on the SDGs? In the global SDG index that assesses the performance of countries in meeting the SDGs, in 2017, India ranked at 116 out of 157 countries. By way of comparison, Brazil ranks at 56, Bangladesh at 111, Sri Lanka at 89 and China at 54. Specific to health, India ranks at 143 out of 188 countries.

If India wants to succeed on SDGs, political will is the key, and the good news is that there is strong intent. Programmes such as “Transformation of Aspirational Districts"" are a welcome approach by the government of India to localize the SDGs with a focus on health, nutrition, infrastructure, education and agriculture.

Similarly, programmes like Ayushman Bharat, National Nutrition Mission, and the Swachh Bharat Mission can potentially play a pivotal role in meeting the targets under different SDGs. The NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the task of coordinating the SDGs for India, to ensure monitoring at the highest level. That institution is coming up with a much-needed index to assess the performance of Indian states on the SDGs with the objective of spurring competition among them.

Given India’s size, clearly the world will only succeed if India meets the SDGs. We cannot afford to fail.

In doing so, Switzerland created MONET 2030, an indicator system designed to statistically monitor implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a Swiss context. The expanded portal tracks 85 indicators across all 17 SDGs.



Of the 85 indicators monitored, MONET 2030 finds that 39 show a positive trend, 12 show no significant evolution, and 14 identify a reverse trend. These results were highlighted in Switzerland’s Voluntary National Review, which was presented to the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLFP).

MONET 2030 measures progress towards the 85 indicators by comparing observed trends to targeted trends. Targeted trends represent the desired direction of change, while observed trends reflect actual experience. Progress is assessed as positive if observed and targeted trends correspond, as negative if the observed and target trend differ, or as unchanged if the difference is greater than or less than 3%. The MONET 2030 system denotes these trends for each indicator on the front page of the site with symbolic arrows.

Users can explore each indicator in English, French or German by viewing descriptions, methodologies, reports, and graphs, which provide recent and historic data in downloadable formats. Each indicator also compares the Switzerland-defined target to its related international target, highlighting the fact that to achieve the 2030 Agenda, global goals must be assessed within a local context and addressed at the local level.

MONET 2030 is unique among countries’ online SDG portals in that it adapts an existing platform to the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to the Federal Statistical Office.

In a prior effort in SDG tracking, following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, Switzerland’s Federal Council established a commission to conduct a baseline assessment and gap analysis for the implementation of all 169 global SDG targets.

Leading Locally, Achieving Together","With the vision “to build a Resilient Navakavu – O Navakavu Qoi!” the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022 (NRS) was a timely development framework for the Yavusa vakaturaga o Navakavu, a traditional Fijian unit, which comprise of five villages – Muaivuso, Nabaka, Waiqanake, Namakala and Ucuinamono. It is a leading example of how local governance structures are helping to meet national and international development frameworks and priorities.

With the mission to revitalize, strengthen and position Navakavu to engage in opportunities for growth and prosperity for a transformed Fiji, the NRS is linked to the Fiji National Development Plan 2017-2021 (NDP) and the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 (SDGs). The NRS was officially launched by the Prime Minister of Fiji and President of UNFCCC COP 23 Honourable Josaia V Bainimarama on 6 June 2018, at the Novotel Conference Centre. In a statement supporting the NRS mission, he said:

“… [W]e recognize that there is immense opportunity in a growing Fijian economy, and we want to put the Yavusa o Navakavu in the best possible position to realize those opportunities… Today marks the beginning of your conference to launch the Navakavu Revitalization Plan from 2018-2022, a plan that builds upon the strategic blueprint laid out in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan….I applaud your community for coming together to determine how you can capitalize on all the great progress and all the new opportunity that has come to Fiji. Because a government alone can only do so much. It can create a favorable environment, but it is up to individuals to take advantage…]”

The five NRS Strategic Goals that link to the Fiji NDP and SDGs address, inter alia, employment, housing, education, health, land, and infrastructure. The NRS strategic goals show how national development plans (the NDP) as well as international development roadmaps (the SDGs) can be implemented at the local level in a way that reflects local needs and priorities.

The five NRS Strategic Goals address employment, housing, education, health, land and infrastructure.

The NRS launch coincided with the 21st Anniversary of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA), which is helping to meet the targets of the SDG on life below water (SDG 14), among others. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua o Navakavu with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In Navakavu, there is a local Committee comprised of family unit heads that has worked to increase awareness of the need for, and the implementation of, strategies for fisheries conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources in the area.

The paramount chief of Navakavu, the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni, and His Council have approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protection Area to platform its long-term plan of a Live Marine/Science Laboratory, which would serve as an initiative integrating conservation, education and tourism objectives. Community discussions are underway on this “Navakavu Reef to Ridge Initiative.” It covers an area of some 3.3 square km, which is equivalent to approximately 18% of the community fishing ground area of 18.5 square km.

Local efforts are also targeting youth to ensure longevity and the intergenerational reach of projects. On 29 June 2018, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the Chief Guest with the Navakavu Youth in commemorating the World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his Council joined the youth together with officials from the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry, FLMMA network and Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation (PIANGO).

The commemoration of the Navakavu Youth World Oceans Day is in line with the Goals under the Sustainable Development Goals, the Fiji National Development Plan, the Plan for the Yasana o Rewa, the Tikina o Suva and Goal 4 of the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022.

The children and youth replanted mangroves and native trees to celebrate the day and plans are in place to clean up rubbish from our land and our beaches and our ocean.

147,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/india-presents-the-first-bonn-challenge-country-progress-report/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,India Presents the First Bonn Challenge Country Progress Report,"14 August 2018: India has published the first-ever country progress report under the Bonn Challenge on forest landscape restoration, which concludes that the country is on track to achieve its pledge of restoring 13 million hectares of degraded land by 2020 and an additional 8 million hectares by 2030.

The report titled, ‘Bonn Challenge and India: Progress on Restoration Efforts across States and Landscapes,’ is co-published by the India Country Office of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Based on a survey of secondary data on interventions by government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOS) and the private sector, the report states that India restored approximately 9.8 million hectares of degraded land between 2011 and 2017, with nearly 95% of the restoration activities reported being led by government agencies. Despite the limited data on private sector and NGO restoration efforts, the report emphasizes the vital role that all stakeholders play in the planning and implementation of restoration programmes, highlighting NGOs’ technical expertise and knowledge of local conditions and private companies’ financing capacity.

Among “transformational changes” brought about by public restoration programmes, the report notes increased biodiversity and forest productivity linked to the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) approach. Some of the benefits listed include the creation of livelihood opportunities in remote areas by linking villages to markets for sale of non-timber forest products, better irrigation facilities for crop production, and improved transport and health care facilities. Moreover, the report notes that by providing villagers with opportunities to participate in micro-plans, the JFMC model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by successfully involving communities in the protection and sustainable harvesting of natural resources and bringing in expertise and aligned interests of multiple stakeholders in forest restoration, “thereby making it socially more inclusive.”

The Joint Forest Management Committee model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by making forest restoration “socially more inclusive.”

On the role of the private sector, the report analyzes submissions by 11 private companies, noting that many afforestation and restoration activities undertaken by private companies are often a result of legal compliance, or form part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations. The report finds that out of the total 193,290.3 hectares of land restored and afforested by the surveyed private companies, around 97% was under mixed plantations containing fast-growing exotic tree species as well as cash crops. It calls for “a more bio-centric approach” to motivate private companies to adopt more sustainable and ecological models of restoration based on native species that are adapted to local conditions and better suited to the recovery of faunal diversity.

Drawing on 14 submitted contributions by NGOs, the report notes that this sector plays a “small but active role” in the restoration of degraded lands, including unique and threatened ecosystems such as grasslands and mangroves. Of the total 352,677.9 hectares restored by the surveyed NGOs, the report notes that a total of 322,610.9 hectares (91.5%) was restored using mixed plantation model, while 8.5% of restoration activities were based on using a mono plantation model, mainly in coastal areas planted with mangrove.

The report draws on five case studies across seven states “that have all the indicators of a good restoration model” with a view to promoting broader learning and upscaling of restoration efforts. The case studies highlight different approaches and partnership arrangements, including from a government-funded joint forest management committee in Nagaland, NGO-led grassland and rainforest projects in Gujarat and Valparai respectively, and efforts by Tata Power to reverse environmental degradation in Lonavala region caused by the construction of the Valvan Dam.

While concluding that India is appropriately positioned to meet its restoration commitments under the Bonn Challenge, the report notes that additional efforts are needed to comprehensively capture the restoration efforts being undertaken by all actors in future stocktaking reports. The report further emphasizes the importance of verifying the quality of reported restoration efforts through the adoption of a robust monitoring, evaluation and learning system, and recommends that better use be made of NGOs’ technical knowledge and use of scientifically robust monitoring protocols to support such efforts.

Noting overall progress towards forest landscape restoration goals across the region, IUCN observes that at the first Bonn Challenge roundtable in Asia, held in May 2017 in Palembang, Indonesia, restoration pledges crossed the 150 million hectare milestone.

The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030.

148,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures

Article content Everywhere from Windsor, to Cornwall, to Thunder Bay, voters will be marking their “X” next to the name of their preferred mayoral candidates and local representatives. But, there’s another, often overlooked elected office voters will have the opportunity to decide on. And, given the controversy surrounding school closures and sexual health education over the past year, the role of school board trustee may be getting more attention from voters come election day. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures Back to video Trustees represent the interests of their constituents on any of the four publicly funded school boards. They are not involved in the day-to-day aspect of running and managing a school, but do work heavily with the province, parents, educators, and students on many important matters that affect our communities. Voters in Cornwall won’t have much of a say in who their trustees are, for better or worse. All incumbents on the English public, English Catholic, French public, and French Catholic boards who represent Cornwall were acclaimed. In fact, all of the French-speaking trustees across Cornwall and SDG are acclaimed.

Article content However, in some rural communities, the race for trustee for the Upper Canada District School Board could be more high profile than most years. In Stormont and Glengarry, there will be an exciting three-way race. The incumbent will not be seeking re-election, leaving the job open. The Mayor of South Stormont, Jim Bancroft, who will be leaving the council table this fall, hopes to continuing serving with the school board. “I feel comfortable that it’s time to move on,” said Bancroft. “I hope the community will recognize that I care about the community, I believe our schools need to be represented as strong as we can.” He will be challenged by former student trustee Marshal Wilson. Wilson was involved with the board through the school closure process, which he credits as the main reason for why he became so intimately involved in the role. “The one thing that differentiates me, in my mind and with most people I talk to, is the type of experience I have,” said Wilson. “There’s no real learning curve for me. I’m already familiar with how the board works.” Also in the running in Stormont and Glengarry is John Danaher. Danaher is a retired principal, and has been familiar with the workings of the UCDSB for most of his life. He also has nine grandchildren currently in school. “Unfortunately education is very political,” said Danaher. “I think with the school closures, and I think with what’s coming forth with the change of [Provincial] government, if there are changes there, we have to be ready to work with them.”

Article content English public school voters in North Dundas and South Dundas will also have a choice to make come election day. Jeremy Armer, who could not be reached for comment at the time of publication, will be challenged by retired local principal Larry Berry. “I threw my name in because I’d like to be involved in education, I’m positive towards the board, I’m not axe-grinding. It’s a positive bid to become the trustee,” said Berry. Berry wanted to see someone become a staunch supporter of the smaller, rural schools in his district. He also wants to see boards support regular classroom teachers better, and encourage more physical activity among students, something he strongly supported during his time as an educator. Dundas voters (North and South) will also have the opportunity to elect a trustee to the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario, along with voters in Stormont who they share a district with. Incumbent Karen McAllister will be running against Donna Neilsen.

152,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-group-releases-child-mortality-estimates-sdg-target-not-in-view-until-after-2050/,"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Group Releases Child Mortality Estimates: SDG Target Not in View Until After 2050,"18 September 2018: Half of all deaths of children under five occur in sub-Saharan Africa, while one-third occur in South Asia, according to a 2018 report by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Children are most at risk in their first year, with the highest risk being among newborns in their first month of life. Based on current trends, the authors anticipate that about half the countries in the world will not achieve SDG targets on child mortality by 2030, but only after 2050.



The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Population Division of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the World Bank collaborated on the child mortality report, which shows uneven progress, although child survival has improved among all age groups since the year 2000. Children in the poorest households are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from the richest. Rural children are more at risk than urban children, and the children of mothers without any education are 2.6 times more likely to die before reaching the age of five, compared to the children of mothers with high school or tertiary-level education.

Environmental factors also influence child mortality. For example, exposure to air pollution is a factor in higher mortality levels among children under the age of one, the Group reports.

The agencies note that child mortality has declined in recent years, especially in children between one and four years old, where it declined by 60% between the years 2000 and 2017. Deaths of children under one year declined by 51% during the same period, while the rate for children aged 5-14 declined by 37%. However, in many places improvements are insufficient for meeting the 2030 deadline.

The report contains charts detailing progress by region and subregion, and calls for concerted efforts, investments and innovative approaches to accelerate progress, particularly in countries and communities that are falling behind.

The report responds to the main theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies – and reviews Taiwan’s implementation of the six SDGs reviewed by the HLPF in 2018.



Taiwan launched a Voluntary National Review on the SDGs on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, US, in September 2017. During the launch, EPA Minister Lee Ying-yuan said Taiwan will promote sustainable development, implement the SDGs in a timely manner, and share the results of global partnership with the international community. He also urged other countries to work with Taiwan in pursuit of sustainable development for the world and all humankind.

The 2018 Report on SDG Implementation addresses issues and concerns raised by the participants of seven public fora held in Taiwan by the National Council for Sustainable Development in 2017 and 2018, focusing on six issues identified as priorities: smart water resources management; sustainable energy transformation; clean air; sustainable materials management and the circular economy; ecological conservation and green networks; and international partnerships for the SDGs. The report’s analysis sets out Taiwan’s vision for these issues, exploring their current status and describing measures to be taken.

In addition, the report indicates that the National Council for Sustainable Development, which is chaired by the Premier, is formulating Taiwan’s own sustainable development goals, with the SDGs as its reference. To implement Taiwan’s SDGs, the report says the government will work with other countries to realize the official SDGs and will set down more ambitious targets for Taiwan’s sustainable development than those enshrined in the SDGs.

Taiwan’s SDGs comprise 18 goals, 143 targets, and 342 indicators. The 18 goals are:

Strengthen social care services and economic security for the disadvantaged

End hunger, ensure food safety, and promote sustainable agriculture

Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages

Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Ensure environmental quality and sustainable management of environmental resources

Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

Build an affordable, safe, environmentally friendly, resilient, and sustainable transportation structure

Reduce inequality within Taiwan, and between Taiwan and other countries

Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Improve adaptive actions to combat climate change and its impacts

Conserve and sustainably use the marine ecosystems, and prevent the degradation of marine environment

Conserve and sustainably use terrestrial ecosystems to ensure the persistence of biodiversity and prevent land degradation

Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable inclusive institutions

Establish diversified partnerships and work together to advance a sustainable vision

Build a nuclear-free homeland by 2025

During an interview on 18 September 2018, Chan highlighted Taiwan’s achievements against these goals, including the reduction of both household and industrial waste by 80% and biodiversity conservation, with eight of Taiwan’s species previously on the endangered list no longer endangered. He also noted Taiwan’s Electricity Act that states that, by 2025, nuclear power generation equipment should be completely shut down and the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix should reach 20%.

155,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-surveys-e-government-practices-worldwide-for-sdg-achievement/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Surveys E-Government Practices Worldwide for SDG Achievement,"19 July 2018: The tenth edition of the UN E-Government Survey, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), concludes that while e-government began with bringing services online, the future will be about the power of digital government to leverage societal innovation and resilience, and to transform governance to better achieve the SDGs.



The survey is the “only global report” that assesses e-government development status of all UN Member States, according to the authors. It measures e-government effectiveness in the delivery of public services, and aims to enable countries to learn from each other, identify areas of strength and challenges in e-government and shape their policies and strategies in this area.

The 2018 edition of the survey titled, ‘Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies,’ seeks to provide analysis and evidence to “further utilize the potential of e-government” to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The survey examines: the preconditions and the enabling environment for mobilizing e-government to build resilient societies; e-resilience and building the resilience of e-government; global trends in e-government; regional development and country groupings performance; improving cities resilience and sustainability through e-government assessment; and fast-evolving technologies in e-government.

Among its conclusions, the survey notes that since 2014, all 193 UN Member States have been delivering some form of online presence. According to the 2018 E-Government Development Index (EGDI) − a composite index which assesses e-government development at the national level, including the provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human capacity − Denmark, Australia and the Republic of Korea lead the world in providing government services and information through the internet, followed by the UK, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France and Japan. The survey also presents the findings of a pilot study on applying e-governance to local governments in 40 municipalities around the world. It lists as the top cities: Moscow, Russian Federation; Cape Town, South Africa; Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rome, Italy; and Warsaw, Poland. The EGDI is presented bi-annually by DESA.

Per the survey, since 2012, there is a “steady increase” in the number of country websites with information about specific programmes benefiting women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous people, and people living in poverty. The report indicates that a growing number of countries provides targeted online services to vulnerable groups: 86% in the Americas; 79% in Asia; 57% in Africa; and 15% in Oceania. However, despite some development gains and major investments in several countries, e-government and digital divides persist, it says. For instance, 14 countries in the Low EGDI group are African and belong to the least developed countries (LDCs). The survey also finds that insufficient training and accessibility and “e-illiteracy” are the most common barriers to e-government resilience.

The publication stresses that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as an enabler of all phases of disaster risk management, from prevention, reduction, and preparedness to respond and recover, and emphasizes the need to protect critical ICT infrastructure from disaster impacts. In addition, it states that inter-regional and global data sharing and coordination among concerned countries and regions are crucial, considering that some disasters such as floods, cyclones and typhoons, and droughts are transboundary in nature.

The survey was produced by the DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) in collaboration with UN regional commissions, UN agencies, and several international experts, researchers and related organizations. The E-Government Survey was first issued in 2001, and further editions were released in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

The scientists urge increased international efforts to enhance global awareness of oxygen depletion, immediate and decisive action to limit marine pollution and decisive climate change mitigation actions to limit global warming.

The scientists convened in Kiel, Germany, for a conference on the theme, ‘Climate and Biogeochemical Interactions in the Tropical Ocean,’ organized by the Global Ocean Oxygen Network (GO2NE), an expert group established in 2016 under UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO-IOC) and the Collaborative Research Centre 754 (SFB 754). The conference took place from 3-7 September.

According to UNESCO-IOC, oxygen has decreased by two percent in the world’s oceans over the past 50 years, and the volume of oxygen-depleted water has grown fourfold. The reasons for this deoxygenation include increasing global warming and over-fertilization of the oceans, which leads to algae blooms and increased depletion of oxygen through biomass degradation. These changes are further expected to change feedbacks in the atmosphere as greenhouse gases (GHGs), including methane and nitrous oxide, form in the oxygen-free water.

The reasons for ocean deoxygenation include increasing global warming and over-fertilization of the oceans.

The ‘Kiel Declaration’ states that oxygen in the ocean “supports the largest ecosystems on the planet,” and expresses alarm that the ocean is losing oxygen, primarily as a result of GHG emissions and pollution by nutrients and organic waste. The Declaration recognizes that both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “demand conservation and sustainable use of the ocean, seas and marine resources,” but stresses that these aims are “severely threatened by ocean deoxygenation.”

The Declaration calls on the UN, all countries, scientists and others to: raise global awareness about ocean deoxygenation through global, regional and local efforts, including interdisciplinary research and ocean education; take immediate and decisive action to limit pollution, particularly excessive nutrient input; and limit global warming through decisive climate change mitigation actions. The Declaration describes increases in deoxygenation over time, and provides evidence on how global warming impacts ocean oxygen and how deoxygenation disrupts marine ecosystems, affects fish stocks and leads to loss of biodiversity and habitats, among other evidence.

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

The projects were based on the Global Compact’s Tenth Principle (anti-corruption) and on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), with a focus on SDG target 16.5 to “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.”Through the projects, which were supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative Second Funding Round, businesses, governments and civil society worked to increase compliance standards across Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria.

In Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria, the project connected various stakeholders to discuss challenges and opportunities, as well as to identify collective efforts to combat corruption, increase transparency, and create an enabling environment for businesses and flourishing societies. The UNGC’s four Local Networks organized workshops that engaged 900 participants, helping them develop resources to improve anti-corruption compliance among business participants and establish a strategy to ensure ongoing commitment towards anti-corruption.

In Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Junior Business Association, UNGC created the Integrity Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder, business-led group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) committed to tackling corruption. SMEs that joined the Initiative signed a ten-step Integrity Pledge and were trained on various aspects of anti-corruption compliance. The project trained personnel from over 400 SMEs and developed guidance materials for SMEs on topics including transparency in customs, public procurement, code of conduct, and internal controls, along with an online support desk.

To mark the completion of the projects, UNGC released the second edition of its publication titled, ‘Promoting Anti-Corruption Collective Action through Global Compact Local Networks.’

Also to increase government transparency, improve accountability, and strengthen citizen engagement as well as government responsiveness, on 19 July 2018 the World Bank and development partners launched the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The US$12 million Fund was created with Agence Française de Développement, the Department for International Development UK, and Global Affairs Canada.

In countries and sub-nationals that participate in the OGP, the MDTF will support implementation of open government reforms, an inclusive and participatory dialogue and decision-making process, and build an evidence base on the impact of open government reforms.

Among other activities, participants celebrated the winners of the Stockholm Water Prize and the Stockholm Junior Water Prize.

World Water Week attracted a record number of 3,700 participants. It opened with calls for nature-based solutions, such as “green infrastructure” in cities, to protect and restore water resources. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, in her opening address, highlighted ways to spread the risk from water-related disasters in a more equitable manner, and urged all concerned to be involved in actions for addressing the world’s water crisis.

Torgny Homgren, SIWI Executive Director, declared that water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world. Other speakers referred to examples where water scarcity has contributed to poverty, conflict, and the spread of waterborne diseases, as well as hindering access to education for women and girls.

The UNFCCC, in a press release, noted the pressures exerted by climate change on food security and health around the world, adding that water scarcity also calls into question the future of water-intensive energy production.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 launched a set of global baseline reports during World Water Week, bringing together work undertaken through the World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

On the proportion of wastewater that is safely treated (SDG indicator 6.3.1), the WHO and UN Habitat report that, based on data from 79 countries, only 59% of domestic wastewater is collected and safely treated, while insufficient information is available to estimate the level of industrial wastewater treatment.

Water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world, said SIWI Executive Director, Torgny Homgren.

On ambient water quality (SDG indicator 6.3.2), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) finds that, based on 52 submissions, more than half the water bodies assessed are of good quality. However, the authors propose mapping of trends in water quality to indicate whether water bodies are improving, stable or degrading, noting that it is not practical to set universal parameters of water quality.

Regarding progress on water-use efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) notes that average water-use efficiency currently stands at around US$15/m3 worldwide, though there are significant differences among countries and regions.

On the level of water stress (SDG indicator 6.4.2), FAO reports that water stress increased between 1996 and 2016 for most countries in the world, and has more than doubled in 26 countries, 15 of which are in Africa.

On the degree of integrated water resource management (IWRM) implementation (SDG indicator 6.5.1), UN Environment reports that 80% of countries have laid the foundations to establish IWRM, but that 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve the target of implementing IWRM at all levels by 2030 (SDG target 6.5). Hence, the report notes, multi-level coordination and collective, multi-stakeholder measures will be critical.

On the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement for water cooperation (SDG indicator 6.5.2), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) find insufficient progress, and propose undertaking joint projects that alleviate poverty and conflict, in tandem with water-related objectives.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG indicator 6.6.1), a report published by UN Environment on behalf of UN-Water notes that, while severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 is slow. The report calls for “significantly upscaling” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

World Water Week celebrated innovations in the field of water treatment. Stockholm Water Prize laureates Bruce Rittmann and Mark van Loosdrecht were recognized for their work in biotechnology-based processes to treat drinking water and waste water, while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment. A ceremony highlighted the contribution of the two scientists to better understanding how microorganisms can transform organic pollutants in water. Kartik Chandran, World Water Prize Committee, noted in a blog post the potential of environmental biotechnology not only for improving drinking water and recycling or purifying wastewater, but also in interacting with complex biological systems to enable the achievement of goals in energy, food, and human health.

Also honored during World Water Week were the winners of the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, Caleb Liow Jia Le and Johnny Xiao Hong Yu from Singapore. The two teenagers have developed a way to produce reduced grapheme oxide, which can purify water, using locally available durian rind and sugarcane fiber.

Ministers addressed, inter alia, transitions to a low-emissions economy, ocean plastics and developing sustainable energy sources.

The ministerial meeting took place from 19-21 September 2018 in Halifax, Canada.

On 19 September, G7 environment ministers addressed, inter alia: long-term economic transitions to a low-carbon economy; circular economy and resource efficiency; urgent action on climate change, including opportunities to reduce emissions and climate finance; and adaptation and the conservation of nature. The meeting also discussed implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement on climate change, which are expected to be adopted at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. [Chair’s Summary: G7 Environment Ministers’ Meeting]

On 20 September, the G7 Joint Ministerial Session on ‘Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities’ brought together environment and oceans ministers to discuss, inter alia, ways to advance the priorities identified in the ‘Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Coastal Communities.’ More specifically, the meeting discussed: addressing marine plastic pollution through social and technological innovation; supporting sustainable oceans and fisheries by combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; increasing ocean knowledge by expanding global observation efforts as well as sharing scientific data; and supporting innovative solutions and financing to develop clean and resilient energy systems in vulnerable coastal communities.

The meeting also addressed the Ocean Plastics Charter, launched at the G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, in June 2018, where five of the G7 leaders and the EU agreed to the charter. The agreement requires broader international commitment to stop using oceans as open dumps, with more than half of the waste coming from non-G7 Asian countries. Further collaboration on these issues is expected to continue at the global level during the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference that Canada is co-hosting in Nairobi, Kenya, from 26-28 November 2018.

During the ministerial, Canada committed to divert at least 75% of plastic waste from government operations by 2030.

The G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council also made a presentation, noting the crosscutting nature of gender equality, the importance of accounting for the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls, and the need to support women’s leadership on climate and oceans issues. [GEAC Recommendations]

In addition, the winners of the Oceans Youth Innovation Challenge and representatives of the Oceans Partnership Summit made presentations. The G7 Ocean Partnership Summit, which convened on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting from 19-20 September, addressed coastal resilience, marine litter and sustainable fisheries, and showcased concrete actions in these areas.

On 21 September, discussions during the G7 energy ministers’ meeting addressed ‘Building the Energy Systems of Tomorrow (BEST),’ focusing on: developing sustainable energy resources; preparing the workforce; promoting interconnected, open, transparent and stable energy markets; and modernizing power systems. In addition, the meeting discussed the transition away from fossil fuels and offshore energy development, gender equality in the energy sector, and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. The meeting agreed on two joint initiatives on advancing collaboration on cybersecurity and modernization of power systems. [Chair’s Summary: G7 Energy Ministers’ Meeting]

During its Presidency, Canada has been promoting strong engagement with domestic and international partners, the private sector, and indigenous peoples and local communities to advance climate action, accelerate clean energy innovation and commercialization, and mobilize action on oceans health and resilience. During the environment, oceans and energy ministerial, Canada committed to, inter alia: investing up to C$11.6 million to combat IUU fishing; diverting at least 75% of plastic waste from government operations by 2030; and providing C$60 million to help small island developing States (SIDS) “build back better” after extreme weather events by, for example, accelerating their transition to cleaner energy systems.

163,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-gender-equality-strategy-addresses-structural-barriers-to-sdg-5/,"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Gender Equality Strategy Addresses Structural Barriers to SDG 5,"6 September 2018: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) announced its Third Gender Equality Strategy, which is aligned with the 2030 Agenda and covers the period 2018-2021. The strategy outlines how UNDP will “elevate and integrate” gender equality across all of its work.

UNDP’s Third Gender Equality Strategy outlines four priorities to address structural barriers to gender equality. The priorities are:

removing structural barriers to women’s economic empowerment, including women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid work;

preventing and responding to gender-based violence;

promoting women’s participation and leadership in all forms of decision-making; and

strengthening gender-responsive strategies in conflict and disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery.

Improving women’s access to productive resources could reduce the number of hungry people by 12-17% globally.

The four-year strategy provides evidence on how gender equality accelerates development. For instance, when women participate in peace agreements as negotiators, mediators, signatories or witnesses, peace agreements are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years. In another example, if women have the same access to productive resources as men, women would increase their farm yields by 20-30%, which would then increase the total agricultural output for developing countries by 2.5-4% annually and reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17%.

The strategy includes an annex on lessons learned from implementation of UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017. The key lessons – which the 2018-2021 aims to address – include the importance of addressing structural barriers to gender equality, ranging from legal and institutional to attitudinal and societal barriers, and tackling structural challenges, including care responsibilities that prevent women from equally participating in the economy. Other lessons learned include the need to mainstream gender equality in climate action and crisis resilience, an area in which UNDP intends to focus more attention in its new strategy. The strategy calls for integrating gender equality and women’s participation at the earliest stages possible and for creating opportunities for women to contribute to and participate in sustainable livelihoods in ways that improve outcomes for them and their families. UNDP will launch guidance for country offices on how to improve their work on fragility and recovery from a gender lens.

The 2018-2021 strategy calls for working more closely with civil society and the private sector, including by creating space and opportunities for women’s organizations and networks. The strategy recognizes the role of the private sector in creating a decent work environment for women and changing behaviors, values and norms. To advance this work, the strategy identifies two initiatives: the Private Sector Seal, a certification program for companies; and the Inclusion and Equitable Development Programme, which will work to unlock public and private investments in gender sensitive projects at the local level in least developed countries (LDCs).

Introducing the Third Strategy to the UNDP Executive Board, Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UNDP, emphasized the central role of gender equality in the 2030 Agenda. In addition to SDG 5, he said gender equality is reflected in 36 SDG targets and 54 SDG indicators across the Global Goals. Dieye stressed that gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential in ensuring that no one is left behind, and said UNDP will work to ensure gender equality is part of all its development efforts. As part of this effort, the UNDP Administrator plans to sign on as an International Gender Champion, while senior managers throughout UNDP are expected to champion gender equality in meetings and speeches and ensure gender balance in panels and missions.

UNDP notes that the strategy is consistent with the Common Chapter of the strategic plans of UNDP, UN Women, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), as well as with direction received from the UN’s Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR).

UNDP and UN Women have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on strengthened collaboration. Key areas of cooperation in the MOU include: policy and legal reforms to advance gender equality; economic empowerment; mobilizing the private sector to advance gender equality; women’s political leadership; gender based-violence; and crises/post-crises response and early recovery.

It also stresses that the window for action to address climate change – an underlying cause of migration – is closing.

Originally published on Project Syndicate, the article notes that the current “take-make-dispose” paradigm has drastically increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rates and must be changed. GHG emissions, they stress, need to be cut drastically if the world is to stay below 2°C of warming above preindustrial levels.

Solheim and Lacy Swing summarize key causes of migration, highlighting that lack of economic opportunities, environmental degradation, and increased mobility triggered by new forms of travel have contributed to “human displacement and unsafe migration on an unprecedented scale.” Climate change, they note, exacerbates already record high migration levels.

Without addressing root causes, the migration problem, which is “already upon us,” will continue to spiral.

Although it recognizes increasing resilience to natural disasters, the article provides examples of where and how climate change is “redrawing the map” of human activity. It highlights water stress and scarcity in North Africa and the Middle East, increasing droughts and heatwaves as driving zero-sum competition for resources that results in increasingly common mass displacements.

The authors flag the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, on which UN Member States reached agreement in July 2018 and which is due to be adopted in December 2018, noting that it offers a framework for action on climate-driven migration. Underscoring the importance of implementing the Compact, Solheim and Lacy Swing note the opportunity presented by an internationally-agreed system for safe and orderly migration, and that achieving migration that upholds peoples’ dignity is inextricably linked to climate action. Without addressing root causes, the problem – which is “already upon us,” they emphasize – will continue to spiral.

Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

The paper uses examples from Bangladesh, Chile, Ecuador and Nepal.

The report titled, ‘Challenges and Opportunities in Assessing Sustainable Mountain Development Using the UN Sustainable Development Goals,’ aims to help contextualize and highlight the specific needs and challenges for mountain communities and ecosystems in addressing SMD. The study notes that countries often apply their own definition of mountain areas, which can make it challenging to compare results across countries. To address this challenge, the report suggests decentralizing efforts to monitor the SDGs at the regional level using a jointly agreed approach.

For over half of the SDG indicators relevant for SMD, no internationally established methodology or standards are available for data collection or data are not regularly produced.

Although three SDG targets specifically refer to mountains (target 6.6, target 15.1 and target 15.4), the report emphasizes that all SDGs should be considered for SMD. At the same time, given calls for developing subsets of indicators that can assess local progress, the report identifies a subset of SDG indicators relevant for monitoring and reporting on SMD, and discusses challenges and opportunities for reporting on these indicators. For example, for over half of the SDG indicators relevant for SMD, no internationally established methodology or standards are available for data collection or data are not regularly produced, which means that proxy data are required. The report suggests collaboration with local organizations to fill gaps in SDG data because such actors frequently have good knowledge of location conditions and sources of data. The report recommends that such indicators be relevant to SMD, applicable to different mountain regions worldwide and practical to use.

SDG target 6.6 aims to, by 2020, “protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.” Target 15.1 aims to, by 2020, “ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements and target 15.4.” Target 15.4 seeks to, by 2030, “ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.”

Namibia’s NDC Partnership Plan connects international resources for climate action to priority areas set by the government for implementing its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and builds a community around climate action in the country.

The priority areas outlined in the Plan are:

developing better framework conditions for effective climate change governance;

strengthening financing of projects that help reduce emissions, and enhancing the country’s resilience against the effects of climate change;

tracking progress towards emission reduction targets; and

strengthening coordination across national and international stakeholders to fast track decisions and interagency collaboration.

In its NDC, Namibia has committed to reduce emissions by 89% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario through climate-smart agriculture (CSA), reducing deforestation and renewable energy. To reduce the country’s vulnerability to climate change, Namibia has sought to, inter alia, improve water security, prevent desertification and increase resilience to flooding. To achieve these goals, Namibia has relied on the NDC Partnership’s integrated planning process to strengthen coordination, resource mobilization and transparency on NDC implementation.

Many NDC Partnership members have pledged to support Namibia’s Partnership Plan, including the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the European Commission (EC), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Launched in 2016, the NDC Partnership aims to enhance cooperation so that countries can access technical knowledge and financial support to achieve climate goals and the SDGs. The Partnership has grown to 83 member countries, 19 institutional members and seven associate members.

The report highlights that the positive effects of secondary school education for girls include near-elimination of child marriage.

The publication titled, ‘Missed Opportunities: The High Cost of Not Educating Girls,’ reports that fewer than two-thirds of girls in low-income countries complete primary school, and only one in three girls completes lower secondary school. SDG target 4.1 calls for ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030.

On average, the report notes, women who have a secondary education are more likely to work and they earn almost twice as much as those with no education. Secondary school education for girls also brings the near elimination of child marriage, lowers fertility rates by one-third in countries with high population growth, and reduces child mortality and malnutrition. In addition, the report highlights that women with secondary education are less likely to experience intimate partner violence, report higher levels of psychological well-being, and have healthier children who are more likely to go to school and learn.

Over the past 20 years, many countries have reached universal primary education, with girls’ enrollment at the primary level in developing countries rivaling that of boys. However, the report notes, larger benefits of education would come from completing secondary school.

In order to reap the full benefits of education, the publication recommends that countries improve both access to and quality of education for girls, and implement policies to support healthy economic growth that will generate jobs for an expanding educated workforce. It underlines that investments in the education system are especially crucial in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 40% of girls complete lower secondary school.

Failure to take action now means that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be met, undermining the credibility of the international community and leaving millions to die unnecessarily.

The report, SDG Progress: Fragility, Crisis and Leaving No One Behind, examines country-level progress against the SDGs and makes projections as to how much more effort will be needed to reach them by 2030. The findings come one year before the first heads of state level SDG Summit to track progress on the global goals will take place.

Despite the 2015 commitment by governments to ‘leave no behind’ as part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda, unless significant progress is made in reaching the poorest and most marginalized people, including those refugees, internally displaced people, and people living in conflict zones, the SDGs will not be met.

The report concludes by laying out five recommendations to ensure people in crisis and other marginalized groups are prioritized in SDG implementation. Recommendations include the establishment of a high-level panel of global leaders to catalyze international action over the next 12 months, and a formalized process for tracking progress at country-level.

Behind all of these numbers is the harsh reality of disrupted lives. Families without hope or a home, children out of school, young people with no jobs and poor health, struggling to survive and living in conflict or in a new country that are often already grappling with its own poverty and lack of opportunities.

Our analysis shows that progress is possible even in the most challenging situations. Without this action, the world will fail to meet the SDGs.

The aquadrone aims to stop plastic pollution at the source, eliminating floating debris before it drifts into the world’s oceans.

Preventing and reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, is the aim of SDG target 14.1. SDG 14 (life below water) focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

The aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

RanMarine Technology modeled the WasteShark after the whale shark, a filter feeder that consumes plankton and small crustaceans by sucking them through its long, flat mouth. The WasteShark has “an enormous mouth” that is designed to skim the water and track down trash, operating based on the same principles as the whale shark. The aquadron is best suited to collect trash in areas known as “waste chokeholds” such as canals, harbors, ponds and rivers.

The WasteShark can swim for up to 16 hours and collect up to 200 liters of trash in one trip. It is capable of sending information back to a central command, including data on pH levels, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and other water quality parameters.

This article is brought to you thanks to the strategic cooperation of The European Sting with the World Economic Forum. Author: Carolien de Bruin, CEO and founder, C-Change & Josephine Damstra, Partnership lead, C-Change & Dave Prescott, Senior Associate, The Partnering Initiative (TPI) We invite you to visit the streets of New York during the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the annual meeting where leaders from across the world, from all sectors and all impact domains, come together to expedite their progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These leaders and their entourages converge on the same stretches of congested, restricted-access roads. Traffic barely moves and a lack of signposting means they often struggle to determine the conversations in which to take part and whom to join in action.

The physical traffic situation during the UNGA is a fitting metaphor for the state of the online infrastructure that underpins the sustainable development agenda today. Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing. A CEO survey by PwC suggests in 2015 only 13% corporate CEOs had the tools in place to measure their impact against the SDGs. While we believe that this number has since shifted, delivery barriers still exist and will be apparent in public sector and civil society organizations alike.

Meanwhile, C-Change research has found 200 online platforms dedicated to facilitating learning, collaboration or the channelling of financial and non-financial support towards sustainability. Few have reached the critical mass needed to do so effectively and at scale, while many exist in isolation or even operate in competition with one another. The result is a fragmented, sub-scale system. TPI has found a similar pattern in its work supporting the development of in-country platforms dedicated to encouraging multi-stakeholder partnerships for the SDGs.

This infrastructure gap results in a reality where not enough is known about actual, on-the-ground needs and solutions, or where much needed, collaborative action agendas fall flat. It also means that essential capital doesn’t reach the businesses or organizations that deliver these solutions or that they fail to go the last mile in achieving measurable results. Resources go to waste and we are back in a congested traffic situation, with hundreds of actors getting lost, stuck without fuel or arriving late at their destination.

We believe the current situation is untenable and unnecessary. Untenable as we are getting dangerously close to doing irreparable damage to our world and urgently need new tools of the trade that effectively shift behaviours and enable sustainable decision-making; unnecessary, as we collectively have the resources, skills, and technologies to do so. It is high time we collectively bring our SDG infrastructure and online systems into the 21st century.

Our five-point transformation plan is simple in intention but ambitious in scope:

1. Universal standards, tools and definitions

In a recent blog post, the Omidyar Network calls for shared definitions, tools, standards and data to help investors navigate an increasingly diverse impact market. We agree and would add that the same is true across the development field, where efforts to build platforms for multistakeholder collaboration too often lack alignment. Such alignment between platforms is critical to ensure capital flows to the most effective investment opportunities. It is also needed to create the maps that allow individual actors and consortia to carve out their paths and destinations. Efforts such as those by the Impact Management Project (IMP) and the World Benchmarking Alliance, who collectively consulted more than 1,000 organizations from all sectors on effective ways to evaluate impact, are critical to achieving such alignment. The UN has an important role to play in translating such standards to the SDG framework.

2. A shared, interoperable SDG backbone and open architecture

An easy mistake to make in the world of collaboration and platform development is launching a new solution with the intention of immediately becoming a ‘platform of platforms’. Addressing fragmentation by adding a new solution can hardly be the answer. Treating today’s vast universe of online SDG hubs and platforms as unique and independent, while bringing in place the backbone infrastructure and protocols that enable aggregation and content exchange can be a solution.

Efforts, such as the UN’s API Highways initiative, are great first steps, yet more needs to happen to make it easy and worthwhile for online platforms all over the world to feed into and contribute to a shared backbone. A joining of forces between smaller specialist sustainable solution providers and tech giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, or Google – given their existing reach, platform strength, and ability to set standards – will be important.

3. (Wise) use of frontier technologies

Exacerbated by a scarcity of tech expertise and financial resources, we would argue that the role of technology as a lever of change is underutilized and often an inhibitor to impact when solutions are ineffectively implemented or managed. This is equally true for the use of established technologies and those that have emerged as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or blockchain.

Large companies are showing the way forward here. We seeing blockchain used to promote sustainability goals, with examples such as Coca-Cola’s work with the US State Department on forced labour or Unilever and Sainsbury’s work with tea smallholders. Much can be done to take advantage of these frontier technologies as well as “bread and butter” technologies to establish a decentralized, disintermediating and more intelligent SDG environment that includes greater transparency, efficiency and decentralized data ownership.

Multiple “tech for good” coalitions (e.g. Consensys’ Blockchain for Social Impact and UNDP’s Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development) have begun to explore ways to do so. Such coalitions have an important role to play in building the right bridges between tech and sustainability, surfacing tech solutions that actually work and – especially in a world of blockchain mania – maintain a sense of realism while ‘SDG coins’ pop up left and right.

4. Human-centred design

Deep engagement, collaboration or investment is rarely the result of technology alone. Effective solutions require the integration of both human and tech factors. Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab put his finger on this when he stated that: “In the end, it all comes down to people and values. We need to shape a future that works for all of us by putting people first and empowering them.”

Putting this design principle at the heart of all development efforts and ensuring that a cadre of leaders and individuals stands that is fluent in both tech and sustainability are involved is important.

5. A pooling of resources

An important inhibitor of the use of technology in support of the SDGs has been a lack of resources or, as some argue, insufficient investment in an infrastructure to enable its use. While the tide has begun to turn, the capital that is available (grant or investment) to bring in the right solutions has not been at the level required to truly unblock the system.

This is not surprising: a number of failed platforms and the need for a long investment horizon to achieve the financial returns on such solutions make many hesitant to commit. Our solution? Pool efforts to bring the capital and non-financial resources together that are needed to support those solutions that collectively lead to the standards and decentralized, interoperable systems so critical for SDG success.

To deliver on this plan, the UN has a unique role to play in “corralling the troops” in support of a shared SDG tech agenda or blueprint, but also in getting providers and partners to adhere to open architecture protocols and standards. Governments and philanthropic institutions with an interest in stimulating collaboration and private sector investment in the SDGs must do the same and support solutions that contribute to a more navigable system.

To individual platforms we say: don’t build a new platform when the need to do so is not clear. And, when you do, use the systems that already exist – which is the case nine times out of 10 – and align to the protocols that enable an exchange of content.","Despite the momentum that’s been built, the standards, tools and systems required to facilitate individual and collective action are often missing.

173,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-apparition-a-curious-exploration-of-doubt-and-faith,"Fri, 07 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Apparition’: A Curious Exploration of Doubt and Faith,"Has the Virgin Mary really spoken to a young girl in rural France? A French-language film offers an earnest look at how the hierarchy and the faithful respond to a purported visionary.

Xavier Giannoli’s The Apparition joins Jessica Hausner’s 2009 Lourdes and Dietrich Brüggemann’s Stations of the Cross on a short list of 21st-century European films turning a curious eye on devout Catholic piety in an increasingly secular world.

Like Stations of the Cross, The Apparition focuses on a deeply devout young girl, a mystic who may be a victim soul, chosen by God to suffer for the benefit of others. Like Lourdes, the protagonist is a skeptic caught up in a popular Marian phenomenon, wondering if miracles really happen.

Vincent Lindon plays Jacques Mayano, a renowned investigative journalist who receives an unexpected call from the Vatican.

An official at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wants Jacques to take part in a canonical investigation into a purported Marian apparition and the devotion that has grown around the visionary, a young novice named Anna (Galatéa Bellugi).

As practically every important word in that last sentence must be explained to him, Jacques may seem an unusual choice. But he is a man in need of direction — he’s reeling from the loss of his best friend and photographer in a violent incident on assignment in the Middle East — and takes the job.

Lourdes touched on the question of authenticating miracles, but The Apparition focuses on the Church’s investigative process to a greater degree than any film I’ve seen. (The film to which it most begs comparison or contrast might be Agnieszka Holland’s 1999 film The Third Miracle, starring Ed Harris, unseen by me.)

Jacques’ fellow investigators include a genial theologian, Stéphane Mornay (Gérard Dessalles), who makes no secret of his skepticism of the Medjugorje visionaries as well as Anna’s purported visions, and a psychiatrist, Dr. de Villeneuve (Elina Löwensohn), whose function is to assess Anna’s psychological well-being but who clearly wants to believe in Anna’s miracle.

De Villeneuve isn’t the only one. Anna’s spiritual guide and mentor, a Franciscan priest named Father Borrodine (Patrick d’Assumçao), is so devoted to his young charge and her calling that he has gone off the reservation against the local bishop, despite the suspension of his faculties to say Mass.

There’s also an ingratiatingly earnest Catholic media figure named Anton Meyer (Anatole Taubman) whose celebration of Anna is at once exploitative and utterly sincere. And, of course, there are the throngs of pilgrims flocking to glimpse the visionary and the sight of the apparition, and also, of course, to buy religious trinkets: rosaries, crucifixes, statues of Mary, even votive candles with stickers of Anna’s face.

Anna herself appears to have no wish for celebrity. She has a transparent, self-possessed quality that suggests genuineness and candor. Her message from the Blessed Virgin is simple: Mary hears the cries of the world and wants people to learn to give to one another, to help the poor and suffering. She also wants Anna to have a house of prayer built for her Son, presumably at the site of the apparition.

As a novice, Anna works with the sisters making feather bedding to support the convent, and when necessary, she offers simple, sincere words to the crowds who come to see her. After her interview with the investigative team, in a moment witnessed neither by Jacques nor any other human being, she kneels in composed prayer on a restroom floor: a token of the authenticity of her faith.

Later, after a televised interview with Meyer, we see Anna kneeling again in solitary prayer, this time on a chapel floor — but her very different posture suggests a sense of desperate pleading. One of Meyer’s questions for Anna was how she felt about Christians from all over the world coming to see her. At times Anna’s celebrity may feel like a life sentence with no hope of parole.

There are suggestions of something possibly hinky about Anna’s story. One of the most notable is a purported relic of Jesus — a bloodstained shroud that Anna is said to have received directly from the Blessed Virgin.

Stéphane, the theologian, calls this “a total contradiction with the tradition of apparitions,” since, he says, Mary “has always been an image of love, kindness and understanding. She can’t be associated with violence.”

Stéphane’s reasoning is simultaneously understated and wrong. On the one hand, Mary is certainly associated with her Son’s passion and death. (Beyond that, sacred art is full of images of the Blessed Virgin crushing the serpent’s head and even beating up the devil.)

On the other hand, what Stéphane should have said is that Marian apparitions do not traditionally dispense physical relics. St. Juan Diego’s tilma was miraculously marked with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, but the tilma itself was made of Mexican hemp like any number of tilmas worn by Juan Diego’s contemporaries.

Resisting Stéphane’s skepticism, de Villeneuve suggests that the cloth may be “a new symbol.” The theological implications of this suggestion aren’t explored; more glaringly, no one asks just how many bloodstained shrouds of Jesus there can be.

Scientific tests suggest a connection, of a sort, to the Shroud of Turin and the Shroud of Oviedo (or Sudarium), as well as the Holy Tunic of Argenteuil. Those three relics aren’t in competition — the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium are considered complementary relics that covered the same person — but it’s hard to see how Anna’s shroud could be added to the mix.

All of this is greatly complicated by Jacques’ investigation into Anna’s complex back story: the foster families she lived with, a friend named Meriem (Alicia Hava), whom Anna knew from her foster care days, a grisly murder, a man in prison, and more.

These subplots take up too much time for too little payoff. By the time Jacques comes face-to-face with a person who has, in a way, the most crucial story to tell, neither the film nor its protagonist have the time or interest to really explore that story or that character.

The resolution is clever, giving both secular and religious viewers something to hold onto, but unsatisfying in giving short shrift to the final piece of its complicated puzzle.

The story is also, to an extent, about Jacques’s working through his grief and depression from the killing of his friend. The opening shots of a close hotel room with heavy room-darkening curtains drawn against the Middle-Eastern sun suggest the isolation and oppressive narrowness of depression. The final image, a wide outdoor shot with the protagonist standing in an immense Middle-Eastern landscape, conveys liberation and open possibilities.

Along the way, there’s a suggestion that perhaps Mary takes an interest in Jacques’s healing and sends him an enigmatic message of hope. Does the Blessed Mother see, or is she blind? The Apparition answers many questions, but remains agnostic on that one.

Deacon Steven D. Greydanus is the Register’s film critic and creator of Decent Films.

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

One of the targets of SDG12 is support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production

AIF presented the most convincing concept on SDG 12 indicating a practical cooperation venture between the government of Rwanda, consortium of various banks, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in this area.

AIF Rwanda is a leading manufacturer of high quality and nutritious complementary foods in Rwanda, and a joint-venture between government and a consortium of Royal DSM, Dutch development bank (FMO), DFID Impact Acceleration Facility managed by CDC Group plc and International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.

“We are very honored and proud to have received the SDG Award of the Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES) for the first time ever,” AIF Rwanda said in a twitter statement.

Along with the award, AIF Rwanda also received prize money of 4,000 Swiss francs from which Amar Ali, CEO of AIF donated 4,000 Swiss Francs to orphans living in Mbuye Sector, Ruhango district, Kizibere village.

“We were impressed by the way in which Africa Improved Foods combines its social commitment with the successful networking of public and private players,” says Dr. Anne le Duc, CEO of SGES, upon announcing the first award winner.

On May 31, 2017, AIF opened its state-of-the-art facility in the city of Kigali, where it produces an annual output of 45,000 tonnes of fortified blended foods, employing over 300 staff.

The company offers 24,000 Rwandan farmers sustainable income for a proportion of their harvest.

Its first two products are porridge flours with added milk powder, vitamins, and minerals.

The factory recently celebrated its first anniversary and will soon have the capacity to feed two million people and be able to reduce stunting in Rwanda from 38% to 32% by 2020 – a 6% reduction – bringing hope to tens of thousands of children.

AIF Rwanda was this April named among the finalists of the 2018 World Changing Ideas Awards (WCIA), in the food category among the 12 companies awarded in areas of health, technology, consumer products, energy, transport and education.

The publication describes the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs, and showcases examples of WIPO’s contributions to the SDGs.



SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) explicitly recognizes the link between economic and social progress and innovation. In the publication’s introduction, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry elaborates on the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs. He states that intellectual property as a policy “exists to create an enabling environment for – and to stimulate investment in – innovation,” and to create a framework for sharing and trading new technologies around the world. He further explains that the “economic imperative at the heart of innovation is fundamental to the process of societal transformation that the SDGs aim to achieve.

A WIPO-led partnership seeks to ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations are not neglected.

The publication titled, ‘WIPO and the Sustainable Development Goals: Innovation Driving Human Progress,’ highlights the role of innovation in achieving the SDGs, including SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action). On SDG 3, the report explains how intellectual property systems support health care innovation by encouraging investment in new drugs and technologies while reassuring companies of a secure return on their investment. To ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations or that affect comparatively few people are not neglected, WIPO leads a public-private partnership (PPP) to tackle neglected tropical diseases, malaria and tuberculosis.

On SDG 4 (quality education), WIPO works with its member States to support equal access to education, such as by implementing treaty-based adjustments to the intellectual property systems, so that books for visually-impaired people can be more easily shared across national borders. The WIPO-led ‘Accessible Books Consortium’ works to harness technologies to produce books for visually impaired people globally. This PPP established international standards for inclusive publishing. and facilitates inter-library loans across borders.

On SDG 13, WIPO highlights its efforts to promote an efficient global market for environmentally friendly technologies, building the international intellectual property system. WIPO GREEN aims to stimulate the uptake of green tech by bringing innovators, investors and potential users together. The network facilitates connections between companies looking to access, commercialize or license a green technology with the innovators who create such a technology.

The publication showcases a new water technology called CloudFisher that provides clean water to communities in arid but foggy coastal or mountainous regions that face water shortages. WIPO GREEN facilitated a connection between the technology’s developer and the company that commercialized it.

In addition to WIPO’s direct impacts on several SDGs, the report argues that the role of innovation in policy setting can assist in achieving SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 8, SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land), among others.

Agroforestry has the strongest impact potential on poverty reduction (SDG 1) and hunger alleviation (SDG 2), as well as on climate action (SDG 13), and biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management (SDG 15). In addition, the report shows that agroforestry can contribute to other goals by improving gender equality (SDG 5) and health (SDG 3), as well as by increasing access to clean water (SDG 6), sustainable energy solutions (SDG 7), and responsible agricultural production (SDG 12).

The report builds on an extensive literature review of 1,000 scientific publications and other reports about practical agroforestry projects. The authors present environmental, social and economic benefits of agroforestry at the farmer, community and landscape levels. Special attention is paid to the benefits agroforestry brings to food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and biodiversity.

The sukuk aims to finance projects that benefit the environment and communities, and is the first sukuk issuance by a financial institution that references the SDGs as the beneficiary of the proceeds.



Proceeds from the sukuk will be used as working capital in HSBC’s Amanah’s Islamic banking business to finance eligible projects and businesses in line with HSBC’s SDG Bond Framework. The Framework supports projects contributing to SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action).

HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Milne, explained that the sukuk demonstrates Malaysia’s role as an Islamic finance hub and HSBC’s “leadership in sustainable financing.” UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Achim Steiner welcomed HSBC’s commitment to using funds raised in the capital market to invest in the SDGs. He observed that “HSBC’s pioneering ‘SDG sukuk’ is a prime example of how to create innovative financing for the Goals,” and represents a milestone in aligning the SDGs and Islamic finance.

About HSBC Amanah’s SDG sukuk



On 20 September 2018, HSBC Amanah priced an offering of RM500 million for a senior unsecured fixed rate SDG sukuk, due in 2023, from its existing multi-currency sukuk programme of RM3.0 billion. The sukuk is rated AAA by RAM Rating Services Berhad and proceeds will be utilised for working capital in the ordinary course of HSBC Amanah’s Islamic banking business, to finance eligible businesses and projects in accordance with the HSBC Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Bond Framework.

HSBC Amanah, RHB Islamic Bank Berhad and Maybank Investment Bank Berhad acted as joint lead managers on this transaction while HSBC Amanah acted as the sole lead arranger and sole SDG structuring adviser. The offering received strong investor demand, with final orderbooks in excess of MYR1.4 billion and a bid to cover ratio of 2.85x from 25 accounts across government agencies and pension funds (51%), financial institutions (31%), insurance companies (9%), asset managers (8%), and corporates (1%).



The sukuk priced at the tight end of the final price guidance at a fixed profit rate of 4.30% per annum from an initial price guidance of 4.30%-4.40%.

Accompanying reports on the Task Force’s activities highlight interlinkages among actions directed at addressing climate change-related displacement and achieving the SDGs.

The Task Force was established following a request by the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the UNFCCC to the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM). The Task Force presented its report to the eighth ExCom meeting, which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 18-21 September 2018.

The Task Force report, inter alia: provides the contextual background in which the recommendations were developed; summarizes the technical outputs of the Task Force’s activities; and links to more detailed reports of those activities, which were undertaken in collaboration with other UN agencies and international organizations.

The WIM ExCom set up the Task Force in March 2017 to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change, in accordance with the mandate to the WIM from COP 21. To provide input to the recommendations, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) organized a stakeholder meeting from 14-15 May 2018 in Bogis-Bossey, Switzerland, which brought together Task Force members and those working on the human mobility and climate change nexus. The recommendations will be presented at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, and are directed to the ExCom, UNFCCC and Paris Agreement constituted bodies, Parties, UN agencies, relevant organizations and other stakeholders. They are elaborated in a PDD-produced report, which looks at the evolution of the UN’s response to climate change and disaster displacement, current UN institutional frameworks and mandates for displacement related to climate change, and coordinating integrated approaches to disaster displacement associated with climate change.

While the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs provide several entry points.

The Task Force report also includes summaries of its activities, which are elaborated in longer accompanying reports, produced by the lead agencies/organizations for that specific activity.

For example, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) produced a detailed report on the mapping of existing international and regional guidance and tools, including those related to averting displacement related to climate change, which highlights, inter alia:

The Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI), which delivers capacity development services in risk reduction to support national efforts to achieve the SDGs;

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) SDGs Assessment Tool, which helps assess the contributions of climate action to the SDGs, and compiles information about the impacts of climate action, including displacement and resettlement, to feed into progress reports on nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and SDG implementation; and

The ‘Global Migration Group Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ which includes guidance to producers and users of international migration data and is expected to contribute directly to monitoring SDG implementation.

[Publication: Mapping of Existing International and Regional Guidance and Tools on Averting, Minimizing, Addressing and Facilitating Durable Solutions to Displacement Related to the Adverse Impacts of Climate Change]

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) produced a report titled, ‘Mapping Human Mobility and Climate Change in International Processes, Policies and Legal Frameworks,’ which focuses on, inter alia, migration, displacement and planned relocation, as well as human rights and international labor standards. The report highlights, among other instruments, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which makes the link between climate change, disasters, environmental degradation, migration and achieving the SDGs.

It also suggests that, while the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs provide several entry points related to targets under SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action).

DESA aims to launch the network in April 2019.



Providing opening remarks, DESA head Liu Zhenmin highlighted projected investment needs to meet the ambition of the SDGs, estimated at US$5-7 trillion per year. He cautioned that “the bulk of the required investment will need to be long-term,” and therefore the challenge is to engage actors that can provide such finance at scale, such as pension funds.

DESA envisions replicating the Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development (SISD) network at global level. The global network would align with the UN Secretary-General’s Financing Strategy, which was released in September 2019. It is intended to complement the SDG Investment Fair, which also was launched recently, and the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum).

As part of our Mission Possible campaign, edie brings you this weekly round-up of five of the best sustainability success stories of the week from across the globe.

Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their 'Mission Possible' across the campaign’s five key pillars - energy, resources, mobility, built environment and business leadership.

From a green buildings initiative in Singapore to a huge new energy storage plant in Scotland, each of these projects and initiatives is empowering businesses and governments to achieve a sustainable future, today.

ENERGY: Planning permission for huge battery storage facility in Scotland approved

A recent Bloomberg New Energy Finance study predicted that the global energy storage market will double six times by 2030. Domestically, the early signs are encouraging, with the UK’s largest storage portfolio carried out in June by UK Power Reserve and energy storage firm Fluence.

In the latest storage success story, UK energy technology firm Pivot Power this week gained planning permission to build a new 50MW battery facility in Harker, near Carlisle.

Once complete in October 2019, the 25-container facility is expected to be able to store enough energy to power 6,000 homes for a 24-hour period on a single full charge. It will be co-located with an electric vehicle (EV) charging facility, which will have sufficient infrastructure to charge up to 100 vehicles at a time.

“Working with the local authorities, our plans will see Carlisle become a pioneering city for low carbon vehicle adoption, ensuring that the rural areas it serves are not left lagging in the electric vehicle revolution,"" Pivot Power’s chief technical officer Michael Clarke said.

RESOURCES: Everlane launches closed-loop clothing line made from recycled plastics

From Adidas’ ocean plastic trainers to Corona’s recycled beach bottle shirt, more and more companies are moving to design garments incorporating a high proportion of recycled content. Following in the footsteps of The North Face, which last month unveiled a range of products made from littered PET bottles, US fashion retailer Everlane the week launched a range of outerwear made with post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic.

The fleeces, jackets and coats, which went on sale in the chain’s US stores and on its website on Wednesday (24 October), each contain the equivalent of at least 15 recycled drinks bottles – with the full-length puffa jackets containing the equivalent of 60.

The launch of the range, called ReNew, comes after Everlane pledged earlier this year to remove all virgin plastic from its supply chain by 2021. In a bid to raise awareness of the importance of plastic recycling, Everlane has also launched a web page which tells customers how many virgin plastic bottles have been made in the time they spend on the site.

MOBILITY: Norwegian Air to cut CO2 emissions by 16,000 tonnes annually using AI

Sustainable aviation has proven to be something of a hot topic this month, with Virgin Atlantic showcasing its innovative low-carbon jet fuel made from recycled waste gases for the first time and Heathrow Airport moving to waive landing charges for the world's first electric passenger plane once it is developed.

The latest success story in the sector comes from budget airline Norwegian Air, which has started rolling out fuel efficiency technology across its fleet after a trial resulted in fuel savings of 22 kilos per journey.

Called Aventus Air and developed by Swedish firm AVTECH, the technology monitors wind and temperature information to enable pilots to alter their flight paths to boost fuel efficiency. Once the data is collected, it is automatically sent to the aircraft’s systems, where artificial intelligence (AI) is used to optimise the flight path.

Norwegian Air estimates that by installing the software across its entire fleet of 160 aircraft, it will reduce its carbon emissions by 16,000 tonnes each year. The company has already reduced its absolute emissions by almost one-third (30%) since 2008.

THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: 1,000 built environment sector professionals collaborate to help tackle smart cities challenges

Cities currently account for around 70% of the global energy demand and will be home to 2.5 billion more people by 2050 than they are today.

As cities around the world explore ways to integrate technological solutions and innovations that ensure they’ll remain fit for purpose as urbanisation continues, 1,000 built environment sector workers this week gathered to explore how cities could align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Meeting in Singapore for an event called the SDG City Challenge (SDGCC) and led by real estate firm City Developments Limited Group (CDL), participants from big-name corporations and governmental organisations debated how cities could best align their development with all 17 of the Global Goals, ensuring no residents were left behind by climate challenges or social inequalities.

“We believe that a sustainable built environment will provide high-quality spaces for people to live, work and play,” CDL’s chief executive Sherman Kwek said.

“Through SDGCC, we hope to encourage participants to adopt the SDGs in their daily lives and better understand how healthy lifestyles, green buildings and eco-friendly practices are intricately connected for a sustainable future.”

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP: Big-name businesses jointly pledge $500,000 to spur action on SDGs

In the wake of UN research revealing that there is currently a $2.5trn “investment gap” between the level of funding currently earmarked for clean growth in developing countries and the amount needed to achieve all 17 SDGs in full, nine corporations this week collectively pledged to invest $500,000 into projects which aim to accelerate global progress on one or more of the Goals.

As part of a new initiative called Lead2030 and led by UK-based non-profit One Young World, RB, AstraZeneca, Deloitte, Credit Suisse, BP, Standard Chartered, Mondi Group, KPMG and Bristol-Myers Squibb have each pledged to invest $50,000 in a project which is already working to address a Global Goal related to that firm’s sector.

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”.

The funding will support countries in Africa and Asia to prevent wildlife poaching and illegal wildlife trade and help countries to reduce consumer demand for species and their products.

According to the GEF, there is an urgent need to tackle wildlife crime. Leopards are extinct in 23 out of the 89 African and Asian countries where they originally lived, and only four percent of tigers remain in the wild. In Africa, the numbers of African elephant and black rhino are “plummeting.” Birds, pangolins, primates, sharks, turtles and other species are all facing severe pressure from wildlife trade.

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the “most lucrative illegal businesses in the world,” generating between US$7 billion to 23 billion per year. This crime contributes to corruption and conflicts and deprives local communities of natural capital and opportunities to benefit from nature-based tourism. The GEF estimates that crimes affecting natural resources “cost societies more than US$70 billion a year.”

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the most lucrative illegal businesses in the world.

The GEF is working to tackle wildlife crime through its Global Wildlife Programme (GWP), which works in 19 African and Asian countries. The partnership focuses on wildlife conservation and crime prevention for sustainable development and is funded by the GEF and led by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). The increased funding will broaden the partnership’s reach and impact and help countries to take their own measures to tackle illegal wildlife trade.

The GEF has allocated a total of US$168 million to combat wildlife trafficking during its GEF-7 funding cycle, which runs from 2018-2022. The GEF announced this increased funding in advance of the ‘Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference,’ an event hosted by the Government of the UK. The event aims to combat wildlife trade as a serious organized crime, close markets for wildlife species and products and build coalitions to deliver change.

185,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/addressing-sdg-5-5-steps-to-promote-gender-equality-in-the-supply-chain,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 5: 5 Steps to Promote Gender Equality in the Supply Chain,"In 2015, the world got one step closer to a better future when 193 countries committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a framework for addressing the global community’s most critical economic, social and environmental challenges. These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Specifically, SDG 5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and should be a critical consideration for global supply chains, as there’s tremendous opportunity to make an impact. Women hold 60 to 90 percent of global supply chain jobs, particularly in the apparel and agricultural sectors, and represent the majority of workers in low-wage jobs in the lower tiers of the value chain. Despite their prevalent role, women lack access to social protection measures, especially maternity protection, and face limited career opportunities.

There are five steps companies in all industries and sizes can take to reap the benefits of gender equality in the supply chain.

1. Increase transparency with better metrics and reporting.

Setting up meaningful and accurate metrics and goals, appropriate to the size and sector of the organization, is key for quality reporting, which in the end means more transparency into sustainable progress. When teams have the right metrics for evaluating where the company and its suppliers stand on gender equality, it’s easier to set targets, measure success and benchmark performance against competition.

Start with the most basic key performance indicators (KPIs), such as gender ratio across various roles and the corresponding level of remuneration. GRI G4 standards provide robust reporting frameworks for gender equality and diversity.

2. Prioritize robust policies and programs.

If policies and programs to tackle gender inequality don’t exist in your supply chain, it is high time to design and implement them. When gender equality is weaved into the management system and this foundation for progress is in place, the next step is to prioritize gender-related programs. For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth. The cosmetics giant has put forward a sustainable sourcing program that specifically addresses the vulnerability of women when it comes to climate change. The cumulative effects of poverty, cultural and social barriers, exacerbated by climate change, put the health, wellbeing and livelihood of women at great risk. L’Oréal is addressing this critical issue through research and regional programs that empower women and help them diversify their income, and by supporting external initiatives such as Women4Climate, designed to create sustainable and inclusive communities.

A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality. One key step is to support female entrepreneurs or companies with a mission to fight gender inequality. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that in 2018 there are 30 percent more male entrepreneurs in the world and that women make up only 40 percent of the new entrepreneurs in the U.S. This makes it even more imperative to support the existing 200 million female business owners worldwide and encourage growth of female entrepreneurship across the globe. A company can send a strong message by selecting suppliers with effective gender-specific policies and programs in place. This is especially relevant for the retail and agricultural sectors, where low-tier workers are predominantly women.

4. Benefit from global expertise.

Demonstrate commitment to global goals and gender parity by partnering with leading organizations and joining key initiatives. As robust as gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs may be, there’s a lot to be gained by formally endorsing worldwide initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and HeForShe’s IMPACT 10x10x10 framework, or joining other national or local initiatives. Participating in well-established initiatives offers the chance to dip into a network of global experts on critical subjects and access best practices and tools that that can break through barriers to gender equality in your own operations and throughout your global supply chain.

5. Educate and train suppliers.

Forced and child labor is firmly on the agenda of most large corporations. However, few acknowledge the vulnerability of girls and women to modern slavery: Females constitute 99 percent of victims in the commercial industry and 58 percent in other sectors. By eliminating forced and child labor in your supply chain, you strongly contribute to achieving SDG 5. Engaging suppliers is key here — selecting only pre-qualified suppliers, continuous monitoring and training of existing suppliers, and engaging them in the conversation about gender parity and your vision of a fair and equal workplace are the most fundamental steps to have in place.

The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues. However, gender is an inalienable component of every other global goal. Educating girls and preventing child marriage helps eliminate global poverty, and full and equal participation of girls and women in global politics will definitely bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which the SDGs support.","These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

An accompanying symposium offered countries the opportunity to share national progress on statistics for implementing the SDGs and Agenda 2063 and to discuss regional indicators for the two agendas.



Heads of national statistics offices (NSOs) from 51 African countries, representatives from international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, academia and research institutions and the private sector attended StatCom-Africa VI, which took place on the theme, ‘Enhancing the Capacity of National Statistical Systems to support policies for Africa’s economic diversification and industrialization.’ Participants identified the importance of national ownership, adequate resources and adequate resources for the region to support statistical transformation initiatives. They called for States to support the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the 2020 round of housing and population censuses.

In a keynote address, Vincent Hendricks, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reflected that scientists do not typically like to sell themselves or their products, believing that their value is “self-evident,” but he said “it doesn’t work that way” in reality. He urged statisticians to realize that they “are the experts and not the politicians” and they should use their data “for the good of their communities.” He called for taking ownership of their data and using it to change their communities, advance democracy and help African governments promote evidence-based policymaking.

The meeting also reflected on key challenges faced by NSOs, including enhancing the capacity of statistical systems and aligning statistics with global, regional and national development agendas. Participants underscored the role of creative and innovative approaches to overcome challenges, and called for all stakeholders to collaborate to meet the growing demand for data to inform and implement development agendas. Participants also supported disaggregating indicators for monitoring basic human rights as a way to address inequalities, and investing in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system.

The Director of the African Centre for Statistics (ACS), Oliver Chinganya, presented the ACS’ proposed strategic framework for the 2018-2019 biennium. The framework aims to “improve the production, dissemination and use of quality data and statistics” within the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. He said the Centre is working to support the design of national strategies on statistics, dissemination of information and best practices and production of harmonized statistics.

Participants took note of the statistical programme and urged UNECA to continue supporting States in building their statistical capacity in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ABCF).

Also within the StatCom-Africa VI meeting, the 13th session of the African Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 3-4 October 2018. The symposium focused on the theme, ‘Application of economic statistics and national accounts in support of sustainable development.’ Countries shared progress and challenges in statistical development in line with the SDGs, with some reporting on how their countries have aligned national development plans with the SDGs.

Others highlighted a lack of data to support SDG indicators. A representative for South Africa said that his country lacks data to compile economic indicators to support monitoring of targets under SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The ‘My Fiji Shark Initiative’ aims to promote the use of traditional knowledge, science and technology to advance sustainable management and marine conservation in the Pacific.



The initiative aims to change public perception of sharks, which Natasha Marosi, BAD, described as “beautiful, intelligent and dynamic creatures” with individual personalities. Marosi explained that sharks are globally threatened by habitat loss and overfishing, and “deserve all the help they can get.”

The initiative is all the more important as it targets SDG financing from – and with – the private sector.

The initiative is collaborating with the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, which is managed by BAD, to increase the profile of marine conservation in the Pacific through a shark adoption programme. The initiative enables sponsors to “adopt” individual sharks in their natural habitat. There are seven different tiers of public adoption levels, ranging from US$50 to US$10,000. Revenues generated from the initiative will support shark conservation measures, create new shark conservation and inshore fisheries management programmes, and build an independent Shark Lab to conduct shark conservation research in Fiji, among other activities.

UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji Country Director, Bakhodir Burkhanov, emphasized that the initiative “is all the more important as it targets SDG financing from – and with – the private sector.” He underscored the importance of private sector engagement and financial support in achieving the SDGs.

The Government of Australia provided financial support for the initiative. The initiative is expected to contribute to the Government of Fiji’s fisheries management and marine conservation goals.

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

We focus particularly on knowledge offerings relating to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 10 (reduced inequalities).

Technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems, according to WDR 2019.

The World Development Report (WDR) 2019, released during the meetings by the World Bank Group, focuses on “the changing nature of work,” particularly in the face of technological advances and fears that automation will replace employees with machines. The publication asserts that such fears are unfounded, noting that technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems. It considers issues raised by automation and digitization vis-à-vis businesses, and reviews how these impacts can be harnessed to promote social protection and inclusion, describing the idea of a new social contract. A summary blog on the report is also available. The report also presents the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which was formally launched in Bali. A World Bank press release notes that “jobs of the future require more investment in people.”

However, Sophie Edwards reports on Devex that civil society responses to the WDR have been less than positive, due to “a strong deregulatory thrust” and “attacks on many basic work rights” in a world where “technology is pushing down the value of labor in the economy.” Edwards notes that in a side session during the annual meetings, World Bank staff painted an optimistic scenario where new opportunities are created, but flagged that the poorest citizens and informal workers may not be able access those new jobs without increases in social protections from governments.

Also exploring fears of negative impacts on employment, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive Development released a report titled, ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth: From paralysis to preparation.’ The report examines the impact of technological innovation on growth, jobs and livelihoods, recognizing that “technologies are radically transforming peoples’ lives.” It explores whether frontier technologies such as machine learning will indeed benefit the world’s poorest. The Commission finds that estimates of job losses due to automation—which range from 9-80%—are misleading because the methodologies behind them tend to “ignore the upsides of technological progress” that often result in new opportunities. The report identifies five pathways that developing counties can pursue to ensure inclusive growth: 1) raising value from agriculture; 2) new global value chains in manufacturing; 3) global trade in services; 4) linking the informal sector to the formal economy; and 5) diverse, connected domestic economies that reduce costs and increase innovation. Across these pathways, the Commission underscores the need to create “a digital-ready country” that guides markets towards innovation through broad support for entrepreneurs and maximizes inclusiveness by ensuring a level playing field. The Commission is hosted by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.

Shanta Devarajan, Acting Chief Economist of the World Bank, compares the two publications above – ‘The Changing Nature of Work’ and ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth’ – in a post on The Brookings Institution’s blog titled, ‘the future of inclusive growth.’ Devarajan notes that both paint “an optimistic picture of the impact of technology on developing countries” and “provide a robust platform for harnessing the power of technology for inclusive growth.” Each report, he explains, addresses the impacts of technology on inequality, noting that efficiency gains outlined in the Pathways report can benefit poorer segments of society. He writes that farmers, who tend to have comparatively low incomes, could benefit from improved crop yields driven by data analytics and biotechnology. However, he cautions that the WDR articulates a blurring of firms’ boundaries, changing production patterns and employment trajectories.

Turning to SDG 10, Development Finance International (DFI) and Oxfam launched the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2018. The index, which assesses governments by their initiatives to bridge the gap between rich and poor, focuses on efforts in three policy areas: social spending, progressive taxation, and higher wages and stronger labor rights for workers (particularly women). This second edition builds on the 2017’s “beta version,” adding new sub-indicators in the tax and labor categories. Top overall performers include Denmark, Germany and Finland, while laggards are Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Haiti. However, the findings stress that all of the 157 countries it covers “could do more, even those near the top.”

IBON International published a paper, titled, ‘Implementing the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): Reinforcing Corporate Capture of the Global South.’ The piece looks into the implementation of the MFD model in Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, and articulates a need to move beyond this approach. The authors argue that the systematization of private actors in the model poses risks to peoples’ right to participate in development. They cite a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report that finds “differences in private and social returns” of “bankable” projects under the MFD approach, and call for national development strategies to “be owned and led by the people… whose rights to land, social services and to development are at stake.”

On financing poverty eradication more broadly, Development Initiatives launched ‘Investments to End Poverty 2018’ during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The report explores ways of strengthening aid amidst a “rapidly changing development finance landscape,” the mobilization of all resources to leave no one behind, and moving from data to impact through increased transparency. The executive summary emphasizes that business as usual leaves people behind, and that urgent action is needed to change trajectories on meeting aid commitments and identifying the synergies between difference resources. It highlights growing global inequality, lamenting that that the world’s poorest are “falling further and further behind,” that information provision has not kept pace with the need for disaggregated data, and that investments must be made to ensure both wellbeing and economic potential, such as social protection, health and education.

Finally, as noted above, the World Bank launched its Human Capital Index, one pillar of the Human Capital Project, which aims to raise awareness on lack of investments in “human capital,” which encompasses peoples’ skills, health, knowledge, and resilience. Investing in these areas can enable increased productivity, flexibility and innovation, and can act as “a central driver of sustainable growth and poverty reduction,” the authors argue. The Index reviews five indicators on health and education that can be linked to productivity as an adult, in order to arrive at an aggregate score between 0 and 1. As noted by Devex, Singapore tops the list with a score of 0.88. The Human Capital Summit was held on 11 October 2018, in the margins of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

A report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, ‘Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them,’ examines why some emerging economies have grown faster and more consistently than others. The report examines 71 developing economies and identifies two factors that help explain their “outperformance”: a policy agenda that promotes growth, and the role of large companies. Among other findings, the authors highlight changes in the global landscape on demographics, trade patterns and the digital revolution, which they note provide new opportunities in both manufacturing and services.

The side event served as the launch of UNEP’s Global Plastics Platform, which will encourage and support commitments to reduce plastic pollution.

Frans Timmermans, European Commission, opened the event held at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018. He said plastic pollution has gained widespread attention, but regulation is still needed. Referring to the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, adopted in early 2018, he said the EU plans to make plastics more circular and to ban them where there are feasible consumer alternatives.

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle urged participants to “rethink the whole problem of single-use, throwaway goods,” as recycling “only marks the start of another problem.”

Erik Solheim, UN Environment Executive Director, said the economic threat of plastic pollution can become an opportunity. He said UN Environment has established a Global Plastics Platform, which will support countries and cities in establishing policies to reduce plastic pollution. UN Environment notes that in 2018, a number of countries announced plans to ban single-use plastics: India said it will ban all single-use plastic by 2022; Botswana, Chile and Peru announced plastic bag bans; Nigeria revealed plans to establish recycling plants across the country; and Brazil announced a national plan on plastics.

In addition to policy support, the Platform will explore ways to change the design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, in line with a transition to a more circular economy. UN Environment reports that such efforts will include identifying opportunities to reduce economic and industrial waste. The Platform will build on and advance the World Economic Forum-hosted Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, the work of the Regional Seas Conventions, and other existing initiatives and partnerships.

UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

Susan Goldberg, National Geographic, moderated a panel with heads of state and ministers from Aruba, Canada, Colombia, Iceland, Norway and Rwanda, as well as business leaders in retail and waste management. Officials from other countries spoke from the floor. Speakers highlighted several commitments, policies and initiatives, including on single-use plastics:

Aruba will ban all single-use plastics by 2020, following its 2016 ban on single-use plastic bags;

Spain will ban plastic bags in 2021;

Rwanda has drafted a law banning single-use plastics, following its 2008 ban on plastic bags;

Norway is considering a ban on single-use plastics in coordination with the EU;

Kenya is working with the East African Community to extend its plastic bag ban to other countries;

Sweden and Costa Rica are working to reduce single-use plastics at the UN and in its missions, including through sustainable procurement practices;

Costa Rica has a national strategy to replace single-use plastics with renewable and combustible alternatives; and

Iceland places a recycling fee on plastic goods.

Canada banned the sale of microbeads in 2018, and Iceland is developing a policy on microplastics. Norway is establishing a producer responsibility scheme for discarded fishing gear. In Iceland, discarded fishing gear can be traced to its owner.

Colombia is implementing a strategy for packaging and packaging waste. The country expects to make use of 30% of its waste by 2030, and is managing waste through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The world’s fourth largest retailer, the Schwarz Group, is developing a strategy to reduce and recycle all of its packaging. Spain is finalizing a circular economy strategy called España Circular 2030, which will include plastic pollution measures.

In addition, Norway launched a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy on 24 September 2018, which will report in 2020. Norway also provided the initial pledge to the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund to support healthy and productive oceans, including by tackling marine pollution.

Almost all speakers underlined the need to engage the public and key stakeholders in order for the policies to succeed. Aruba’s Prime Minister noted that people resisted the 2016 ban on plastic bags, because the government had not worked to raise awareness before the policy change. She said that in preparation for the 2020 ban, officials have involved stakeholders to ensure that “people are begging for the decision.” Norway’s climate and environment minister said the government must involve the fishing industry in order to better control illegal discarding of fishing gear and waste at sea. Canada’s environment minister said that once the public learned about microbeads in everyday products, they agreed that it was a problem.

Suez, a leading waste and water management company, said 93% of plastic products use virgin materials, and encouraged increasing the amount of recycled plastic. France also called for businesses to include recycled plastics in their products, and said France will build on Canada’s work on plastics pollution as the Group of 7 (G7) president. In June 2018, the Ocean Plastics Charter was endorsed at the Canada-hosted G7 Summit by the EU, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

Canada noted that even with Canada being “good at recycling,” the rate is only 11%, so the chemicals industry has a role to play in finding “leapfrog solutions.” The UK noted the launch in partnership with Canada of a PPP, the Global Plastics Action Partnership. She called on companies such as Suez to make it easier to recycle plastic waste.

Sweden said it is spending US$10 million per year until 2020 to cover municipalities’ costs for cleanup, promote innovation to combat microplastic pollution, and reduce discarded fishing gear. Sweden also established a government inquiry on possible measures to “go beyond EU legislation” on marine pollution. She highlighted the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Ad Hoc Open Ended Expert Group to identify options for combating marine litter for consideration by UNEA-4, noting the need for stronger global and regional architecture on the issue. The Union for the Mediterranean said it is working to identify marine litter hotspots in the Mediterranean region.

Turning to the local level, the mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, highlighted the health consequences of uncollected waste. She said Freetown’s approach will include: getting collection systems working, which needs investment; starting a recycling system and encouraging more businesses to join the sector; innovation and competition for clearing waste and fighting plastic; and joining the move to ban single-use plastic.

The Office of UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said the UNGA President will launch a global campaign and call to action to address plastic waste “once and for all.” She observed that the UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

The Department for International Development (DfID) officially kicked off the Voluntary National Review of the SDGs earlier this week and invited interested parties to contribute directly to the review process.

""People in the UK are doing a lot. We know this,"" the department said on the new website for the Review. ""We would like you to tell us more about it. We are keen to hear about projects at the local level that are helping to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. In the Voluntary National Review, we would like to showcase several examples of the great work being done across the country by different groups.""

As such, businesses and other parties are invited to either fill out a survey on how they are contributing to the SDGs or provide emailed submissions.

The review presents an opportunity for the growing number of companies that have integrated the SDGs into their wider sustainability strategies to showcase their work. According to a recent survey of over 150 sustainability executives from the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) network 71 per cent are either using the SDGs to set internal targets or intend to do so in the near future.

The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 targets, and unlike previous international development goals they are global in their reach, requiring industrialised and developing nations alike to embrace clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and low carbon infrastructure.

As such many of the targets are directly relevant to the UK, and the government is set to detail how its industrial, clean growth, and environment strategies all contribute to the SDGs. Businesses also have a critical role to play in delivering on SDGs that cover everything from clean energy and buildings to industry and transport.

A DFID spokesperson urged businesses to come forward with submissions for the national review.

""The UK is making good progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, with the private sector, NGOs and government all working together to achieve them, but there is still more to be done,"" they said in an emailed statement. ""That is why it is so important that UK businesses use the Voluntary National Review to show how they are using innovation and expertise to help build on the momentum we need to reach the Goals.""

However, the government is also under pressure to provide a more detailed SDG strategy after a report earlier this summer from the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) argued the country was only performing well against a quarter of the SDG targets deemed relevant to the UK.

The report said there were policy gaps or inadequate performance across 57 per cent of the 143 UK-relevant targets, while 15 per cent had 'little to no policy in place' to address them.

Last year the Environmental Audit Committee of MPs similarly accused the government of having 'no strategy or vision' for meeting the SDGs, while a PwC report earlier this year accused multiple governments of paying 'lip service' to the goals.","Businesses, communities, and NGOs across the UK are being urged to submit information on how they are supporting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the UK's first review of progress against the international targets.

The UN agency estimates that, based on current trends, 90 countries are unlikely to achieve SDG target 6.2 on sanitation for all by 2030.

The publication offers guidance for national and local authorities on establishing safe sanitation systems, including principles for toilet design and the storage, transport, treatment and disposal of fecal sludge and wastewater, and principles for interventions to promote behavior change.

The guidelines outline four main recommendations: ensuring that communities have access to toilets that safely contain excreta; assessing health risks to protect people from exposure to excreta, such as through leaky storage; integrating sanitation into local government planning and service provision; and encouraging the health sector to invest more and coordinate sanitation planning to protect public health.

Every dollar invested in sanitation will bring a six-fold return in lower health costs, increased productivity and fewer premature deaths.

SDG target 6.2 seeks to “achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.” WHO estimates that every dollar that countries invest in sanitation will bring a six-fold return in lower health costs, increased productivity and fewer premature deaths.

WHO commended some countries on their actions on sanitation, including India for its launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission, or Clean India Programme, to coordinate action for sanitation access, and Senegal for its work with the private sector to ensure pit latrines and septic tanks are emptied and treated.

The World Bank estimates that infrastructure investments of US$114 billion a year will be needed to make universal access to sanitation a reality.

193,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-finds-poor-outlook-for-pacific-coral-reefs/,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Report Finds Poor Outlook for Pacific Coral Reefs,"27 September 2018: The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) launched a report titled, ‘Status and Trends of Coral Reefs for the Pacific,’ which highlights the role of the region’s coral reefs in the life and culture of eight million Pacific islanders. The report will contribute to reporting for the SDGs and is a response to the priorities identified in the SAMOA Pathway and Pacific Oceanscape Framework.

The report is the culmination of a two-year process initiated at the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) Pacific Workshop, which took place in 2016. The preparation of regional periodic coral reef assessments is the main substantive activity of the GCRMN. UNEP and SPREP developed the report in partnership with the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) and the Centre for Island Research and Environmental Observatory (CRIOBE), with financial support from the Governments of France, Sweden and the US. The report is also expected to inform the mid-term review of the SAMOA Pathway and development of the Pacific Coral Reef Action Plan 2020-2030, which SPREP coordinates.

The report analyzes long-term trends in coral reef health using primary data, including 20,000 surveys collected for 129 islands that cover nearly three decades. Although overall coral cover in the Pacific is relatively stable in comparison with other world regions, the report finds a statistically significant decline in coral cover across the Pacific reefs. In addition, coral reefs in the Pacific remain “less stressed” compared to reefs elsewhere, with strong potential for coral, fish and invertebrate populations to recover following damaging events. However, the report concludes that while many Pacific reefs appear healthy and resilient now, “the outlook is poor” over the longer term as a result of increasing human-induced threats and global climate change.

Key drivers impacting the region’s coral reefs range from overfishing and sedimentation from poor land use to unsustainable tourism.

According to the report, herbivorous fish have declined, particularly in inhabited islands, which has contributed to a shift towards more dominant coral species and a highly variable microalga cover because of the role of these fish in maintaining balance in coral ecosystems and controlling algae growth.

The main drivers of change in coral cover at large scales are coral bleaching driven by climate change, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns seastars and natural stresses from cyclones and storms. At more local scales, key drivers impacting the region’s coral reefs include overfishing and destructive fishing, sedimentation from poor land use, pollution from farming and domestic waste, coral and sand mining, coastal and inland development and unsustainable tourism. Additional threats include improper waste management and introduction of invasive species.

Traditional management practices, such as temporary or permanent closure of fisheries areas or bans on some species, remain “particularly strong in the Pacific” and play a key role in coral reef conservation. The report notes that many countries and territories have sound legislation to manage coral reefs but lack the capacity, logistic resources and occasionally the political will for enforcement.

Recommendations focus on strengthening and adapting local-scale management actions to support healthy reef communities and associated ecosystems, including for human livelihoods. The report recommends, inter alia: reducing overfishing and habitat degradation to maximize coral reef resilience; developing more marine protected areas (MPAs) and strengthening their enforcement and linkages with other MPAs; supporting community-based management efforts; improving catchment management to control damaging coastal development and reduce downstream pollution; and addressing unsustainable resource use and excess population growth. On climate change, the report calls for urgently combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and developing national adaptation strategies.

The report includes the following countries and territories: American Samoa; the Northern Mariana Islands; Cook Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM); Fiji; French Polynesia; Guam; Hawaii; Kiribati; the Marshall Islands; New Caledonia; North Western Hawaiian Islands; Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument; Palau; Papua New Guinea (PNG); Pitcairn Islands; New Caledonia; Samoa; Tonga; Vanuatu; and Wallis and Futuna. Five Pacific island States were not included in the report due to data limitations.

The report titled, ‘Energizing Finance: Understanding the Landscape 2018,’ highlights areas related to financing energy access that require urgent action to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). It notes that committed finance stands at only half of the US$52 billion required annually to achieve universal electricity access. The report warns that funding for clean cooking has declined, accounting for less than one percent of projected funding needed to stop the millions of deaths caused annually by traditional biomass cooking.

The report aims to help finance institutions and policymakers develop and implement strategies that can be scaled and refined to increase affordability and accessibility of clean and sustainable energy. It provides evidence that finance sources considered the most efficient for unlocking greater capital, such as concessional development finance, are decreasing rather than increasing. For example, concessional development finance for electrification decreased by 7 percent to US$4.8 billion.

Concessional development finance for electrification is decreasing.

According to the publication, for the second year in a row, finance committed across the 20 countries accounting for nearly 80 percent of those living without energy access went down. At the same time, finance for coal-powered energy has been on the rise, with annual commitments up from US$2.8 billion to US$6.8 billion.

Speaking about the report, Rachel Kyte, SEforALL CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, underscored the need for a strong project pipeline and sufficient levels of public investment to “crowd in private finance.”

Other key findings from the report include: off-grid solutions remain off-track; solar financing is increasing; two thirds of all electricity finance tracked was concentrated in South Asia, mainly in India; and investment favors non-residential customers.

The report calls for urgent action and recommends that:

international public financial institutions fulfill their commitments to close financing gaps for electricity access;

policymakers prioritize non-coal fired or fossil fuel power generation as part of their integrated energy planning and investment processes;

governments adopt integrated approaches to energy sector policy, planning and regulation; and

leaders, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, use a combination of policy, financial instruments and business model innovation to achieve “last mile access.”

Research for the report was undertaken in partnership with the Climate Policy Initiative. The EU provided financial assistance.

Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

Noting that air pollution affects children “in uniquely damaging ways,” the report finds that 93% of children under 15 around the world breathe toxic air daily.

The report titled, ‘Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air,’ distinguishes between ambient air pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) and their sources, noting that the two have contributed to respiratory tract infections which ultimately killed approximately 543,000 children under 5 years old in 2016. The paper underscores that more than one in every four deaths of children under 5 is related to environmental risks. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus drove the issue home in a press release issued for the report’s launch. “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives,” he stated. “This is inexcusable.”

According to the report, children are at particular risk due to their rapid breathing compared to adults, smaller size, the fact that they live and breathe closer to the ground where pollutants may concentrate, and proximity to polluting fuels used for cooking and heating. They can be exposed to air pollution in utero, through inhalation or through ingestion.

Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives.

WHO stresses that although air pollution is a global issue, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) which contributes to health impacts and deaths is a burden most acutely felt by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – especially those in regions that use polluting fuels for cooking, heating and lighting. Whereas 98% of children under 5 in LMICs are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality guidelines, the figure for high-income countries (HICs) stands at 52%.

The report highlights the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an opportunity to recognize the interlinkages between air pollution and cities (SDG 11), energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13) and health (SDG 3). Towards achieving SDG 7, it cites prior WHO guidance for indoor air quality on household fuel combustion, which discourage the use of kerosene and unprocessed coal due to their health hazards in favor of cleaner biomass and other sources of energy.

Additional findings cover air pollution’s effects on cognitive abilities; negative impacts on mental, motor and lung development; and note that pregnant women who are exposed to air pollution are at increased risk of giving birth prematurely, to underweight children. Recommendations to health professionals emphasize the importance of being informed on air pollution as a risk factor; recognizing exposure; “prescribing” solutions such as switching to clean cooking fuels; and playing an advocacy role when sharing knowledge with policymakers.

The report was released prior to the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health, held from 30 October to 1 November 2018 at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

200,https://www.businessgreen.com/analysis/3065712/how-sdg-business-strategies-are-already-generating-usd233bn-in-revenue,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",www.businessgreen.com,How SDG business strategies are already generating $233bn in revenue,"The business case for driving pursuing globally agreed sustainability goals is often laid out in terms of estimates and projections of future earnings. And on paper, at least, the case is certainly hard to argue with.

According to the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, achieving the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could open up $12tr of market opportunities in food and agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and well-being alone, creating 380 million new jobs by 2030 in the process. Meanwhile, the theory goes, we should all find ourselves living on a far cleaner, greener, fairer, more secure, and more prosperous planet once the goals are met.

ADVERTISEMENT

All that, you would think, goes quite some way towards justifying and incentivising the $5-7tr of investment the UN expects will be needed to meet the SDGs through to 2030.

Yet, projections aside, there have to date been few attempts to actually quantify the impact the SDGs are already having on the global economy, despite the fact 193 countries, 9,000 companies, and investors worth more than $4tr in assets have so far pledged their support for the goals. However, a new tool developed by ESG analyst Trucost looks to do just that.

Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

The startling findings are the result of a new SDG Evaluation Tool developed by Trucost which provides quantitative analysis of company performance against the SDGs across the value chain, from raw material inputs to product use and disposal, within the context of a firm's geographical location.

Trucost, which is part of S&P Global, began working alongside multiple companies, investors, and academics earlier this year to develop the set of metrics, which are aimed at providing market participants with the data transparency needed to accelerate progress on the UN goals.

Among the 13 companies which agreed to take part in the inaugural application of the Tool were renewables firms Iberdrola and Ørsted, as well as a variety of major corporates such as Rockwool, the Walgreens Boots Alliance, HP and, of course, S&P Global. The advisory panel for the research, meanwhile, included the London School of Economics, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Overall it found the 13 companies generated almost $233bn of 'SDG-aligned' business revenues in 2017, equivalent to as much as 87 per cent of their entire revenues that year. If the SDGs represent the world's biggest to do list, then the work is certainly very well paid.

Libby Bernick, managing director and global head of corporate business at Trucost, welcomed the findings. ""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions,"" she added. ""We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

Breaking down the findings, most of the companies' revenues - 79 per cent - derived from products and services which contribute to the SDGs. The results also found companies created ""positive contributions"" across all 17 SDGs, but most significantly in relation to green economy priorities such as Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).

But revenues weren't the only business benefits uncovered by the SDG Tool. Trucost said the analysis shows how working towards the SDGs can help catalyse new ways for companies to think about social and environmental issues - and to guard against risk. After all, the Tool is designed to help companies identify SDG-aligned business value, prioritise risks and opportunities, and inform sustainable growth strategies, not just generate raw revenues.

The companies taking part in the Tool were found to be most active in managing SDG risks associated with responsible consumption and production, including waste and resource efficiency, as set out in SDG 12, as well as issues arising from SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 16 on governance. But while some activity was targeted at addressing supply chain risks, especially with regards to worker conditions, governance, and climate change, the analysis highlighted a need to better manage ESG risks right across the value chain. Moreover, a lack of consistency of action was found across the SDGs, the Tool found, with work on ocean health, hunger and malnutrition largely missing from the 13 companies' sustainability strategies.

As Trucost points out, the analysis shows how such tools and modelling can help screen value chains for SDG risks that companies might otherwise not have been aware of, thereby encouraging better environmental and climate risk disclosure. And given the relative lack of awareness - despite growing take up - of the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), any work to boost understanding of the financial impact of climate change and wider environmental challenges on business is surely welcome.

""The SDGs can encourage companies to consider SDG-related issues that are not commonly monitored and reported in the corporate community, but are still important to the achievement of the SDGs,"" the analysis states.

Given so many firms remain off-track with just 12 years to go to meet the SDGs, there understandably remain significant concerns about the world's ability to deliver on the 17 goals it has set itself by 2030. Far more finance is clearly needed to accelerate action, alongside technological innovation and drastic improvements in the policy environment. But with evidence now emerging that the SDGs are already helping to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue and identify risks at little over a dozen firms, the hope remains that more companies will start to recognise that the huge opportunities that come from embracing sustainable business models are not just a future projection, they are also an existing reality.","Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

The report focuses on Goals 2 (zero hunger), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land).

The report was produced in response to a request from the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), and discussed at the 33rd Session of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts held from 30 October to 2 November 2018, in Tunis, Tunisia.

The report highlights efforts in the four countries to date, noting that Mauritania has included the SDGs in its Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Shared Prosperity (SCAPP) for the period 2016-2030. In Tunisia, a press release notes, a “rapid, integrated evaluation” conducted by the government of its five-year development plan (2016-2020) shows alignment with the SDGs. Overall, however, the publication emphasizes that the process of national ownership and mainstreaming varies by country, and is “still too slow.”

The report identifies Maghreb countries’ needs around:

Accelerating implementation and integration of the SDGs into planning frameworks;

Finalizing mechanisms to coordinate national efforts to implement the SDGs, as well as stakeholder efforts; and

Strengthening the coordination of national and regional statistical systems to improve data availability and coherence, which remains “a considerable challenge for all countries.”

Looking forward, the report recommends that additional efforts be made to align national priorities with the SDGs, increase cross-sectoral partnerships across stakeholder groups, and take the SDGs into account in national budgeting processes. It adds that although regional priorities are reasonably well defined for implementing the 2030 Agenda, few strategic frameworks are available to steer action by Maghreb countries, and target figures at the Maghreb level are lacking. The authors call on the AMU to direct efforts towards: capacity building and knowledge sharing efforts, a Maghreb-wide sustainable development strategy; and implementation of sub-regional programs that support African Union-sponsored initiatives.

At the request of member countries, UNECA’s Office for North Africa will follow up on the report with the production of a regional profile that examines SDG implementation, progress and challenges for the entirety of the sub-region.

The Second Committee’s sustainable development debate began on 15 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) presented seven reports. The first report concerned mainstreaming economic, social, and environmental impacts throughout the UN System. The second report highlighted unfinished business for Agenda 21, indicating that environmental and developmental progress has been mixed and uneven. The third report identified mandates in order to ensure monitoring of SIDS’ and their mainstreaming of the SAMOA Pathway into national development frameworks. These mandates concern resource gaps and research, policy development, and technical analysis. The fourth report addressed remaining challenges with mainstreaming the SAMOA Pathway, enhancing coherence of issues facing SIDS, and matching mandates to resources. The fifth report focused on biodiversity and economic growth in the Caribbean Sea. The sixth report emphasized harmony with nature. The report analyzed implementation trends of law, policy, education, and public engagement. The report also addressed sustainable consumption and production patterns. The seventh report focused on affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) provided updates on responses to address impacts of the El Niño phenomenon. UNISDR said that the clear effects of climate change, which undermine progress made in sustainable and inclusive development, are taking a larger human and economic toll. UNISDR’s report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters,’ found that “20 years have seen a dramatic rise of 151% in direct economic losses from climate change related disasters…1.3 million people lost their lives…4.4 billion people were injured, displaced, or in need of emergency assistance due to disasters.” According to the report, earthquakes and tsunamis accounted for 56% of total deaths due to natural disaster. UNISDR recalled that only two years remain to achieve target (e) of the Sendai Framework, “to substantially increase the number of states with national and local disaster risk reduction targets by 2020.” UNISDR urged States to go beyond establishing targets by gathering data for disaster risk reduction, disaster risk assessments, and the disclosure of disaster risks. UNISDR noted that gaps of the Sendai Framework require attention as States begin their data uploads.

The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) secretariat discussed efforts related to land degradation neutrality (LDN). UNCCD highlighted the creation of the LDN Fund, and noted that more than 120 States have established LDN targets. UNCCD highlighted that LDN efforts offer a way to accelerate progress in addressing forced migration, poverty, conflict from instability and loss of biodiversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) secretariat noted the role of biodiversity in infrastructure provision for human development and life on the planet. CBD announced that 107 of its 196 member States have ratified the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, and 171 of its member States have ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. She also drew attention to the preparations for the 14th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the CBD, and to the need to increase action to achieve biodiversity targets by 2020 as well as to look beyond that deadline.

The UN Environment Programme (UN Environment) discussed its global campaign to beat plastic pollution, and highlighted the need for a focus on sound management of chemicals and waste, marine litter and microplastics, exposure to lead paint, and mainstreaming of biodiversity. He also noted the role for regional strategies and agreements.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) discussed the importance of entrepreneurship for sustainable development by creating jobs and spurring economic growth. UNCTAD stressed the need for long term and cross-sectorial strategies for sustainable development. UNCTAD presented six pillars of entrepreneurship for sustainable development: national entrepreneurship strategies, optimizing the regulatory framework, enhancing skills and education development, improving access to finance, facilitating technology innovation and exchange, promoting awareness and networking.

In the Committee’s debate on sustainable development, delegates touched on finance, disasters, gaps, partnerships, and the importance of a sustainable environment. Maldives speaking on behalf for SIDS, presented struggles they currently face due to lack of access to finance. El Salvador called for public, private, domestic, and international mobilization of finances in the pursuit of 2030 Agenda. Bangladesh announced investments to make its agriculture sector resilient to climate change. Cuba expressed concern about large financial resources allocated to arms or speculation while unsustainable consumption and production practices rise. Qatar reported that it is making significant investments in educational programs. Afghanistan stressed technical and financial assistance specifically in reliable and sustainable energy. Jamaica said that risk-informed investments are key to action in DRR. Ethiopia said financial provisions are imperative for energy infrastructure development in LDCs. Mauritius stated that lack of access to concessional financing prevents resilience in its state. Sierra Leone urged the provision of financial resources to enable environmental energy investment. The Maldives and Nauru said financing can provide the answer for filling gaps in required resource allocation. Syria discussed the challenges it faces in implementing the SDGs, including terrorism and economic sanctions.

Malawi, Maldives, India, Singapore, Qatar, Nepal, the Republic of Moldova, and Armenia highlighted the vital role of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. India discussed its partnership with France and other countries to create an international solar alliance, in which 70 states already participate. The Maldives said partnerships have been instrumental for its lighthouse initiative.

Speaking on disasters, Malawi expressed how easily natural disasters can reduce progress made by LDCs. Armenia highlighted the role of information sharing in climate change disaster risk reduction. Mozambique discussed its master plan for disaster risk reduction that began in 2017 and ends in 2030. Mexico, Egypt, Malawi, Syria, Nepal, Brazil, Namibia, and Sierra Leone discussed environmental sustainability through biodiversity and renewable energy.

Commitments focus on the Conference’s six themes: marine protected areas (MPAs); sustainable fisheries; marine pollution; climate change; sustainable blue economy; and maritime security. The US$10.7 billion in pledges represent commitments from a wide range of actors, with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the corporate sector announcing the majority of the commitments.

The Conference convened from 29-30 October in Bali, Indonesia, and focused on the theme, ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy,’ with participants reflecting on choices and actions to maintain the sustainability of ocean resources and to preserve ocean health, as heritage presented for our children and grandchildren. The 2018 Conference also featured the third ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy Youth Leadership Summit.’

Indonesia announced 23 commitments, amounting to over US$80 million. In addition, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, said the government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target date of 2020. Indonesia’s commitments focus on improving management effectiveness of existing MPAs, designating additional MPAs and protecting sensitive marine ecosystems, among other actions.

The EU made 23 new commitments across the six themes of the Our Ocean Conference, representing approximately 300 million Euros. On the blue economy, the EU announced, inter alia: joint action with China on marine data; a research and innovation agenda for the Black Sea basin; promotion of ‘Blue Labs’ in the EU to research and develop products or services in support of the blue economy; four regional projects under its satellite monitoring programme, bringing together 18 African countries and the African Union (AU) to develop services related to fisheries and aquaculture, coastal vulnerability and risk management, coastal ecosystems monitoring, ship trafficking and development of regional ocean forecast centers in Africa and the Indian Ocean; and support for the sustainable development of Seychelles’ fisheries sector. The EU will also enhance cooperation with South Africa and Brazil towards an All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance that will assess ecosystems, map the seafloor and develop innovative ecosystem-based aquaculture systems with the aim of having over 1,000 research teams working from Antarctica to the Arctic by 2020.

On marine protection, the EU announced, inter alia: projects to protect marine ecosystems and promote exchange of knowledge on effective management of MPAs between the Atlantic and Southeast Asia; a regional support programme for the sustainable management of natural resources in Pacific Overseas Countries and Territories; and a new version of the ‘Digital Observatory for Protected Areas’ (DOPA), an online database and information system on terrestrial, marine and coastal protected areas.

The Indonesian Government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target data of 2020.

On marine pollution, the EU announced, inter alia: a project to reduce plastic waste and marine litter in South East Asia, with the aim of supporting a transition to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) of plastic and reduction of marine litter; the upgrade of its ‘Floating Macro Litter Monitoring Application’ to make information on marine pollution from rivers accessible to the general public; and support for a waste management programme for the Pacific countries to address marine litter, biodiversity conservation and health and well-being. As part of its new plastics strategy, the EU announced it has initiated new rules on packaging to improve plastic recycling and increase demand for recycled plastic; measures to curb plastic waste and littering; and development of harmonized rules for defining and labeling biodegradable and compostable plastics, among other actions.

On climate change, the EU committed to start designing new ocean forecasting models to support the further development of the its satellite monitoring programme. Improved forecasting is expected to help the EU plan ahead and support decision making to tackle climate change impacts and build resilience to climate risks, including coastal erosion, floods and storm surges.

The US made 15 commitments, including two five-year programmes in Madagascar to improve community-based management of marine and coastal resources and support improvements in the enabling environment for community-based biodiversity conservation and sustainable development approaches and the ‘Fish Right Program’ in the Philippines to increase fish stocks by improving fisheries management and building the resilience of fishing communities. In Central America, the US will support biodiversity conservation in targeted coastal marine areas and upland ecosystems in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Additional commitments will provide support to, inter alia: the Tropical Pacific Observing Systems (TPOS) 2020 Project to improve understanding of the ocean’s role in climate and weather and of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ocean Acidification International Coordination Center (OA-ICC); efforts to tackle illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, piracy and human trafficking; efforts to promote sustainable waste management systems to prevent marine debris from entering the ocean; and research initiatives on coastal wetland ecosystems.

On marine pollution, many countries committed to reduce waste and improve waste management to reduce marine plastic pollution in the oceans, including Chile, the EU, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands and Thailand. Norway will assist developing countries to combat marine litter and microplastics through the World Bank’s fund PROBLUE. The World Bank committed over US$1 billion over the next seven years to advance sustainable oceans and the blue economy, including US$250 million to address marine litter and pollution.

Several companies announced plans to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in their materials, in line with a global commitment to eliminate plastic waste, launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). Danone-Aqua committed to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50 percent by 2025 and to ensure all plastic packaging is 100 percent recyclable. Nestle will make its packaging 100 percent recyclable or reusable by 2025. The Coca-Cola Company will contribute to a circular economy by making its packaging 100 percent recyclable by 2025 and including 50 percent recycled content across the company’s primary packaging globally by 2030. Unilever will ensure 100 percent of its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and increase recycled plastic content in its packaging to at least 35 percent by 2025.

Numerous countries and other stakeholders announced MPA commitments, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Panama, Peru, Poland and Sweden. New Caledonia will protect its seamounts by the end of 2019. Papua New Guinea (PNG) announced plans to triple its MPA coverage and to designate national marine sanctuaries in ten percent of its offshore waters by 2025, and to establish MPAs in ten percent of its territorial waters and coastline by 2025. The UK will triple its current targets to ensure that 30 percent of the ocean is designated as an MPA by 2030. The UK will also publish a cross-Government International Ocean Strategy by the end of 2018 that sets out the country’s contribution to achieving SDG 14 (life below water) through global governance and international cooperation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) committed US$50 million to create, expand and improve the effectiveness of over eight million hectares of MPAs as part of its new cycle of funding.

On sustainable fisheries, Chile committed to protect 98 percent of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from bottom trawling. The Netherlands announced additional support for the development and publication of the Seafood Stewardship Index, explaining that this commitment will contribute to SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 14 and 15 (life on land). Norway will support science for better management of ecosystems and fisheries, including through a three-month research cruise in Antarctica. Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Ireland, Japan, Peru and Thailand also announced commitments.

Our Ocean Conference 2018 continued a tradition of tracking past commitments and encouraging new commitments and partnerships to deliver multiple objectives. In addition, the Conference introduced the Our Ocean Commitment Registry, to facilitate tracking and review of past and new commitments.

According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day. But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.

Business has a vital role to play in ramping up action against poverty. From creating the jobs and opportunities that lead to sustainable incomes, to lobbying governments to introduce effective poverty-fighting economic policies, firms can make a real difference towards making poverty history, for good. ""Without the private sector, the global goals will not be realised,"" Lisa Kingo, CEO and executive director of the UN Global Compact, told attendees at the SDG Business Forum in New York earlier this year.

But with such a broad, ambitious goal, it is hard for companies to know where to start. BusinessGreen spoke to some of the world's leading experts on how businesses should practically address SDG1 through their own operations - here are their key recommendations.

1. Do no harm

It may be a guiding principle for medical professionals around the world, but the mantra 'do no harm' is also central to any successful business approach to the SDGs. To make sure that firms looking to tackle SDG1 don't roll back on progress in other areas - for example, by clearing rainforest to bring agricultural jobs to a region, at the expense of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions that could lead to worsening poverty down the line - businesses should start their SDG efforts by applying the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UNGC.

""If all companies subscribed to the 10 principles of the UN global compact we would already go a long way to delivering on the global goals,"" she says.

The 10 principles are effectively a checklist for running a good business. They include support and protection for human rights, effective abolition of child labour, a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, and a promise to work against corruption in any form. Adhering to these principles is the first step to ensuring all subsequent actions on the SDGs act as a positive force for sustainable development, rather than an inadvertent impediment to their aims.

2. Understand the problem - and find out which solutions work

Any number of factors conspire to lock people in poverty, from government corruption and conflict, to poor education and extreme weather. The first step to tackling poverty effectively is working out which of those factors are related to your business operations and how exactly you can address it, says Marika McCauley Sine, vice president for global human rights at Mars.

""Poverty is a manifestation of a lack of respect for rights, lack of the ability to manage environmental challenges and threats like climate change, low income and a range of other drivers,"" she says. ""The first step is understanding the barriers that people face to rising up out of poverty and reflecting on one's ability to impact those barriers.""

Mars started this process in its own operations in 2016, by taking a long look at its supply chain to work out where the pressure points are. Its Farmer Income Lab, which launched last year, then set about identifying proven strategies for alleviating poverty among smallholder farmers. ""That's been our brief and our focus for this first year of the Lab - what does work to enable farmers to increase their income?"" says McCauley Sine. ""It's been fascinating to begin to review the evidence base, to take a look at the landscape of what is actually out there in terms of evidence and begin to see what really does work, what people think works but actually may not, and to begin to identify some of the common factors that most successful programs out there share.""

Solving the poverty problem is often not as simple as bumping up the pay for those at the bottom of the ladder, she warns, and firms may need to prepare themselves for more radical change in how their business operates. ""Perhaps historically the business sector has approached the issue of poverty from a livelihood lens,"" she says. ""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains. I think Mars' view is that it is not enough. What we need to do is reflect deeply on the current realities that people face who are in poverty, who are touched in some way by the reach of our global value chains, and consider what real transformation looks like. And where there is poverty, challenging ourselves to go beyond incremental improvements to deliver real transformation"".

3. Don't plump for the obvious goal

If you're a renewable energy company, your first instinct on looking at the SDGs might be to think 'great, we are contributing to SDG 7 - clean and affordable energy - and that's our role in the SDGs sorted'.

Not so fast, says James Gomme, director of SDGs at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ""You need a robust analysis of all of the goals as your starting point, and not passing over anything in that initial scan,"" he says. ""You need to do that initial analysis and have that conversation internally, and perhaps with peers and stakeholders as well, around what SDGs can you really drive direct impact on through your operations and through your supply chain.""

You should only start to narrow down on the goals you want to focus on once that analysis is complete, he adds.

Companies assuming that SDG1 doesn't apply to them is one of the major reasons why it is ranked as a low-priority goal for the business community. But by doing a first broad sweep of all 17 Goals - and understanding how each one touches your business operations - SDG1 may not be so often neglected by the business community.

And don't be fooled into thinking SDG1 is one for governments rather than business because of the way it's written. WBCSD's Gomme advises firms to look past the ""developmental"" language - because there is a clear role for business in tackling poverty.

""All the text is written for governments, and it's written in UN language, and it's a case of understanding how that interacts with your business, and understanding what you can do on that agenda,"" he stresses. ""And the companies that understand that best and put time into interpreting that agenda for their business will be the companies that are ultimately able to leverage the opportunities that the SDGs represent.""

4. Work backwards

Mike Tuffrey, co-founder of sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship, says many corporates are making the mistake of assessing how their activities are already contributing to an SDG, rather than working out what is needed to help hit SDG1's specific ambitions.

Firms should look more closely at the gap between what is happening on the ground today, and where the SDG or its sub-target say we should be in 2030, he says. ""They are not working back on an individual goal from what's required to say 'what do we need to do?'""

It is worth remembering that although the headline SDGs are broad, the 169 sub-targets offer explicit detail on what's expected. SDG1, for example, has five sub-targets:

By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.

By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

To make a real impact on a goal, firms should understand the sub-targets and work backwards, to get a clear idea of the ambition gap that needs filling, Tuffrey concludes.

5. Harness your lobbying power

Tackling SDG1 doesn't necessarily mean flying in armies of volunteers to run resource-intensive projects on the ground - companies should not disregard their influence to change government and social policy, argues Oxfam's Matthew Spencer.

He points to the example of Myanmar, where in 2015 the government was proposing to create a minimum wage of US$2.60 per day for workers. Garment manufacturers in the country were proposing an opt-out for their industry, but after 30 European companies including Tesco and M&S wrote to the Myanmar government opposing the suggestion on the grounds that it would deter them from investing in the country, the government forced through the new base wage.

""That [letter] helped give the government confidence that they could go through with that sensible social protection, anti-poverty measure, and as a result 30,000 garment workers have benefited,"" Spencer says. ""So that's an example of business working to improve the conditions of the poorest in their supply chain.""

6. And if in doubt, start with the UN's four top actions

The UN Global Compact has helpfully identified for top business actions for SDG1, for firms still struggling to determine how best to play their part.

Karbassi explains: ""In the case of SDG1 we have four actions that we identify as business leading actions. The first one is the creation of secure and decent jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations.

""The second one is the empowerment of disadvantaged groups, particularly in terms of economic empowerment.

""Then we have the engagement of companies around their supply chain, and the ability to provide decent working conditions for employees around the supply chain"".

Finally the fourth action is around developing goods and services ""that would target vulnerable groups"" and grow the green economy. ""There's a whole market around that which is not fully taken advantage of,"" she says - pointing to products such as mobile banking applications, microloans, and home solar systems.","As things currently stand, the world is on track to miss the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which targets the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day.
But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.
""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains.
WBCSD's Gomme advises firms to look past the ""developmental"" language - because there is a clear role for business in tackling poverty."

By moving to embed the aims of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their sustainability strategies, 13 of the world's biggest corporates have collectively generated $233bn of revenue.

That is the key finding of a new report from financial assessment firm Trucost, which analysed the benefits that the 13 companies had reaped from taking SDG-aligned actions across their value chains, from raw material sourcing to product and packaging disposal.

Covering firms such as technology giant HP, health and beauty chain Walgreens Boots Alliance and energy firms Iberdrola and Ørsted, Trucost’s analysis reveals that the 13 companies collectively generated around $233bn of 'SDG-aligned' business revenues in 2017.

Given that the companies collectively record annual revenues of $266bn, this figure accounts for as much as 87% of each firm’s individual revenue.

The analysis was conducted with the help of Trucost’s newly-developed SDG evaluation tool, which aims to assess whether a company has achieved “holistic” alignment with the SDGs, based on its sector and location.

The tool takes into account the extent to which an organisation is exposed to SDG-related risks; the actions it has taken to mitigate negative impacts on society and the environment; the positive contributions it has made to the SDGs and whether its approach is balanced.

Developed with expertise from the likes of the London School of Economics, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the tool was trialled on 34 companies before being released on Monday (5 November).

Aside from generating raw revenue, TruCost’s managing director and global head of corporate business Libby Bernick explained that the tool was designed to help businesses identify SDG-aligned business value, prioritise risks and opportunities and update their sustainable growth strategies.

""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions,"" Bernick said.

""We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

The 13 companies to have been analysed in the report are Walgreens Boots Alliance, Tarkett, Spectrum Brands Holdings, S&P Global, Rockwool Group, Ingersoll Rand, HP, CLP Holdings, Arm, AMD, Aguas Andinas, Iberdrola and Ørsted

SDG stumbling blocks

Since the unveiling of the framework in 2015, 193 countries, 9000 companies and investors with more than $4 trillion in assets have pledged their support to the SDGs.

But as more and more businesses move to align with all or some of the Global Goals, recent research by KPMG found that companies are still struggling to achieve boardroom buy-in for action on the SDGs due to a lack of available metrics for tracking progress against their aims.

In other words, despite recent studies suggesting that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies, case studies proving the specific benefits of adopting each and all of the Goals at a business level is rare.

Similarly, PwC has found that two-fifths of businesses are still failing to engage meaningfully with the SDGs, while the UN Global Compact has concluded that the private sector is failing to follow through on commitments.

These findings, compounded by the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) claims that the nation is only performing well on 24% of targets considered relevant to the domestic delivery of the Goals, spurred the UK Government to launch its first review into business performance against the SDGs earlier this year.

Governments are expected to adopt guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and flesh out the details required to operationalize the treaty through the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP). Paris Agreement implementation contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and advances SDG 13 (climate action). This policy brief outlines expectations for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, and is structured around the three questions of the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there?

The conference, running from 2-14 December 2018, will include the meetings of five bodies: the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC; the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 14); the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1-3); the 49th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI); and the seventh part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-7).

The political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue, a political process seeking to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) initiated in January 2018, will be held during the second week of the COP. Based on information gathered during the Dialogue’s preparatory phase, which is reflected in a synthesis report by the Fijian Presidency of COP 23 and the incoming Polish Presidency of COP 24, the political phase will take stock of Parties’ collective action towards “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels,” in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

Where Are We?

The last round of negotiations in Bangkok, Thailand, concluded with the adoption of identical conclusions under the APA, SBI and SBSTA – the ‘Bangkok Outcome,’ which also includes the ‘PAWP Compilation,’ a 307 page-long document capturing the work of the three bodies. Negotiations in Bangkok were based on a set of seven “tools,” prepared by the APA Co-Chairs. The APA also convened a one-day round table that sought to identify substantive linkages across the various parts of the PAWP, which many saw as constructive. However, progress achieved in Bangkok was “uneven,” and, some noted, likely “insufficient” to set Parties up for a successful conclusion of the PAWP in Katowice.

In preparation for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, APA, SBI and SBSTA Presiding Officers have prepared, under their own responsibility, a joint reflections note addressing progress made at the Bangkok session, and identifying ways forward, “including textual proposals,” to help advance Parties’ deliberations towards the PAWP. Negotiations in Katowice are expected to be informed by this document, which includes nine addenda outlining the ways forward and textual proposals on the various elements of the PAWP. These correspond to the APA agenda items and relate to:

mitigation : developing further guidance on features and transparency of, and accounting for, NDCs; NDC registry; common time frames for NDCs; and modalities, work programme and functions of the forum on the impacts of the implementation of response measures;

: developing further guidance on features and transparency of, and accounting for, NDCs; NDC registry; common time frames for NDCs; and modalities, work programme and functions of the forum on the impacts of the implementation of response measures; adaptation : further guidance on adaptation communication and adaptation communication registry;

: further guidance on adaptation communication and adaptation communication registry; transparency : modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for action and support;

: modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for action and support; the global stocktake (GST);

(GST); compliance : developing the modalities and procedures for the effective operation of the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, established by Article 15 of the Paris Agreement; and

: developing the modalities and procedures for the effective operation of the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, established by Article 15 of the Paris Agreement; and further matters.

Parties have raised numerous issues under “further matters,” including elaborating the governance and institutional arrangements for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement, a new collective finance goal, guidelines for countries when they adjust their NDCs and loss and damage, which, some Parties feel, the CMP ought to “take up.”

Where Do We Want to Go?

Delivering a detailed set of guidelines on the numerous aspects of the PAWP is no doubt a tall order, especially given the fact that, in Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s (ENB) estimation, the Bangkok session “did little to bring the PAWP into sharper focus,” and there is little clarity on how the multiple cogs and gears will fit together. The task is further complicated by the many sticking points, with deep-rooted divergences, which have also given rise to new disagreements.

For example, differences over differentiation appear to persist in spite of the Paris Agreement arguably “settling the matter” by weakening the developed/developing country firewall. The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) continues to be concerned over “the attempt by some to undermine” the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDCs) has lamented developed countries’ “repeated attempts” to renegotiate the Paris Agreement by “erasing differentiation” in negotiations on NDCs in the context of mitigation, as well as on compliance and the transparency framework. The BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) have also expressed their desire to see work on mitigation reflect differentiation between developed and developing countries, with developed countries taking the lead on emission reduction. Many developed countries maintain that this bifurcated approach, particularly to NDCs in the context of mitigation, “has no basis” in the Paris Agreement.

The developed/developing divide has spilled over to negotiations under the enhanced transparency framework. Developed countries view transparency of mitigation efforts as key to reaching the objective of the Paris Agreement, whereas developing countries find transparency of support provided and received of paramount importance. Communication by developed countries of transparent and consistent information under Article 9.7 on accounting modalities for provided finance also remains contentious.

Parties will need to advance work on the PAWP in spite of these and other differences in a speedy and coordinated fashion in order to complete the guidelines in Katowice. The incoming COP Presidency’s push for political declarations on a just transition, forests and electric mobility may present an additional challenge, given that the task of operationalizing the Paris Agreement is momentous, and time and resources are limited.

How Do We Get There?

The recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) has warned that while limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels is still possible, it will require rapid and “unprecedented” transitions in all aspects of society, including: the transformation of energy, agricultural, urban and industrial systems; engagement of non-State actors; and integration of climate action into broader public policy and development frameworks. The urgency of global, concerted climate action has been highlighted by other reports, including NewClimate Institute’s ‘Global Climate Action from Cities, Regions and Businesses,’ the UNFCCC ‘Yearbook for Global Climate Action 2018’ and the WWF ‘Living Planet Report 2018,’ which paints a “sobering picture” of the impact of human activity on the world’s wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers and climate.

Several States have recently announced ambitious carbon neutrality targets, expanding the membership of the Carbon Neutrality Coalition that includes countries and cities alike. In a recent report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognized the importance of government decisions in bending renewable energy trends and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Non-State actors, including federal states, regions, investors, businesses and civil society, showcased a broad range of climate initiatives at the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in September 2018. If implemented, these pledges, together with countries’ NDCs, will bring the world closer to the 2°C target. It remains to be seen if the operational guidelines Parties are expected to agree in Katowice will catalyze climate action ambitious enough to keep the warming under 1.5°C – the temperature threshold that will offer some of the most vulnerable countries “the best chance for survival.”

Thus, it is no surprise that clean water and sanitation are prioritized in the UN SDGs. Committed to safeguarding a sustainable future, the SDGs aim to address global challenges by 2030. Linked to social and economic development, wastewater management is a vital component in achieving SDG 6, most notably in developing countries (Target 6A).

Annually, the lives of 361,000 children under the age of 5 are lost due to diarrhea; public health is threatened by poor sanitation and contaminated water. Untreated wastewater increases the risk of the transmission of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid. In our pursuit of vitality and sustainability, the provision of functioning sanitation systems not only offsets these consequences, it could also act as a channel to convert our waste into resources – a procedure otherwise known as resource recovery.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that three quarters of those practicing open defecation are concentrated in five countries: India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Pakistan. While municipal treatment plants are an established, effective solution to waste management, they are costly and often complex, and demand large amounts of energy and trained personnel (Avellán and Gremillion 2018). The prerequisites to support such an infrastructure can be a burden for developing countries. Adaptable, pragmatic solutions that are cheaper exist, and should be used.

Hiding in Plain Sight

A study by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) explores how constructed wetlands address these challenges through the Nexus Approach. Constructed wetlands are a prime example of a low-tech, cost-effective solution whose value has yet to be fully realized. As the collecting point for wastewater, this biologically diverse ecosystem unlocks its potential by recycling the waste component into resources. Additionally, the low-cost and low-tech features of constructed wetlands make them highly adaptable to various contexts such as rural and peri-urban areas in both developed and developing countries.

World Toilet Day is observed on 19 November, and the UN is committed to implementing sanitation solutions that are embedded in our environment. This year’s theme, centering on Nature-based Solutions (NbS), promotes actions that protect, manage, and restore ecosystems while simultaneously addressing societal challenges. Mending the environmental costs of open defecation and providing ecosystem services such as aesthetic value and biodiversity, wetlands are a leading example of NbS. By installing toilets and subsequent locally suitable sanitation systems, wastewater is treated and can then be repurposed for irrigation, with the remaining nutrients being used as fertilizer (see infographic). With the capacity to provide effluent for irrigation and create biomass, constructed wetlands can, in addition to the ability to offset irrigation needs, provide a sustainable bioenergy source.

Securing energy needs through using renewables made of land crops does not go without compromise. Water resources are used to nurture these crops, and instead of being used for food, they are used as a substitute for unsustainable fuel sources. This puts both energy and food security at risk. However, the return of energy supplied by wetland biomass has the capacity to provide a part of the energy needed in small communities or neighborhoods. Furthermore, if mixed with household and livestock organic waste, wetland biomass can generate biogas. The result is a rise in the yield of biofuel used for household cooking – an attractive alternative to energy conversion.

It Takes a Village

With the ability to supply energy to communities both large and small, it is necessary to filter wastewater through constructed wetlands. Calling upon community efforts to achieve sustainable water management is hence an ideal approach, particularly in developing countries (Target 6B). Favorably, toilets mitigate the impact of open defecation and support wastewater treatment. Combined, these effects can lead to the increased availability of water, nutrient, and energy resources.

Looking forward, an emphasis on educating people on good sanitation and the collective effort of communities are necessary to implement these measures. The low-tech, cost-effective features of constructed wetlands and their potential for revenue generation are great incentives. We must, hence, continuously advocate to advance constructed wetlands as a sustainable solution that secures food and energy production without compromising our limited resources.

Just over a quarter (28%) of businesses have set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help them measure and disclose their positive contributions towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite repeated warnings that corporate action has been slow and weak.

That is a key conclusion of a new report from professional services giant PwC, which has revealed the results of a survey of 700 corporates on SDG action.

Published today (26 November), the firm’s SDG reporting challenge report shows that almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses have mentioned the Global Goals in their annual corporate or sustainability reports this year – a 10% increase since 2017.

Half of the companies, meanwhile, claimed they had identified “priority” SDGs – areas where their firm or sector could maximise their positive impact.

However, the report concludes that concrete measures for SDG action and integration remain “elusive” for the majority of businesses, with an inability to identify ambitious or long-term goals cited as a key barrier.

Specifically, it notes that only 27% of corporate survey respondents mention the SDGs as part of their business or sustainability strategy in annual reports, and that just 19% of chief executive or chair statements in annual reports mention the 17 Goals.

“The increase in companies indicating the SDGs challenge in their reporting is a positive sign of engagement that will increasingly need to be backed by strategies which look beyond business as usual at the opportunities being presented,” PwC’s global sustainability reporting and assurance lead Alan McGill said.

“Success with the SDGs depends on making them a central part of business strategy. What is planned for, measured and reported in public filing is a good indicator of what is embedded in a businesses’ strategy and priorities.”

Ambition or action?

The findings of the new report echo those made by PwC at the start of the year, when the firm surveyed 500 companies across 17 countries on similar issues.

In that survey, PwC found that most respondents were failing to explicitly make the connection between the 17 Goals and 169 targets, placing SDG logos into their reports as “lip service” rather than working to convert stakeholder aspiration into corporate action.

Similarly, sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship has warned that tangible plans and partnerships on the global goals have stalled, while the UN Global Compact has concluded that the private sector is failing to follow through on commitments.

The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) claims that Britain is only performing well on 24% of targets considered relevant to the domestic delivery of the Goals. This finding has spurred the UK Government to launch its first review into business performance against the SDGs earlier this year.

“While there is a clear appetite for embracing the SDGs, many organisations still lack the strategy, tools and culture needed to transform those commitments into tangible business actions,” PwC’s global SDGs lead Louise Scott added.

“For every one of the 17 Goals, there are pressing real-world issues that directly impact the world of business.”

In partnership with consultancy firm Ditto Sustainability, edie recently published an SDG “blueprint” providing clear, practical steps that can be taken to embed the Global Goals in business strategies. You can download that document by clicking here.

Sarah George","PwC: Business still failing to turn SDG ambition into actionJust over a quarter (28%) of businesses have set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help them measure and disclose their positive contributions towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite repeated warnings that corporate action has been slow and weak.
That is a key conclusion of a new report from professional services giant PwC, which has revealed the results of a survey of 700 corporates on SDG action.
Published today (26 November), the firm’s SDG reporting challenge report shows that almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses have mentioned the Global Goals in their annual corporate or sustainability reports this year – a 10% increase since 2017.
“Success with the SDGs depends on making them a central part of business strategy.

212,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/wwf-report-reveals-devastating-human-impact-on-planetary-health/,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WWF Report Reveals “Devastating” Human Impact on Planetary Health,"30 October 2018: Human activity is pushing the planet’s natural systems that support life on Earth to the brink, according to a report published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which presents a “sobering picture” of the impact of human activity on the world’s wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers and climate.

The ‘Living Planet Report 2018: Aiming Higher’ presents a comprehensive overview of the state of the natural world, through multiple indicators, including the Living Planet Index (LPI), which examines trends in global wildlife by tracking 16,704 populations of 4,005 vertebrate species, and shows that global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians declined by 60% between 1970 and 2014.

The report analyzed data from six measurement tools, all of which show a decline, with extinction risks for five taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads). The report outlines changes in species distribution, extinction risk and changes in community composition, which all show declines or changes. The findings reveal that humans have already pushed four of six of the Earth’s processes beyond a safe limit, namely: climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows and land-system change.

The report suggests 2030 as an end date for the biodiversity-related SDG targets, given the difficulty of abruptly halting current trends.

The report, which contends that biodiversity and the overall health of the planet are declining but that global commitment can still reverse the trend, provides a roadmap for action on nature for 2020 and beyond, which calls for the convergence of the environment and human development agendas to build a sustainable future. It highlights opportunities leading up to 2020, when progress made on the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be reviewed.

The report discusses SDGs specifically directed at the natural world, namely SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land), including SDG target 15.5 on reducing natural habitat degradation, halting biodiversity loss, and protecting and preventing threatened species extinction. While noting that some biodiversity-related SDG targets have 2020 as an end date, the report suggests 2030 as an end date for the biodiversity-related SDG targets, given the difficulty of abruptly halting current trends.

The report argues that measuring progress towards biodiversity targets is more complicated than tracking progress under the Paris Agreement on emission reductions, given that biodiversity assessment requires multiple measures at different spatial scales and across different ecological dimensions.

Other report findings include:

overexploitation and agriculture, both linked to increasing human consumption, are the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss;

the Earth has lost an estimated half of its shallow water corals in the past 30 years and 20% of the Amazon in 50 years;

nature provides about US$125 trillion worth of services per year;

species population declines are especially pronounced in the tropics, with South and Central America suffering an 89% loss compared to 1970; and

the Freshwater Index shows an 83% decline since 1970.

We are one-fifth of our way towards 2030, but miles behind on achieving the lofty goals to reduce poverty, increase prosperity, protect the planet and advance peace.

There are worrying signs that the number of extremely poor people in the world – which has long been dropping – may stop falling and might even start rising. And after years of decline, hunger is increasing – with observers linking this to regional conflicts and climate change. Of most concern: the world’s development agenda, based around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is not fit for purpose.

The development agenda is flawed because it is the inevitable result of trying to be all things to all people. The highly successful Millennium Development Goals which preceded SDGs were short and sharp – and made a huge difference to global progress – yet were criticised for having been non-inclusive.

In response, the UN laudably invited a long list of players to create SDGs – but then failed to prioritise the Agenda to make it manageable and implementable.

Thus, vitally important targets – such as the eradication of all forms of malnutrition, and getting more boys and girls into school – are devalued by being placed on an equal footing with targets as peripheral and vague as promoting “sustainable tourism”, ensuring that people are informed about how to have “lifestyles in harmony with nature”, and creating more green spaces for “women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities”.

Faced with the impossibly long list, in three years only two countries – India and Germany – have made even a partial assessment of how much investment is required for the goals. The Agenda is woefully underfunded – one estimate shows $2.5 trillion more needed each year. Even if we spent all of the world’s development funding it would only get us 5% of the way. We really have to prioritise what we want first.

This was clear even when SDGs were being created. My thinktank, Copenhagen Consensus Center, analysed SDG targets in real time as they were drafted, and enlisted a panel of Nobel laureate economists to identify the most and least effective. Their findings make it clear what needs to be done. If we want to get out in front of increasing hunger, then we need to tackle the problem effectively.

Climate and peacekeeping policies are expensive and complex, and at best do very little to solve problems like hunger, even in relatively long time frames. Yet, cheap investments can be made in fixing micronutrient deficiencies in children, helping immensely and right now.

Investing an extra $8 billion annually in agricultural R&D would increase yields globally, generating more food at lower cost. It could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent 5 million cases of child malnourishment, with each dollar producing $35 of social benefits.

This has the added effect of helping the world’s poorest: the World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors.

Poverty has a simple solution: As in China, free trade can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Although Trump makes it harder, we have been dithering for much longer. We must revive the WTO’s Doha Round, which would lift 145 million people out of poverty by 2030. It could make the average person in the developing world $1,000 better off every year – allowing them to not only better feed themselves and their children, but also afford better health care, more education and lead more prosperous lives.

Improved agricultural yields and freer trade are two of 19 concrete, specific development targets that the Nobels identified to do the most, for every dollar invested, to help the world’s poorest, protect the environment, and improve billions of lives. Others include achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs. Focussing on these top 19 targets would achieve about four times more benefits than just thinly spreading funds among all 169 targets.

Because the UN didn’t prioritise when it created the SDGs, nations are making those choices themselves. The biggest risk is that their selection will not be based on which targets could do the most good, but on far more capricious measures such as which targets have more media-friendly images or the most NGO attention. There are some worrying signs.

A preliminary analysis by the OECD shows that rich nations are closest to reaching targets related to ‘Planet and Partnership’ – in other words, issues like climate, biodiversity and oceans. These are issues that fill a lot of column inches in newspapers, and are focussed on by the chattering classes. But global polls consistently show that people care much more about the areas where these countries are lagging behind: the economy, jobs and education, and peace. Three years into the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda, it is clear that we are trying to do too much – and failing to do enough that matters.

Branca F Childhood stunting: a global perspective. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era witnessed an unprecedented drop in mortality among children younger than 5 years and in undernutrition across all regions. However, the poorest children remain 1·9 times more likely than others to die before reaching the age of 5 years.If these child mortality trends persist, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) child mortality targets (reducing neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 livebirths and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 livebirths in all countries by 2030) will not be met in 47 countries, 34 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, undernutrition is prevalent in some regions, with an estimated 151 million children affected by stunting worldwide.This situation is further complicated by burgeoning overnutrition together with vitamin and mineral deficiency in early childhood and their links to adult non-communicable diseases. Reversing current trajectories requires not only applying lessons learned from the MDG era but also addressing all the determinants of child health and wellbeing that will impact whether today's children achieve their maximum potential in every situation. Indeed, evidence shows that about 50% of the reduction in child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 1990 and 2010 was due to indirect influences beyond the health sector.The focus on the health of children must expand beyond mortality to include healthy growth, development, and wellbeing.

et al. Early childhood development coming of age: science through the life course. 7 WHO

Inheriting a sustainable world: atlas on children's health and the environment. A multisectoral approach that addresses all the determinants (social, economic, cultural, political, environmental, and commercial) of child health and wellbeing resonates with the SDGs' promotion of an integrated approach to global social and economic development.There is increasing recognition, for example, of the importance of early life determinants (stimulation, socialisation, and a stable, clean environment) on child social and economic potential over the life course. The 2016 Lancet early child development Series reported that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in LMICs are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential,with widespread consequent impacts. Further, WHO estimates that 27% of all child deaths now arise from environmental causesand almost 90% of the world's children do not breathe clean air. Clean water and sanitation remain beyond the reach of billions of people, and conflict and insecurity affect the domestic stability of and access to health care, good nutrition, and early child education for many children globally. Coordinated action across multiple sectors is required for all children to be able to develop their maximum potential in every country and community. All nations aspire to see their children develop and flourish as a human right and as the basis for a strong economy. In this context, there is a need for guidance and agreement on maximising child health and wellbeing in the SDG era.

On bathwater, babies, and designing programs for impact: evaluations of the Integrated Community Case Management Strategy in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Malawi. In response to this need, and after reviews of several global child health approaches and policies,WHO and UNICEF have initiated a Lancet Commission on Child Health and Wellbeing, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Commission's findings will be published as a report in The Lancet, expected in 2019. The Commissioners are drawn from every geographical region and from disciplines including maternal and child health, nursing, nutrition, epidemiology, human rights, education, environmental and political science, economics, anthropology, and social science.

The Commissioners met in Dakar, Senegal, in February, 2018, to reflect on the state of the world's children and agreed on a process of elaborating a cross-sectoral agenda on child wellbeing that reflects realities in the SDG era. Consensus emerged around the need to address influences during the first two decades of life, with “child” denoting those aged 0–18 years. Five working groups have been established with experts from many disciplines and global regions to collectively address the following areas.

A group on leadership and governance will address how to secure commitment and accountability at all levels of government, as well as among donors, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations, and corporations. A second group will use a systems lens for multisectoral action, and examine how to bring together diverse systems across different sectors to maximise the health and wellbeing outcomes for children in the first 18 years of life, and how to increase accountability for enabling child health and wellbeing across all platforms and levels. A group on financing and economics will consider challenges around microeconomic modelling for financing and focus on identifying the new partnerships, investment policies, and priorities that will increase the chances of more children thriving by 2030. Equity focused data and information for action and accountability that build capacities for accountability and agency will be addressed by a fourth group. Finally, a fifth group will explore family, household, and community approaches to health and wellbeing, and will identify priorities for governments and districts in different settings and how to support the most marginalised communities to build resilience and tackle the drivers of their disadvantage.

This Commission will take a whole of government approach, addressing health and development beyond mortality, and will encapsulate children's perspectives and visions. Of course, context is key. The problems facing Nigeria, Nicaragua, and the Netherlands are different. But there are commonalities. The Commission will focus on the “how to” as opposed to the “what”, the process rather than content. This approach will go beyond a focus on national and ministry decision making. Districts and communities are where multisectoral approaches work best. And community engagement is critical to success; we intend to capture the views, hopes, and dreams of children and young people. At the same time, country ownership and political leadership are necessary. Our Commission will be mindful to align with country level planning processes that address realities on the ground. The methods and findings of the Commission will be inclusive, participatory, and incorporate the perspectives of adolescents and other constituencies, as appropriate.

The Commission's report will not only examine the successes and lessons learned from previous efforts but will also strive to balance optimism with acknowledged harsh realities. Solutions for child health and wellbeing will be viewed through the lens of protection, promotion, prevention, and treatment. We want to build the case for a coordinated response from government, business, and civil society that acknowledges the interdependent nature of the challenge to sustainably improve children's lives in different settings. And we shall suggest monitoring indicators that nations can use to assess progress between now and 2030.

Investment in our children is the first step towards cultivating a healthy, productive society, and should be central to any government's policy and in line with the statutes of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We are confident that the experience and passion of our Commissioners for this topic can benefit generations of children to come.

The action plan is in line with IMO’s commitment to support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water).

The ‘IMO Action Plan to Address Marine Plastic Litter from Ships’ recognizes the wide range of land- and sea-based activities through which marine plastic litter enters the marine environment. The plan highlights the negative effects of large plastic items, small plastic particles and microplastics on biodiversity, marine life and human health. In addition, the plan states that marine plastic litter can negatively impact activities like fishing, shipping and tourism.

The plan recommends specific measures to: reduce marine plastic litter generated from, and retrieved by, fishing vessels; reduce shipping’s contribution to marine plastic litter; improve the effectiveness of port reception and facilities and treatment in reducing marine plastic litter; enhance public awareness, education and seafarer training; improve understanding of the contribution of ships to marine plastic litter; improve understanding of the regulatory framework associated with marine plastic litter from ships; strengthen international cooperation; and target technical cooperation and capacity building.

The action plan recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and UNEP.

The action plan identifies a number of specific measures to tackle marine litter and waste, such as promoting reporting the loss of fishing gear and facilitating the delivery of retrieved fishing gear to shore facilities. Other measures suggest: consideration of actions, such as making marking of fishing gear mandatory, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the establishment of a compulsory mechanism to declare loss of containers at sea and identify the number of losses; and reviewing provisions related to the training of fishing vessel personnel and seafarers to ensure awareness of the impact of marine litter.

In addition, the plan proposes: measures to increase awareness and understanding, including a proposed study on marine plastic litter from ships; looking into the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities; and enhancing public awareness on marine plastic litter. The action plan also recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), such as by making information available to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

The action plan will build on and complement existing mechanisms and legislation that address the discharge of waste and plastic in the sea. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) aims to prevent pollution from ships by prohibiting ships from discharging plastic into the sea and requiring governments to ensure adequate port reception facilities to receive ship waste. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention and Protocol) regulates what materials can be dumped at sea and what materials are not permitted. The Action Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The MEPC adopted the action plan at its 73rd session that convened in London, UK, from 22-26 October 2018.

The UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda aims to enhance the UN’s contribution to sustainable development, ensure more effective capacities to tackle conflict and sustain peace, and improve the UN’s internal management and ability to deliver. As noted in the SDG Knowledge Hub’s Annotated Guide to the UN Secretary-General’s Reform Proposals, the three reform tracks address the fragmentation and bureaucratization of the UN system, which cause gaps, duplication of work, and resource drainage.

On development reform, the ‘United to Reform’ website notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require bold changes to the UN development system for the emergence of a new generation of country teams, centered on a strategic UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and led by an impartial, independent and empowered resident coordinator (RC). The website includes information on the RC’s role, and on the transition team that has been created to provide strategic leadership and oversight to all aspects of the repositioning of the UN development system. The site also features frequently asked questions (FAQs), as well as a backgrounder and key messages on UN development system repositioning.

On management, the website says the reform process seeks to empower managers and staff in the UN and its Secretariat, simplify processes, increase transparency and accountability, and improve on the delivery of UN mandates. It explains that the reorganization of the existing UN Department of Field Support and the UN Department of Management into two new departments (the UN Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the UN Department of Operational Support) seeks to ensure that UN management structures better support all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.

The ‘Management reform’ section of the website also outlines priority areas for improvement, including: improving the speed and responsiveness of service delivery; establishing greater coherence in management structures; strengthening performance management culture; ensuring effective management of resources for mandate implementation; enhancing transparency and accountability; and increasing trust between UN Member States and the UN Secretariat.

Per the website, the peace and security reform process comprises five elements: 1) creating a UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a UN Department of Peace Operations; 2) creating a single political-operational structure with regional responsibilities under the UN Assistant Secretaries-General; 3) establishing a Standing Principals’ Group of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Under-Secretaries-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations; 4) enhancing certain priority areas to ensure coherence and coordination across the peace and security pillar; and 5) introducing several non-structural changes “in the way the peace and security pillar works.”

The website also notes that the peace and security reform aims at, inter alia, prioritizing prevention and sustaining peace, enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of peacekeeping operations and special political missions, and ensuring a closer alignment between peace and security, UN development and human rights pillars.

The initiative will strengthen wildlife law enforcement at ports, and increase cooperation between ports and maritime stakeholders.

According to UNDP, illegal wildlife trafficking from Africa “has surged over the last ten years.” The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) reports that 403 tons of ivory were seized between 2007 and 2017, an amount equivalent to 54,460 killed elephants. The overwhelming majority of ivory is trafficked via the sea, where there is less risk of interception and arrest. Between 2007 and 2017, only one-third of wildlife seizures were made at exit ports in Africa and only 19 percent of all seizures have resulted in convictions. These statistics underscore the importance of targeting transit points and strengthening law enforcement to end incentives for wildlife poaching and stop the illegal trade in wildlife.

The initiative will build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The GEF-financed, World Bank-led Global Wildlife Program (GWP) will target two key African exit ports: Mombasa, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Traffickers regularly use these ports for illegal transportation of poached African wildlife to Asia, including elephant ivory, rhino horns and pangolins. The initiative will strengthen cooperation between key ports in Africa and Asia to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking. In partnership with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), the Royal Foundation, the Global Wildlife Program and others, it will raise awareness among port stakeholders on wildlife crime, and build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The initiative will also contribute to reaching SDG 15 (life on land) and target 15.7 in particular, which calls for taking urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and addressing both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products.

The US$2 million initiative will run for 36 months. The GEF launched the seven-year Global Wildlife Program in 2015. The Program brings together funding from a wide range of partners and works in a number of participating countries to counter wildlife poaching and trafficking.

The compendium is a result of a UNGA high-level meeting on financing the SDGs, organized by then-President Miroslav Lajcak in June 2018.



The event titled, ‘Financing for SDGs – Breaking the Bottlenecks of Investment, from Policy to Impact,’ brought together representatives of UN Member States, the private sector, UN entities, and other international organizations to explore how the UN can better align itself with the world of international finance in support of the 2030 Agenda. Participants took stock of recommendations, initiatives, and best practices for investing in SDG sectors in developing countries. The information shared at the event was then collected in the toolbox, which includes both existing and future global public and private initiatives.

In his letter announcing the toolbox’s launch to UN Member States in September 2018, Lajcak notes that it addresses both increasing private investment in SDG-related sectors, as well as improving the sustainability and inclusivity of private investments. The toolbox identifies four keys to boost financing for the SDGs:

Provide leadership, by setting guiding principles, galvanizing action, and ensuring policy coherence; Mobilize investment, by raising finance and reorienting financial markets towards investment in SDG sectors; Channel investment, by promoting and facilitating investment into SDG sectors; and Maximize investment impact, by increasing the sustainable development benefits and minimizing the risks of investment in SDG sectors.

The toolbox’s website was launched during the World Investment Forum held from 22-26 October 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. It will be managed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and continuously updated.

The Declaration of Astana will feed into discussions at the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 2019 high-level meeting on universal health care.



The Global Conference on Primary Health Care took place from 25-26 October 2018, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Kazakhstan. A high-level session on the first day adopted the Declaration of Astana and discussed a whole-of-government approach to improving primary health care. Yelzhan Birtanov, Minister of Health, Kazakhstan, anticipated that the adoption of the Declaration of Astana will set “new directions” for developing primary health care as the basis of health care systems.

The Declaration commits to strengthening national health care systems and making health for all a reality, 40 years after the first commitment to primary health care was made in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. SDG target 3.8 calls for achieving UHC, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

UNICEF calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single-disease interventions.

UNICEF notes that progress since 1978 has been uneven, with at least half the world’s population lacking access to essential health services, and almost six million children dying from preventable causes before reaching the age of five. The agency calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single disease interventions.

The Declaration acknowledges that, despite “remarkable progress” over the past 40 years, many people around the world still have unmet health care needs. It calls for action to counter the growing costs of health care, medicines and vaccines, and avoid waste and inefficiency in health care spending, acknowledging the impact of disproportionate out-of-pocket spending by patients and their families in causing poverty.

Other issues highlighted in the Declaration include the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, the burden of lifestyle-related and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the impact of environmental factors, such as extreme climate events, that affect people’s health. The Declaration commits to applying both scientific and traditional knowledge in primary health care, providing decent work and appropriate compensation for health professionals, and investing in education and training of the primary health care workforce.

221,https://www.businessgreen.com/feature/3067177/sdg-1-case-study-the-inside-story-of-the-world-banks-first-ida-bond,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",www.businessgreen.com,SDG 1: The inside story of the World Bank's first IDA bond,"The International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, has almost 60 years of experience in providing finance to some of the world's poorest countries. From funding female entrepreneurs in Ethiopia to providing more than two million households in Bangladesh with rooftop solar, the IDA is at the coalface of sustainable development around the world.

But after decades of funding its development work solely through its donors, its 173 member countries, 2016 marked a turning point.

ADVERTISEMENT

Every three years member governments gather at IDA to agree the replenishment rates and consider the institution's priorities for the coming years. The first meeting of IDA18, held just a few months after the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed at the UN, and just weeks after the Paris Agreement on climate change was struck, presented IDA stakeholders with a ""paradigm shift"" in the role of international development. Suddenly climate risk, poverty reduction, and sustainable development were in the global spotlight like never before.

Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is expected to cost between $5tr and $7tr. But in 2016 total official development assistance peaked at just $142.6bn. Looking at the scale of the challenge ahead back in early 2016, IDA made a momentous decision: to seek extra cash from the capital markets for the first time. ""Recognising that more than public money can achieve needs to be done and financed in order to achieve the ambitious SDGs, there was a discussion around bringing in this additional group of stakeholders, the private investors, so that the IDA can do more,"" recalls Heike Reichelt, head of investor relations and new product development at the World Bank.

It was a bold step, but IDA was confident its offer would attract considerable interest, Reichelt tells BusinessGreen. ""One of the reasons why the SDGs have been so warmly embraced by pretty much everyone is because there is this realisation that it's not just governments, it's not just government agencies,"" she explains. ""The private sector has a huge role to play, and the private sector wants to play a role. So it was a very opportune time to look again at IDA's financing model and think about how it can tap private capital.""

Tackling SDG 1 in particular - the target for eradicating poverty - is a key focus for IDA and was a major motivator behind its decision to launch an issuance. ""The SDGs are great and I really like them… but no poverty is in all of them,"" points out Reichelt. ""No hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation - they all move towards no poverty."" She explains IDA's twin goals since its inception are to eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world: ""So if you look at SDG1 - no poverty - that's basically everything we do.""

So with the decision made to reach out to the capital markets to boost IDA's ability to help the world's poorest, Reichelt and her team set off on a 'roadshow' around the world's financial capitals to gauge market interest. The ground had already been prepared by the rise of green and climate bonds, with private investors becoming rapidly more comfortable with impact investing as a mainstream 'liquid' investment opportunity, the term for an investment that can be readily traded and converted into cash.

Reichelt explains: ""There are investors who are focused on impact, focused on the purpose of their investments, and until green bonds impact investing [the market] was all very small, not liquid, type projects. But through green bonds investors have realised that they can have impact by purchasing liquid products.""

This has attracted more risk-averse investors into the market, says Reichelt. ""If you think about impact investing, often times it was investors investing in a particular project in a particular country,"" she explains. ""So those investors are taking the risk that [one project] won't succeed and they won't get repaid... But in the case of bonds, you issue bonds in the capital markets and it's a liquid, tradeable product, a bit like stocks, you can buy and sell them.""

This fitted more neatly with the kind of investors the World Bank traditionally engages with, she says. ""It is investors that are looking for high quality, so in the Triple A rating [category], which is the best credit rating you can get,"" she explains. ""Those are investors that look for safety - so central banks, but also pension funds, asset managers and others.""

Meanwhile, interest in ESG investments is on the rise as the risks of inaction on issues like climate risk become ever starker, and governments around the world push green finance as a growth industry. Investors aren't immune to the reputational bump a well-timed investment in sustainable development can offer either.

So with more larger, cautious players entering the impact investing market, IDA was in a prime position to tout its role as a safe investment bet for doing good. Its 60-year history of loans helped it secure a Triple A rating from the ratings agencies, and its bumper $160bn capital reserve also helped to reassure investors the financials of the issuance were sound.

""[IDA] had a super strong credit, had a good financial product, and then its purpose, its mission, was good,"" recalls Reichelt. ""So it was a very compelling story when we went to see investors.""

""Compelling"" translates into an inaugural bond issue that raised $1.5bn for IDA's lending programme and was heavily over-subscribed. ""We had initially intended to only do $1bn but it was so hard to cut the allocations because it was 4.5 times oversubscribed,"" reveals Reichelt. ""So it was a really tough session, we were talking to investors and some of them really wanted the bonds, so we really had to either cut entirely or give a lot less in bonds to them than they expected.""

Unsuprisingly then, IDA is already planning another bond issuance before its financial year ends in June, eyeing a further capital raise of $1.5bn through a mix of benchmark bonds and private placements. From there Reichelt predicts it will grow steadily, to around $10bn within a decade.

The success of IDA's inaugural issuance represents not just a step change in its strategy, but speaks volumes about the latent demand from the private markets to invest in ways which promote sustainable development. The growing international pressure to eliminate poverty and build a greener, more prosperous society, together with the increasing acceptance of impact investment as a mainstream liquid investment opportunity, have cultivated fertile ground for ethical investments.

Delivering the SDGs will involve billions - perhaps trillions - of investment dollars. But when presented with the right opportunity, it seems private investors are ready and willing to help the world get there.","The International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, has almost 60 years of experience in providing finance to some of the world's poorest countries.

The study, published in Nature, suggests that these findings may mean that emitted greenhouse (GHG) gases have generated far more heat than scientists originally predicted, meaning that the Earth is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than scientists thought.

The study titled, ‘Quantification of Ocean Heath Uptake from Changes in Atmospheric Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Composition’, assesses ocean warmth using “a whole-ocean thermometer” to measure carbon dioxide and atmospheric oxygen, both of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases. In other words, the researchers measured the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen lost by the oceans, and then calculated the amount of warming needed to explain that change in gases. Previous studies have estimated ocean temperature using hydrographic temperature measurements and data, which the authors argue is an “imperfect ocean dataset.”

The findings suggest that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is even harder than previously thought.

The study estimates that the world’s oceans absorbed 60 percent more heat energy between 1991 and 2016 than previous estimates have suggested. Further, the study suggests, GHG emissions generate more heat than scientists originally predicted, which, the authors argue, may make it harder for the world to limit the global average temperature increases to the targets set in the Paris Agreement on climate change. In addition, the findings indicate that extra heat will go into the world’s oceans, resulting in implications for marine ecosystems.

Laure Resplandy, the Princeton University researcher who led the study, said the study finds that the planet warmed more than researchers had previously thought. “It was just hidden from us because we didn’t sample it right,” she explained. Resplandy elaborated that the study suggests that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is “even harder because we close the window for those lower pathways” outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15).

The report notes the importance of economic structural transformation for poverty eradication and long-term development in LDCs.

Titled ‘Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation: Beyond Business as Usual,’ the report defines structural transformation as the transfer of production factors, such as land, labor and capital, from activities and sectors with low productivity and value added to those with higher productivity and value added, which are different “in location and organization, as well as technologically.” The publication discusses: sustainable development, structural transformation and entrepreneurship; the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs; the local entrepreneurship dimension of global production systems; major constraints and current policy frameworks to entrepreneurship in LDCs; and policies for transformational entrepreneurship.

On the LDC entrepreneurial “landscape” the report finds, among other observations, that: self-employment in LDCs is at 70% of total employment compared with 50% across other developing countries, and is declining only slowly; innovation is limited, with an average of 15% of early entrepreneurs reporting the introduction of a new product or service, compared with 24% in other developing countries; and only 12% of early entrepreneurs have a post-secondary education compared with 36% in other developing countries, which shows a low level of educational attainment.

The report states that several structural features of LDC economies, including limited financial development, insufficient infrastructure, lack of institutional development, elevated risk levels and the disempowerment of women, tend to weaken entrepreneurship and enterprise development. It adds that limited urbanization and the disproportionate role of agriculture also have an impact on the nature of enterprises in LDCs.

In order to harness entrepreneurship for structural transformation, the report calls for: entrepreneurship policies to foster linkages between firms of different sizes, stages of maturity and sectors by means of business clusters, networking and alliances; introducing entrepreneurship education and skills development in both mainstream and specialized education programmes; and creating clusters of learning, innovation and creativity involving universities, schools, research, vocational institutes and experimental laboratories to “sustain a flow of new ideas” into firms throughout their life cycle.

LDCs are countries characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The LDC category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures were needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries.

The 47 current LDCs are Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia. Vanuatu and Angola are scheduled to graduate from the LDC category in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.
The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.
The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.
Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services.
“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated."

226,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/africa-report-finds-slow-progress-on-clean-water-energy-urbanization/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Africa Report Finds Slow Progress on Clean Water, Energy, Urbanization","4 December 2018: The 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report highlights the region’s progress on the SDGs and shares lessons learned in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africa’s Agenda 2063. The 2018 report focuses on five Goals, aligned with the focus of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); and SDG 15 (life on land).

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa jointly prepared the annual report. They launched the report at the 12th session of the Committee of Director-Generals of the National Statistics Office, which took place in Khartoum, Sudan.

On SDG 6, the report finds that access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation has improved in Africa but remains very low by global standards, despite the fact that Africa, excluding North Africa, receives the largest amount of official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. In addition, there are wide disparities between and within countries, with higher access in North Africa compared to the rest of the continent. The proportion of people with safely managed sources of drinking water varies from 100% in Mauritius to 19% in Eritrea. Further, 43% of Africa’s rural population has access to basic drinking water services compared to 82% of the urban population. The report identifies several emerging challenges that threaten progress on SDG 6, including climate change, droughts, floods and water management.

On SDG 7, the report finds access to electricity has increased from 39.7% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2014 in Africa. Despite this progress, access to electricity is “much lower than the global average” and rural-urban disparities are “particularly stark,” with an average electrification rate of 70% among the urban population compared to 17% in rural areas. Hydropower generation accounts for slightly over 60% of Africa’s electricity supply but other renewable energy sources, particularly solar, remain “largely untapped.” Africa’s efficiency in energy use has improved but biomass reliance remains a challenge, with approximately 780 million people cooking with solid biomass.

On SDG 11, the report states that Africa is the fastest urbanizing region in the world, with the urban population predicted to increase from 40% today to 51.5% by 2040. The report reflects that much of the continent’s urbanization is “unplanned…and poorly managed,” and is characterized by severe service and infrastructure deficits and social and spatial segregation as well as the world’s highest proportion of slum dwellers. In addition, the report finds that Africa’s cities have made limited progress on air pollution and solid waste collection, loss and damage from disasters, access to public transport and urban sprawl, constraining the region’s efforts to achieve inclusive growth.

On SDG 12, the report finds that Africa, excluding North Africa, wastes more than 30% of its annual food production as a result of poor post-harvest handling, with most losses occurring at the level of production. Africa’s domestic material consumption remains low.

On SDG 15, Africa’s rate of forest cover loss is “much higher” than the global average. In contrast to this regional trend, Ghana and the Gambia have increased their forest cover as a percentage of their land area. Like other regions of the world, the report observes Africa faces the risk of extinction of major animal species. On a positive note, Africa outperforms most world regions in the conservation and sustainable use of its mountain resources.

The report also reflects on SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), emphasizing that the development of science, technology and innovation (STI) are key for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The report finds that Africa’s STI infrastructure, as measured by internet access and access to electricity, “is improving but relatively weak” and characterized by low investments in research and development and fragmented innovation systems. The report recognizes the investments made by Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia on research and development and strategies to strengthen their innovation systems. The report also underscores the need for strengthening inter-sectoral planning and collaboration to ensure coherent, effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

The report recommends that policymakers, inter alia: prioritize investments in water and sanitation to improve access, enhance health outcomes and leverage populations’ productive capacities; improve rural access to energy to address rural-urban disparities; improve access to energy-efficient cooking stoves to enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution and improve health outcomes; and provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The report also calls for strengthening capacities for urban planning and management to drive inclusive and sustainable economic prosperity and integrating urbanization in national development planning.

Participants discussed the report’s findings at the 13th African Economic Conference (AEC), hosted by the UNECA, AfDB and UNDP in Kigali, Rwanda, from 3-5 December 2018. Adam Elhiraika, UNECA, called for investing in data and analysis on urban trends and impacts of environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, among other recommendations. Chidozie Emenuga, AfDB, said the potential of Africa’s rapidly growing cities and urban settlements “has not been fully tapped.” He urged providing incentives to investments in sanitation, renewable energy and access to electricity.

227,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

228,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-promotes-technological-developments-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Promotes Technological Developments for SDGs,"7 December 2018: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution asking key UN bodies for updated findings on the impact of key technological changes vis-a-vis the 2030 Agenda, for discussion at the fourth annual UN Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum). The UN also recently announced that over half the world is using the internet, held a high-level briefing on frontier technologies for sustainable development, and convened a forum on internet governance.

In June 2018, the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), presented initial findings on ways in which technology can support the SDGs, during the third STI Forum. The UNGA resolution adopted on 22 November 2018 (A/RES/73/17) requests the two bodies to update their findings, invites them to strengthen their synergies and mutually reinforce their work on STI, and requests the Secretariat to avoid overlapping meeting dates to further increase coherence. The fourth STI Forum will take place from 14-15 May 2019. Looking ahead to the UNGA’s 74th session, the resolution also invites the UNGA President to convene a high-level thematic debate to take stock of progress on the topic.

Presenting the draft resolution, Juan José Gómez Camacho, Mexico, said new technologies “can change the destinies of nations.” He called for the consideration of technological change in the next follow-up and review cycle on SDG implementation, given the opportunities presented by new technologies, as well as the fact that their impacts will depend on governments’ ability “to come together and cooperate on realizing a global vision.”

On 7 December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) announced that more than half of the world’s population will be using the internet at 2018’s end. ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao noted that the milestone “represents an important step towards a more inclusive global information society.” Despite ITU highlighting that 96% of global society now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, Zhao underscored that many are still waiting to experience the gains associated with internet access or a digital economy. With near-global coverage and the fastest rates of growth taking place in Africa, the impact of the internet on society is only expected to increase.

AI algorithms must shed human biases, participants stressed at the 2018 Internet Governance Forum.

In November, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brought together more than 3,000 participants at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on the theme ‘Internet of Trust.’ Key messages are available on the Forum’s eight major topics:

Cybersecurity, Trust & Privacy;

Development, Innovation & Economic Issues;

Digital Inclusion & Accessibility;

Emerging Technologies;

Evolution of Internet Governance;

Human Rights, Gender & Youth;

Media & Content; and

Technical & Operational Topics.

The Chair’s Summary underscores the cross-cutting nature of new technologies, noting that governance of the internet must be both multistakeholder and multidisciplinary to ensure that systems do not discriminate and that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms shed human biases. [UN Press Release] [IGF Homepage]

The IGF is convened annually by the UN Secretary-General, and this year, was hosted by the Government of France. In his remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron launched the ‘Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described opportunities afforded by the digital world, but also advised vigilance. Recognizing that traditional forms of regulation do not necessarily apply to the new challenges that have accompanied the digital era, Guterres noted the emergence of potential issues around cybersecurity, data and instances of “the Internet being used as a platform for hate speech, for repression, censorship, and control.” Guterres emphasized the need to create a shared language, calling for a dedicated effort to include and amplify weak or missing voices.

Next year’s IGF will be hosted by the Government of Germany. An advisory group containing 52 members has been appointed to lead preparations. [UN News Release]

Also in November, the World Web Summit 2018 took place in Lisbon, Portugal, bringing together approximately 70,000 attendees. The 24 discussion tracks ranged from autonomous vehicles to cryptocurrencies to health. Guterres described the web as having the potential to turbocharge the world’s progress towards the SDGs, saying the UN itself is utilizing technologies to enhance impacts and achieve its goals. He also raised concerns on uneven social impacts, the spread of hate speech as noted at the IGF, and the weaponization of artificial intelligence.

An event titled ‘High-level Briefing on Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development: Findings from the World Economic and Social Survey 2018’ took place on 1 November 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Moderated by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, the event reviewed findings from the 2018 survey, a common message of which is that “technology is neither exogenous nor neutral,” meaning that societal needs and policy prerogatives must guide the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies. The survey and event highlighted national-level policy measures that can maximize technologies’ potential while mitigating risks, taking economic efficiency, equity and ethical considerations into account.

229,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

230,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/escwa-publishes-first-ffd-assessment-for-arab-region/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ESCWA Publishes First FfD Assessment for Arab Region,"November 2018: The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) published its first assessment of the state of financing for development in the Arab region. According to the authors, the ability of Arab societies to withstand, adapt and recover from cascading global and regional crises “is withering.”

The report was published in advance of the International Conference on ‘Financing Sustainable Development – Curbing Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs),’ which took place from 28-29 November 2018, in Beirut, Lebanon. The conference aimed to crystalize the Arab region’s input to the 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development (FfD) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The publication notes that the FfD outlook for the Arab region “remains turbulent,” primarily because of a strained socioeconomic fabric that risks being frayed by the biases of the status quo. The report finds that three years after the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on FfD, the Arab financing gap continues to rise, with trillions needed in quality investments of all kinds. The report stresses that FfD is neither happening at the pace nor magnitude that can turn conflicts, poverty, inequality and other socio-economic hardships into “an issue of the past,” let alone realize sustainable development. The cost of conflict and the region’s post-conflict reconstruction add to the challenge, and divert attention away from the 2030 Agenda.

A finding drawn from the analysis of direct and indirect FfD exposures revealed that between 2011 and 2016, for every US$1 gained/mobilized through prime cross-border FfD channels, the region lost/returned US$2.5 to other regions, including high-income bracket economies. The situation, the report notes, challenges the dominating development narrative, as the region appears to be witnessing “an FfD reflux”: substantial resources are flowing out of rather than into the region, constituting a leakage and opportunity lost to finance the region’s own reconstruction and sustainable development imperatives.

The Arab region is also facing the largest crisis of forced displacement since World War II. The rising death toll, the publication emphasizes, constitutes a more critical concern to reconciliation, given that no price tag can be placed on the loss of life that remains largely unaccounted for in empirical assessments. The authors note that another challenge is the looming “lost generation” of Arab youth: more than 92 million decent jobs need to be created by 2030, at a time when inequalities are set to become more acute within the different segments of Arab societies, with oil-rich Arab economies investing almost US$3 trillion in sovereign wealth funds outside the region, financing this way the public debt of many developed economies.

The report warns that the resources mobilized domestically may fall short of achieving the SDGs if the informal sector remains unintegrated in the formal economy and insulated from the overall planning and implementation of the SDG reform agenda. The prospects of the region to achieve the SDGs are further undermined by the fact that the protracted delivery of the 0.7% target for official development assistance (ODA) is undermining the global FfD framework as large portions of aid budgets (11% of Donor Assistance Committee [DAC] allocations) are diverted to cover in-donor refugee costs.

231,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/aewa-adopts-strategic-plan-and-species-action-plans/,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,AEWA Adopts Strategic Plan and Species Action Plans,"8 December 2018: The seventh session of the Meeting of the Parties (MOP 7) to the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) adopted the Strategic Plan and the Plan of Action for Africa for 2019-2027. The MOP also agreed on key species action plans on African-Eurasian waterbirds, and adopted a resolution on AEWA’s contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Agreement’s relevance to the SDGs.

MOP 7 took place under the theme, ‘Beyond 2020: Shaping Flyway Conservation for the Future.’ The meeting convened from 4-8 December in Durban, South Africa.

On the Aichi Targets and the SDGs, the MOP determines that the greatest benefits to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 are AEWA implementation actions that, inter alia: ensure the conservation and wise use of national networks of protected areas; ensure that land uses are fully compatible with sustaining migratory waterbird populations; reduce, mitigate and compensate for habitat loss and degradation as appropriate, restore degraded habitats to reverse past losses and create new multifunctional wetlands; implement climate change adaptation measures related to waterbird habitats; remove unnecessary causes of waterbird mortality and ensure that harvests, where made, are sustainable; and develop strong engagement with local communities on the management and wise use of waterbirds and their wetland habitats. The MOP urges Parties to ensure that national authorities responsible for AEWA implementation are fully involved in updating national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) to further promote synergies between biodiversity-related treaties; and urges Parties to highlight to their development agencies the relevance of AEWA implementation in the context of SDG delivery and to stress the need to better integrate actions for waterbird and wetland conservation within relevant development projects to achieve benefits for both waterbirds and human communities. The MOP requests the Technical Committee to bring an assessment of AEWA’s contributions to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and a reflection on AEWA’s contribution to the post-2020 development agenda to MOP 8.

Climate change is a key driver of species decline.

Delegates adopted resolutions on, inter alia: guidance on the implementation of the AEWA Action Plan; climate-resilient flyways; strengthening the monitoring of migratory waterbirds; and financial and institutional arrangements. The AEWA Plan of Action for Africa for 2019-2027 responds to contemporary waterbirds conservation issues in Africa and across the flyway. MOP 7 also considered a report on the effects of plastic on waterbirds and on the conservation status of species listed under the Agreement.

On key species action plans, MOP 7 adopted new International Single Species Action and Management Plans (ISSAPs and ISSMPs) for the Barnacle Goose and Greylag Goose. The MOP extended the ISSAPs and ISSMPs for Black-tailed Godwit, Eurasian Spoonbill, Ferruginous Duck, Great Snipe, Lesser Flamingo, Maccoa Duck, Madagascar Pond Heron and White-winged Flufftail for an additional ten years. In addition, MOP 7 retired the plans for the Light-bellied Brent Goose and Black-winged Pratincole.

AEWA Executive Secretary, Jacques Trouvilliez, welcomed the MOP’s adoption of a new Strategic Plan and a Plan of Action for Africa. He said this mandate will enable all countries to collaborate to “ensure a future for waterbirds across a flyway that stretches from the very tip of Africa, across the Middle East to the High Arctic.” Trouvilliez also underscored the Agreement’s work to make the flyway more resilient to climate change, noting that climate change is a key driver of species decline.

AEWA is an intergovernmental treaty focused on the conservation of migratory waterbirds that migrate along the African-Eurasian Flyway. The Agreement covers 254 species of birds that are ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle.

The conference, hosted by the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), also considered the 2018 Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Italy’s SDG Cities Index report.

The Conference on local leadership for sustainability (‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: la leadership locale come motore dello sviluppo’) took place on 29 November 2019, at FEEM, SDSN Italy’s host institution, in Milan, Italy.

Italy’s SDG Cities Index report seeks to guide local policymakers in further aligning municipal initiatives with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Presenting the report, Laura Cavalli, FEEM and SDSN Italy, remarked that about 75% of Italy’s population lives in urban areas, and that the Index could serve as an analytical planning tool for cities to encourage reflection on ways to address population growth and achieve the SDGs, according to the summary of the event.

The report titled, ‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: l’SDSN Italia SDGs City Index 2018,’ currently available in Italian, examines SDG implementation in Italy’s municipalities. It features indicators specific to the Italian context, which can be used to monitor and measure SDG progress at the sub-national level. It examines 101 municipalities on 16 of the 17 SDGs, using 39 statistical indicators. The Index excludes SDG 14 (life below water) for comparability reasons.

Per the summary of the conference, the report finds that Italian cities have achieved approximately 53% of the SDG targets. Out of the 101 cities analyzed, none has “reached more than 80 per cent of overall achievement” on the SDGs.

The Italian SDG City Index was initially presented during a two-week festival on sustainable development organized by the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile – ASviS) and other stakeholders, from 25 May to 7 June 2018, which took place across Italy.

The brief underscores the potential contributions of UN-REDD Programme projects on planning for REDD+ to the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The brief aims to help countries engaged in REDD+ planning to consider additional environmental and social benefits, including biodiversity conservation, provision of food, fuel and fiber, support to local livelihoods and soil erosion control, using an integrated land-use planning approach. The brief further seeks to build capacity on the use of spatial analyses to help identify areas where REDD+ could deliver non-carbon benefits.

On the SDGs, the brief describes REDD+ contributions to SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). For SDG 13, the brief highlights contributions to climate change mitigation through supporting countries in the use of spatial analyses to plan for REDD+ actions that reduce emissions and deliver environmental and social benefits. The brief argues that these analyses help countries to: design interventions that strengthen adaptive capacity and resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters (contributing to SDG target 13.1); integrate climate measures into national planning, policies and strategies (contributing to SDG target 13.2); and improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation (in line with SDG target 13.3).

Consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen implementation of REDD+, the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

REDD+ actions contribute to several SDG 15 targets by focusing on the consideration of benefits beyond carbon in REDD+ and helping countries to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem values into national and local planning and poverty reduction strategies, in line with SDG target 15.9. Further, countries can design REDD+ actions to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services (SDG target 15.1) and mountain ecosystems (SDG target 15.4) as well as to promote the sustainable use of forests and halt deforestation (SDG target 15.2) and reduce habitat degradation and tackle biodiversity loss (SDG target 15.5).

On the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the brief highlights the contributions of REDD+ to Strategic Goals A, B, C and D. As an illustration, UN-REDD Programme projects help countries to identify overlap between areas of high risk of deforestation and areas that are home to endangered species, which helps countries to prioritize areas for REDD+ and sustainable forest management interventions (Aichi Targets 5 and 7) that can reduce pressures on biodiversity and forests while contributing to improvements in species conservation status (Aichi Target 12).

The brief highlights the results of the UN-REDD Programme, which supports 64 partner countries around the world. Twenty-two countries have published a National REDD+ Strategy or Action Plan, all of which include achieving non-carbon benefits among their strategies, goals or objectives. The brief underscores how the consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen REDD+ implementation and simultaneously help countries to achieve the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

Leaders focused on the future of work, infrastructure for development, a sustainable food future and a gender mainstreaming strategy across the G20 agenda, among other topics.

In the Declaration, G20 leaders reaffirm their commitment to leading the transformation towards sustainable development and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as the framework to advance this goal and the G20 Action Plan.

On a sustainable food future, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to tackle food security and encourage the voluntary use and sharing of innovative and traditional agricultural practices and technologies. Leaders highlight the importance of collaboration among public and private stakeholders to facilitate adaptation, strengthen risk management, protect biodiversity and provide effective responses to reduce the impacts of extreme weather on agriculture. Leaders further commit to increase efforts to enhance efficiency, sustainability, productivity and value addition and encourage initiatives to reduce food loss and waste.

On education, G20 leaders recognize access to education as a human right and underline the importance of girls’ education. Leaders commit to promoting coordination between employment and equitable, quality education policies.

On gender, G20 leaders recognize gender equality is critical for economic growth and fair and sustainable development, and note progress in reducing the gender gap in labor force participation while affirming that more needs to be done. Leaders commit to continue to promote initiatives to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls and gender-based violence and to promote women’s economic empowerment and improve labor conditions for all, such as through access to quality and affordable care infrastructure and parental leave and reducing the gender pay gap. Leaders further commit to promote women’s access to leaders and decision making and increase their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and high-tech sectors.

A strong economy and healthy planet are mutually reinforcing.

On infrastructure for development, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to attract more private capital to infrastructure investment, and endorse the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class and the G20 Principles for the Infrastructure Project Preparation Phase. Leaders commit to action to address data gaps, improve risk mitigation instruments and achieve greater contractual standardization.

On climate change, G20 leaders recognize that a strong economy and healthy planet “are mutually reinforcing,” and note the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15). Leaders recognize the importance of comprehensive adaptation strategies, and support actions and cooperation in developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable, including small island developing States (SIDS). Having discussed low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission strategies, shared country experiences and considered the work programme on adaptation, leaders look forward to “successful outcomes” of the Katowice Climate Change Conference. Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirm commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The US reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, “utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment.”

Also on energy, G20 leaders encourage energy transitions that combine growth with decreasing GHG emissions, and recognize opportunities for innovation, growth and job creation through increased investment in cleaner and sustainable energy sources. Leaders further recognize the “role of all energy sources and technologies in the energy mix and different possible national paths to achieve cleaner energy systems under the term ‘transitions’.” Leaders further commit to promote universal energy access by eradicating energy poverty.

On the future of work, G20 leaders recognize the importance of policy responses and international cooperation to ensure that benefits from technological transformations are widely shared. They endorse the Menu of Policy Options for the Future of Work, and state their commitment to consider individual country circumstances to harness technology to strengthen growth and productivity, support people during transitions and address distributional challenges, secure sustainable tax systems and ensure evidence-based decision making. Leaders further express commitment to, inter alia: promoting decent work, vocational training and skills development; making social protection systems strong and portable, subject to national law and circumstances; increasing labor force participation of underrepresented and vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities; implementing policies to improve the employment situation of young people, consistent with the G20 Antalya Youth Goal; and taking actions to eradicate child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and modern slavery in the world of work, including through fostering sustainable supply chains.

In the declaration, leaders also address the importance of: mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion; enhancing early childhood development to break the cycle of intergenerational and structural poverty and reduce inequalities; implementing health-related aspects of the SDGs, including reducing the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR), moving towards universal health coverage (UHC) and ending HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; addressing the root causes of displacement and growing humanitarian needs; and preventing and fighting corruption and fostering transparency and integrity in the public and private sectors.

236,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-spotlight-on-green-growth-and-investment-in-africa/,"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Spotlight on Green Growth and Investment in Africa,"As Isaiah Esipisu laments in an article on IPS News, African media was “poorly represented” at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, which closed in the wee hours of Sunday, 16 December. As a contribution to correcting this shortcoming, this issue of SDG Knowledge Weekly focuses on the newsworthy, Africa-related events that took place and knowledge products that were released around the COP.

The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) previewed findings from a joint assessment of Africa’s “Green Growth Readiness” at a COP 24 side event on 10 December 2018. Through case studies from Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia, the assessment covers: the current state of green growth in Africa; readiness to promote green growth in the context of SDG implementation; and roles of development partners (including AfDB and GGGI) in promoting green growth in the context of implementing the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. An IPS News article reports that the study found urgent needs around finance, as well as the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth.

Also on green growth, the Government of Rwanda hosted the inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum, which took place in Kigali, from 26-30 November 2018, under the theme: ‘For a green and climate resilient Africa.’ The agenda highlights the timing of the Forum just prior to COP 24, noting that the discussions will serve as an input to the discussions in Poland. Among the many speeches and presentations available, Anthony Nyong, AfDB, highlights investing in green growth in Africa. Among other topics, he describes AfDB tools and investment opportunities in the agriculture and energy sectors, barriers to adoption of green growth technologies, and lessons learned at country level.

A regional NDC hub for African countries was launched “to engage national, sub-national, non-state actors and private sector representatives on appropriate policies, strategies and actions tailored to suit individual needs of African countries to enable them deliver their climate change commitments.” The Hub, which AfDB established in November 2017, focuses on three main areas: long-term climate action; mobilizing means of implementation; and coordination, advocacy and partnerships.

An AfDB brochure summarizes the Hub’s purposes, goals and intended outcomes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities, barriers to success and financial needs for fully realizing countries’ NDC targets, laying out a roadmap for achievement. In support of these objectives, AfDB and partners held discussions at COP 24 on encouraging cooperation across regional NDC hubs and operationalizing NDCs in Africa. A compilation of AfDB publications released prior to and in the margins of COP 24 is available here.

Many African countries “already live the future” of a two degrees warmer planet.

Despite progress on NDC implementation, a second article by Isaiah Esipisu on IPS News notes that many African countries “already live the future” of a scenario where the planet has warmed by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Responding to questions by Esipisu, Gernot Laganda, World Food Programme (WFP), stresses that climate change is already affecting food security, noting that the number of hungry people is increasing and extreme weather events continually drag people back into poverty. Agriculture-based economies, such as those in Africa, feel the effects of climate change most acutely, he explains, adding that one consequence of climate change is migration, which “is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism.”

Echoing Laganda’s point on migration, Gilbert Houngbo, President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasizes the need to “invest in Africa’s youth before migration to Europe doubles,” as reported by Hannah Summers in The Guardian. Houngbo flags the importance of investment in sustainable farming on the continent, but acknowledges that more is needed: “priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare.” He also describes access to modern technology as being essential for young people and outlines the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment in rural areas. All are key to ensuring food security and profitability of smallholder farms, which can stem migration flows.

The key, as highlighted by Houngbo above, is investment. The Brookings Institution’s Landry Signé and Witney Schneidman reflect on the inaugural Africa Investment Forum, held from 7-9 November 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Forum, they note, was convened with the aim of “unlocking Africa’s investment potential by facilitating onsite transactions.” While the Forum previewed over 230 projects across 15 sectors and announced investment interest in 49 projects worth US$38.7 billion, Signé and Schneidman note that lower business costs through better business regulations and special economic zones are needed, lest the deals face challenges to implementation and long-term sustainability.

The African Economic Conference was held from 3-5 December 2018, in Kigali, Rwanda. Convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the conference took place on the theme ‘regional and continental integration for Africa’s development,’ building on the March 2018 commitment of 44 African countries to a common market for Africa, known as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the earlier launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016. Supporting papers cover information and communications technology (ICT), economic integration’s impacts on the environment, regional integration versus bilateral diplomacy, food security, gender equality and energy, among other topics. Numerous UNECA press releases on these subjects are also available.

During the conference, UNECA launched the 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report, which tracks the continent’s progress towards both the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063. The report aligns with the theme of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)— “transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies”—focusing on the five SDGs reviewed: 6 (clean water and sanitation); 7 (affordable and clean energy); 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 15 (life on land). A detailed write-up on the report’s findings against each Goal is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Finally, the Intra-African Trade Fair 2018 was held 11-17 December 2018, in Cairo, Egypt. Hosted by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the Fair aimed to bring African businesses together to share information and explore opportunities on the continent. The Afreximbank convened the Fair in part due to low rates of trade within Africa, attributed in part to lack of access to trade and market information.

The guidelines highlight the potential contribution of improved housing to achieving SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).



WHO developed the guidelines based on reviews of the scientific literature and specially commissioned studies. The guidelines are intended for policy makers who set housing-related policies and regulations, and for industry professionals such as urban planners, architects and housing developers. The guidelines affirm the need to address the social determinants of health and tackle social and health inequalities. WHO emphasized that, besides health considerations, better housing conditions can also increase quality of life and help mitigate climate change, as well-insulated housing decreases heating and cooling costs, reducing energy consumption and contributing to achievement of SDG 13 (climate action).

The 172-page publication devotes whole chapters to the topics of household crowding, low indoor temperatures, high indoor temperatures, injury hazards, and accessibility. Various indoor hazards are also addressed, such as smoke, noise, asbestos and radon, a radioactive gas that is linked with cancer.

238,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/fashion-industry-launches-charter-for-climate-action-at-cop-24/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Fashion Industry Launches Charter for Climate Action at COP 24,"10 December 2018: At the Katowice Climate Change Conference, the global fashion sector launched an industry charter that aims to address the fashion sector’s climate impact across its entire value chain. The charter recognizes the fashion industry’s role as both a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and as a sector with opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while contributing to sustainable development.

Forty-three fashion leaders representing fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, a major shipping company and others committed to addressing climate change through the ‘Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,’ which complements and supports other fashion industry initiatives aimed at increasing climate action. The Charter aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and presents a vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition, the Charter sets an initial target for the industry to reduce their aggregate GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, including through phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their companies and direct suppliers beginning in 2025.

In the Charter, CEOs and presidents of fashion organizations commit to support the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and increase their collaboration within and beyond the fashion sectors towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The Charter commits signatories to analyze and set a decarbonization pathway for the fashion industry, building on methodologies from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and by developing a work programme and tools necessary to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets. Signatories further commit to, inter alia: quantify, track and publicly report on GHG emissions; prioritize materials with low-climate impact without negatively affecting other sustainability aspects; and pursue energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in fashion value chains. Signatories also commit to: support a global transition to low-carbon transport by giving preference to low-carbon logistics; support the movement towards circular business models; and establish a closer dialogue with consumers to increase awareness about the GHG emissions caused in use and end-of-life phases of products, to build towards changed consumer behaviors that reduce environmental impacts and extend the useful life of products.

The Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work.

The Charter developed out of efforts by fashion leaders to shape a climate movement, which was chaired by PUMA SE and H&M Group. PUMA CEO Bjørn Gulden said shared supply chains generate over 90 percent of PUMA’s carbon footprint. He stressed that if PUMA wants to reduce carbon emissions in its supply chain, the company must “work together with our industry peers.” He welcomed the Charter’s collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, and called on other industry peers to join the initiative. H&M Group CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said the Charter will help unite the fashion industry in climate work, emphasizing that “only together” can the industry “create the change that is urgently needed.” He said H&M supports the Charter as part of the Group’s “ambition to become climate positive in our value chain.”

UNFCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa observed that the fashion industry “is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture” and is now also “leading the way in terms of climate action.” She welcomed the Charter, expressing hope that it will set an example for others to follow.

To ensure concrete progress on the Charter’s commitments, the Charter establishes seven working groups in which signatories will work to define next steps for implementation. The working groups are: decarbonization pathway and GHG emission reductions; raw material; manufacturing/energy; logistics; policy engagement; leveraging existing tools and initiatives; and promoting broader climate action. The UNFCCC is expected to convene the working groups in early 2019, and will play a role in tracking industry progress towards the Charter. The Charter is open for other companies and organizations to join.

239,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

The analysis ranks 91 areas of disclosure in terms of their materiality to companies in 40 sectors, then links those areas to the 169 SDG targets to determine which areas and targets are the most important within each sector.

The publication titled, ‘Sector Study on Sustainability Materiality of the SDG Targets and GRI Indicators,’ aims to provide a starting point for discussion and planning around analyzing and determining the sector-specific materiality of the SDG targets and GRI indicators / disclosure topics. “Materiality” refers to the importance of an issue to a company or industry. As a legal concept, it is a measure or threshold above which missing or incorrect information, particularly in financial statements, is considered to have an impact on decision making.

An all-sector overview report outlines the study’s methodology, various uses, and potential for further company- and sector-specific analysis. The authors review the 1,387 reports published between March 2016 and March 2017 in accordance with GRI’s G4 guidelines. GRI has since adopted a common set of standards, to which the report maps and translates the previous G4 areas of disclosure.

The study is divided into sector-specific publications, such as: aerospace and defense; mining; pharmaceuticals; and travel & leisure. Each sector report lists the companies whose reports were analyzed, then ranks the most important SDG targets and GRI indicators using a standardized scoring system. Each rank notes the corresponding SDG, target, overarching business theme, relevant GRI G4 indicator, and linked GRI Standard Disclosure, and provides a description of the GRI indicator.

The reports also provide color-coded heatmaps to identify the most important areas. The overview report notes which SDGs are most important to which sectors, and which sectors are most commonly reporting on which SDGs.

The HLPF will convene on the afternoon of Tuesday, 24 September and all day on Wednesday, 25 September 2019, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Q&A refers to the meeting as the “SDG Summit,” noting that it will meet under the auspices of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at the level of Heads of State and Heads of Government. The chair will be the president of UNGA 74.

DESA points to three expected outcomes from the Summit: a political declaration, a range of voluntary commitments, and the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the UN’s role. On the political declaration, DESA says that this will be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the Forum, following negotiations by Member States in a process to be co-facilitated by the permanent representatives of Bahamas and Sweden. The declaration will provide political guidance on accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, DESA notes.

On the voluntary commitments, the Q&A says that governments and stakeholders are encouraged to announce commitments for the implementation of SDGs. Commitments can be announced during the Summit, or online before the Summit.

On the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and UN role, DESA suggests that the Summit “could demonstrate the benefits of an inclusive multilateralism through the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the revitalization of the United Nations’ role in linking peace and security, human rights and development and promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda as the international community seeks to provide global solutions to our common challenges, promote prosperity for all and endeavor to leave no one behind.”

The three events will be mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate progress towards sustainable development, DESA notes.

The Summit also is expected to play several other roles, including:

Enable the international community to look back at areas where progress has been insufficient to meet the Goals on time, and identify what can be done to catalyze the needed changes;

Identify and showcase areas of progress, and consider actions needed for scaling up;

Share experiences and best practices, and provide access to tools that can accelerate change; and

Provide a space for building partnerships to further SDG achievement at all levels.

The Summit will convene in parallel to the UNGA’s general debate as it begins its 74th session in September 2019. Taking place back-to-back with the Summit will be the 2019 Climate Summit convened by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and the UNGA’s High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development (FFD). Like the SDG Summit/HPLF meeting under UNGA auspices, the FFD dialogue is mandated by the 2030 Agenda to take place every four years. DESA notes that the three events will be “mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate the progress towards sustainable development.”

Finally, the Summit will include side events, special events and exhibitions on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, civil society meetings, and an SDG media zone.

The policy brief is based on findings from the NDC-SDG Connections Tool, developed by the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and SEI, which analyzes connections between climate change and the SDGs by identifying synergies. The tool derives activities from countries’ NDCs into categories of climate action, and links these with SDG targets.

The complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes.

The authors identify SDG themes with the strongest climate synergies such as energy, agriculture, water, resilience, resource efficiency, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and infrastructure. The document notes that different ministerial departments are responsible for implementing the NDCs and SDGs, and highlights that “too often they work in silos, and the complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes of decision-making.”

The authors note that new approaches at the global, national and sub-national levels that integrate horizontal and vertical decision making and increase policy coherence are essential to avoid implementation inefficiencies and to assist in achieving desired outcomes.

The brief highlights trade-offs and gaps between climate action and sustainable development arising from implementation, which include trade-offs in the global stocktake (GST) process under the Paris Agreement on climate change and financing processes. To minimize trade-offs, the authors recommend that countries that have not yet embarked on implementing the SDGs design their future national sustainable development strategies in a way that takes account of and complements their existing NDCs by focusing on issues that have not been addressed in them. They also recommend that countries take into account existing national sustainable development strategies and their synergistic potential in their future NDCs.

This SDG Knowledge Weekly compiles knowledge products that link topics under discussion at COP 24 to the G20 Summit’s theme, priorities and outcome. Those topics include implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, inclusive growth, the future of work, and support to developing countries.

The G20 Leaders’ Declaration keeps “the multilateralism torch alive” according to In Depth News, and reaffirms their countries’ commitment to “leading the transformation towards sustainable development and support[ing] the 2030 Agenda as the framework for advancing this goal.” The Declaration further: notes that the Paris Agreement on climate change is “irreversible”; commits their countries to its full implementation; and encourages “energy transitions that combine growth with decreasing greenhouse (GHG) gas emissions.”

Although the Leaders’ outcome holds promise, the international community also identified areas to watch in the lead-up to COP 24, noting the prominent role of coal in host country Poland’s economy, and a continued emissions gap. On clear rules for the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP), IISD’s Elena Kosolapova summarizes where we stand going into COP 24 and key issues for discussion in an SDG Knowledge Hub policy brief. Daily IISD Reporting Services coverage of COP 24 is also available here.

The German Development Institute’s (DIE) issue of The Current Column from 26 November 2018 notes that the “Paris Agreement new needs clear rules and higher ambition.” Authors Britta Horstmann and Jacopo Bencini describe discussions under the Talanoa Dialogue in addition to contested issues such as reporting requirements for future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and the extent which requirements can or should differ between developed and developing countries. “If UN climate policy still wants to influence climate reality in a positive way,” they conclude, “it needs to increase speed.”

A special issue of the Carbon & Climate Law Review (CCLR) “on the Paris Rulebook” explores topics currently under negotiation. The outcome will impact areas such as GHG accounting rules, modalities for the Paris Agreement’s review mechanisms (the transparency framework, global stocktake and implementation and compliance mechanism), and rules for the operation of the new cooperative mechanisms established by the Agreement.

An introduction to the CCLR issue by Harro van Asselt, Kati Kulovesi and Michael Mehling outlines elements of the Paris Rulebook; summarizes other others’ contributions in areas of finance, transparency and compliance; and describes the “spectrum of possible outcomes” that can arise at the end of the COP. Other articles describe the interplay between accounting and reporting on mitigation efforts; and areas of learning from the SDG implementation process.

On meeting ambition and delivering on pledges, the Climate South project assesses the performance and scope of cooperative initiatives registered with the UN Climate Change Climate Action Portal. Although the study and report find that the initiatives’ performance is largely positive, there is a “continuing gap between the global North and South in terms of visibility, participation, and leadership.” The report notes that approximately a quarter of the cooperative initiatives come from non-OECD countries, but points to “sizeable” participation in the Latina America and Caribbean (LAC) and African regions. It further notes that the gap may be partially attributable increased visibility of sub-national and non-state actors in developed countries, which in developing country contexts may mean that climate actions “go unrecorded in international platforms and databases.”

Climate South is a three-year project that aims to develop a rigorous social scientific evidence base to support effective climate action by cities, regional governments, and businesses in developing countries. It is led by the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS) (Kenya), the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University (UK), DIE (Germany), and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) (India).

The Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP) hosted its Sixth Annual Conference from 27-29 November 2018, in Paris, France, in conjunction with the OECD’s 2018 Green Growth and Sustainable Development Forum (GGSD) on the theme, ‘Inclusive solutions for the green transition: Competitiveness, jobs/skills and social dimensions.’ Joint GGKP-OECD issue papers on the theme of the conference and forum review transition management strategies, green policies and firms’ competitiveness, opportunities for individuals and households, and how small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can drive green and inclusive growth.

The agenda discussed managing a green jobs and skills transition, green growth and competitiveness, and the social impacts of a green transition. A range of parallel discussions—on which supporting papers authored by the speakers are organized by session under the GGKP Conference Page’s “Program” tab—included topics on, inter alia: “greening” the workforce; policies for regional resilience, climate adaptation and spatial planning systems in Asia; energy pricing and distributional impacts; opportunities and challenges facing SMEs in a green transition; trade vis-a-vis environmental goods and international competitiveness; and the perception of green growth and other climate change policies.

Focusing on the least developed countries (LDCs), the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) released three short briefings:

Higher Ambition for Lower Temperatures: What LDCs could achieve at COP 24, which reviews LDC-relevant findings from the IPCC special report, summarizes LDCs’ expectations for the COP, and advises that LDCs emphasize the importance of helping vulnerable societies strengthen their adaptation capacity, including through finance and technology transfer.

Harnessing Long-term Strategies for Low-carbon Climate-resilient LDC Development, which makes the case for LDCs’ early preparation of such strategies, discusses incentives to do so before 2020, and identifies entry points for effective long-term adaptation planning.

COP 24: LDCs’ moment to shape an inclusive climate transparency framework, which identifies special circumstances and challenges facing LDCs on transparency of mitigation, adaptation and support, also outlining priority areas regarding the operationalization of an enhanced transparency framework (ETF).

It also links to government commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.

Climate actions and solutions, which will help achieve SDG 13 must also contribute to achieving SDG 5 by being gender-responsive.

During the launch of the framework on 28 November 2018, UN Resident Coordinator in Uganda, Rosa Malango, underscored that climate actions and solutions, which will help achieve SDG 13 (climate action), must also contribute to achieving SDG 5 (gender equality) by being gender-responsive and giving rural women relief due to the fact that women are the hardest hit by the negative impacts of climate change. Participants also highlighted that, inter alia, NAP-Ag has set a good foundation and precedent for the preparation of NAPs for other sectors.

Integrating agriculture into NAPs will also help to enhance: institutional capacities and processes for operationalizing climate response strategies in the agriculture sector; access to international climate finance sources; and strategic allocations of national budgets earmarked for adaptation investments. Next steps include disseminating the plan to relevant stakeholders, resource mobilization and implementation of the 21 adaptation options.

The strategic framework was developed with technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), through the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs (NAP-Ag) Programme, which supports partner countries to identify and integrate climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sectors into relevant national planning and budgeting processes.

245,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-votes-to-adopt-global-compact-on-refugees/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Votes to Adopt Global Compact on Refugees,"17 December 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted the Global Compact on Refugees, following a consultation process including a series of thematic discussions and meetings in 2017, and formal consultations on successive drafts between February and July 2018. UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés noted that the adoption of the Compact marks the beginning, not the end, of the international community’s work to respond comprehensively “to the challenges that face refugees and their hosts.”

The Global Compact on Refugees was called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which also called for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The latter was adopted by 164 governments in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10 December 2018, and is scheduled to be formally endorsed on 19 December 2018, in the UNGA Hall in New York, US.

The refugee compact, while not legally binding, seeks to strengthen the international response to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations, and to better define cooperation to share responsibilities. It builds on existing international law and standards, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and human rights treaties. The Compact comprises four parts: i) an introduction setting out the background, guiding principles and objectives of the compact; ii) the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), as agreed to by UN Member States in Annex I of the New York Declaration; iii) a Programme of Action setting out concrete measures to help meet the objectives of the Compact; and iv) arrangements for follow-up and review.

The Compact was presented to the UNGA in September 2018 as part of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ 2018 annual report, and was then discussed during a high-level ministerial event hosted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On 17 December 2018, the UNGA considered the Global Compact on Refugees as part of a resolution on the Office of the UNHCR, which was adopted with 181 votes in favor, two against and three abstentions.

In a media stakeout following the Compact’s adoption, Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, clarified that the US and Hungary had opposed the UNGA resolution containing the Compact. However, he added that in 2018 UNHCR received the highest contribution ever from the US. The three governments abstaining from the vote were Eritrea, Liberia and Libya.

Also on 17 December, following the UNGA meeting to adopt the Compact, UNHCR hosted an event to mark the agreement. Espinosa said that through this agreement, the UNGA demonstrates its efficacy and utility, and cements its role as the ‘Parliament of Humanity.’ She added that low and middle-income countries host over 80% of all refugees.

The refugee compact contains four elements of particular importance for achieving the SDGs, including measures to ease pressures on host countries.

Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General, on behalf of the UN Secretary-General, outlined four elements of the Compact that are particularly important for achieving the SDGs. She noted that the Compact: i) sets out concrete measures to share the responsibility and ease the pressure on the small number of countries that host the majority of refugees; ii) seeks to bring humanitarian and development action closer together, building on the UN Secretary-General’s reform of the UN development system; iii) provides ways to create jobs and livelihoods, and recognizes that refugees and host communities themselves must be at the center of decision-making on refugee issues; and iv) calls on the international community as a whole to take broader initiatives to prevent conflict and build sustained peace.

Grandi noted that it was the first time there was such a concerted effort to reach an agreement on refugees at the UNGA. He reported that 15 countries have rolled out the Compact’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which he said has mobilized US$6.5 billion that would have not been accessible through traditional finances.

On next steps, Grandi highlighted that the Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, to take stock of the Compact’s commitments and achievements. He noted the need to plan for this event.

Via video messages, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Foreign Minister of Turkey, said the international community has not done enough to help refugees, and should also strengthen support to host countries and communities. Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stressed the importance of shared responsibility and partnerships to respond to the refugee crisis, adding that the EU and its member States comprise the largest donor worldwide.

Bertine Bahige, a Congolese refugee resettled in the US, remarked that all refugees are looking for hope, and are victims of circumstances they have not chosen. Talking about his experience spending five years in a refugee camp in Mozambique, he said he had felt safe and was given access to resources, but wished he could have had access to education and given the possibility to start building his life.

246,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/afforestation-increases-water-supply-but-only-with-these-considerations/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Afforestation Increases Water Supply – But Only with These Considerations,"With increasing needs for water and food security and rapid urbanisation resulting from a booming global population, forests maintenance and development face great competition with other priorities. While we are losing forest resources at a high rate globally, afforestation efforts are made in some regions to offset this adverse effect.

Afforestation is the preferred measure for policymakers to solve a range of ecological problems, as it is generally believed that forests help to improve soil health and quality, reverse land degradation, halt land desertification, and provide clean water through an intensified water cycle. Especially within the context of SDG 15 (life on land), does afforestation always have a positive effect? The answer is ‘no,’ at least not always for water provision. A study of the relationship between afforestation and water supply in several regions under different climate conditions shows afforestation resulted in a decline in water supply in all climates (see Table 1).

These outcomes contradict the common belief that afforestation increases water supply. A critical driving process of these results is evapotranspiration, which is a key hydrological process in the water cycle. When lands are converted from other land uses to forests, the partitioning of precipitation into green (part of water available for plant use) and blue (part of water available for human use) water fluxes changes.

Evapotranspiration is a major green water flux, while river discharge and groundwater are typical blue water fluxes. Tree growth can consume more water than other shorter vegetation. According to the mass balance principle, if more water is used by trees, less water will flow into rivers and lakes or recharge the groundwater that people can directly use. The direct impact on water supply is becoming an increasingly urgent issue for water resource managers and planners as demands for water continue to rise.

How then can a positive effect of afforestation on water supply be achieved? We need to consider three central aspects.

First, scale matters: afforestation can accelerate the water cycle and movement at the global level. For example, more than 2 square kilometers of forest expansion can increase the possibility of rainfall. Trees transport water to the air, and water vapour moves to another place which can be geographically far from the afforested location, such as to another country or even continent through wind-driven circulation. This increases the possibility of precipitation in another location and thus contributes to the water supply in that other region. This indicates that, at a global scale, afforestation can indeed bring benefits to the water cycle.

Second, species matters: we must choose suitable tree species for afforestation to have a positive effect on the local water supply. Depending on the species, plantation forests may have different structure and amounts of water consumption (Schwärzel et al. 2018). Tree water use also declines with age. Over time, runoff reduction trends can be reversed, and water supply can be improved. Evidence shows, for example, that water supply may start to improve after 30 years in the case of pines and 15 years in the case of eucalypts (Scott and Prinsloo 2008).

Third, site matters: we need to establish forests in the right place. In dryland, less water is available from precipitation. As tree cover increases, the amount of water available is likely to become less and less, which is critical for areas that already suffer from water shortage and have high demand and competition for water (Zhang and Schwärzel 2017). Compared to dry-prone climates, water is not a limiting factor in tropical climate due to high precipitation. The decline in water supply resulting from afforestation is likely less critical and might even be negligible.

At the global level, many afforestation efforts are ongoing. There are, among others, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) in China, National Afforestation and Reforestation Plan (PNFR) in Ecuador, and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) in India. In Nigeria, afforestation is considered as a promising solution to achieve climate change mitigation and to solve water supply issues (Olorunfemi et al. 2016).

Nigeria recognises the importance of keeping their forests. The Nigerian savannah has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 16°C to 37°C and an annual rainfall about 1,220 milimeters. Afforestation in this region could induce more precipitation, and water availability could potentially increase in the long term. However, we should also recognise that there are risks for water supply in the short term.

Forests – when managed properly – can increase resilience of water supply to enable adaptation to global change. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) recently published a global assessment report highlighting that all of the SDGs are either directly or indirectly related to water and the forest-water nexus. Scientific insights on the forest-water nexus are particularly important to manage and optimize the trade-offs. Afforestation does not always have positive effects on the water supply. The seasonal and annual water yield from forested areas largely depends on forest management, covering selection of tree species, forest structure, and density.

Understanding the interlinkages and feedback loops – as advocated by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) via the Nexus Approach – will support more effective and integrated policymaking, and represents an important contribution towards achieving the SDGs.

The reforms to the RC system are part of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ efforts to align the UN development system with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.



During its 72nd session, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) agreed on a new funding scheme for the RC system, which will require a total investment of $US281 million in 2019. The reform of the RC system entails delinking it from the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and aims to create a system that is fully dedicated to the 2030 Agenda and independent from any UN agency, while being more transparent and more accountable to Member States.

The Fifth Committee met on 28 November 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Chandramouli Ramanathan, Acting Controller, introduced the Secretary‑General’s report on the matter, noting that the UNGA had decided to double the amount contributed to the RC system through the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG’s) cost‑sharing arrangements. This arrangement, which is one of three overall funding sources for the RC system, will amount to US$77.5 million for 2019. The UN Secretariat’s share is $13.57 million.

In the ensuing discussion, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that as the UN reconfigures the RC system, transparency and accountability to governments are essential, given that the UN development system relies “heavily” on the RC system to fulfill the mandates of intergovernmentally agreed outcomes related to sustainable development. Pakistan said poverty eradication should remain UN development system’s overarching goal.

China stressed that the new RC system should not compete with UN’s existing resources. The Philippines said the funding arrangement for the RC system must address the decline of core contributions while putting no additional burdens on programme countries.

Switzerland also for Liechtenstein emphasized that the Secretary‑General must provide full transparency to all stakeholders on the system’s expenditures, total costs of operations and results achieved. She commended the Secretary‑General for proposing relevant mechanisms to that end, including a dedicated website for Member States and partners.

On 14 November, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner updated Member States on preparations to ensure the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019. Among his updates, he noted that the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) has been transitioned to the Secretariat, and outlined the process of transitioning the current RCs to the new arrangements.

By aligning short- and medium-term needs for adaptation and mitigation measures with resources and support from 18 NDC Partnership members through existing and planned projects, the plan seeks to fast track climate action.

The Partnership Plan addresses short-term priority needs set by the government for implementation of its long-term 2020-2025 NDC Roadmap, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring framework on low-carbon and resilient development that details sector-specific priorities that was developed through local and national level consultations. The Plan covers agriculture, civil aviation, energy, early warning systems, forestry, health, transport, urban mobility, waste and water.

The Partnership Plan focuses on:

development of pipelines of bankable climate change-related projects;

resource mobilization and project financing;

strengthening institutional coordination;

strengthening regulatory and institutional environments;

capacity enhancement for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors;

monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems and data management;

budget coding and tracking systems; and

private sector engagement.

Mozambique based its current NDC on its National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy 2013-2030, which seeks to increase community and economic resilience, and promote low-carbon development through integrating adaptation and mitigation into sectoral and local planning. The government has committed to reduce about 76.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 eq) from 2020 to 2030, conditional on the provision of support from the international community.

The Plan was developed in consultation with 21 government ministries and institutions and 18 NDC Partnership members, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Governments of Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the US, the European Commission (EC), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI), among others.

Thing is, they added so much flow to a ride that the piss-poor dependability was sorta accepted back then. Riders would fix or replace them, but who went back to a tall posting? No one, I'd guess. These days, a dropper has to not just go up and down, but also do it for a long time without needing any attention.



SDG's new Tellis post needs to do exactly that in order to be considered a contender, which is exactly why I've had the $269.99 USD dropper on a high-mileage bike for the last six months. The cable-actuated, hydraulically-controlled Tellis can be had with 125mm or 150mm of drop, and there will also be a 170mm version available early in 2019.

Can a dropper post be reasonably priced and still be reliable? SDG's Tellis is exactly that.

Inside the Tellis





It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that,

Alignment is done via a key-way system, and the actuator at the bottom of the post, along with the remote itself, is designed to deliver a very light feel at the rider's thumb. Up top, a 3D forged head is home to a twin, opposing bolt system to clamp the seat rails, which is much more reliable than a single bolt running from left to right that'll eventually let the seat rotate backward.It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that, SDG has created a bunch of how-to videos that cover everything from a basic installation to a 400-hour service or a full cartridge replacement. That's how it should be done. SDG says that they wanted a dropper that's both reliable and simple to work on. The replacement cartridge goes for $44.99 USD.

The Tellis' lever can mount in just a single orientation: On the left and under the 'bar like a remote should be mounted.

With flawless reliability, simple construction, and a remote that requires next to no thumb pressure, the Tellis is a worthy dropper to consider.

Performance

Pinkbike's Take:

If the Tellis had been released four or five years ago, it would have been one of the only reliable options on the market and probably one of the least expensive. Things have moved on, however, and there are a handful of decent options to choose from these days, including SDG's now proven performer. The Tellis is relatively affordable compared to many other dropper posts, it's easy to install and, most importantly for many of us, it's demonstrated perfect reliability. — Mike Levy

There are loads of different dropper posts to pick from these days, but what isn't widely known is that many of them use the same, or at least very similar, hydraulic cartridge from Wintek to control their stroke. The cartridges are relatively inexpensive - SDG asks $44.99 USD for a new one - but they've also proven themselves to be pretty damn reliable. Sure, they're not serviceable for the most part, but is that a bad thing when they seem to run smoothly for ages? I don't think so, and the rest of the post is easy to service when the time comes.The Tellis' remote isn't one of those that can be mounted every which way to the point of it working on your drop bar-equipped recumbent. Instead, it's a simple thumb paddle that's designed to sit where your front shifter used to be back when dropping your seat meant getting off the bike. The clamp is split, of course, and the paddle sports a braille-like textured section for added traction.The cable is clamped at the lever (the head slots into the actuator at the bottom of the post) via a rather small set screw, and while it isn't the most elegant way to get the job done, it works.Besides slipping the cable's head into the actuator, then pulling it taut and clamping it, there isn't much to do. That first install took fifteen minutes, at most, and the tension hasn't needed any tinkering since.There was essentially no side-to-side play at the post's head when it was first put on the bike, and there still isn't any six months down the road. That bodes well for long-term performance, as does the smooth action and no hiccups at any point in the stroke. SDG says that the Tellis works well in temps as low as -20c, and while it never got that nippy, it does seem to be indifferent to what the weather is up to. The touch of top-out at the top of the stroke is nice, too, as it lets you know that it's back up to full mast.SDG touts a very light feel at the lever and they're not lying - the thumb paddle might depress if you blew on it. The shape of the cam is key here, and it'll be boon on any bike that has terrible cable routing that adds friction into the system from the bends being too tight. It should also help keep the lever moving decently when contamination has gotten into the line, although the real solution there is to do some maintenance.","It wasn't that long ago that you could count on your dropper post to stop going up and down sometime between when it was brand new and an hour into your first lap on it.

THE KIT

Since day one, we have been at the forefront of the MTB saddle game, supporting riders for over 20 years. While many are still onboard and riding today, they are having children of their own, which has shown us the need for quality youth components that were truly designed to fit smaller bodies. The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.
To see the faces on these kids receiving a kit and getting pumped on riding has been rewarding in itself.

The side event, convened by the UNFCCC Secretariat on 3 December, provided the opportunity to reflect on experiences gained and lessons learned over the 17 years of the CDM and discuss its continued relevance.

The CDM, a mechanism used by developed countries to help them meet their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol, has registered more than 8,100 projects and programmes in 111 developing countries, including those related to wind power, clean cookstoves and landfill gas. As an incentive, the CDM issues to project developers saleable credits, known as Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, for each tonne of CO2 they reduce or avoid.

In adopting the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to create tools to help meet the Paris goals, including a new market-based mechanism. Arguing that the CDM can play a role in the Paris Agreement, panelists, inter alia:

said excluding the CDM from the response to climate change would send a negative signal to the private sector and erode investor confidence in any future carbon mechanism;

credited the CDM with increasing political will that enabled the creation of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS);

said the CDM had delivered such co-benefits as improved indoor air quality and health benefits from efficient cookstove projects, job creation, increased access to electricity, and access to clean water;

emphasized the need for “something like the CDM” to stimulate and provide incentives for investment in emission reductions; and

highlighted CDM successes in Colombia and Brazil.

Participants also emphasized that not finding a place for the CDM in the new climate regime will mean lost infrastructure, with one noting that countries can use already existing capacity, or “we’ll have to create it all again in a few years.” The event discussed the report titled, ‘Achievements of the Clean Development Mechanism: Harnessing Incentive for Climate Action,’ which was published by the CDM Executive Board (EB) in August 2018 to mark the EB’s 100th meeting.

The Prime Minister of India in his statement at the Sustainable Development Summit in New York on 25 September 2015 strongly affirmed India’s commitment to Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. He drew attention to the fact that we live in “an age of unprecedented prosperity, but also unspeakable deprivation around the world” and pointed out that “much of India’s development agenda is mirrored in the Sustainable Development Goals”. Further, he has reiterated the importance of the SDGs at global level, such as at G-20 meetings. The Parliament of

India has taken exemplary initiatives to propel the SDG agenda forward. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Parliament of India, has organised briefing sessions on the SDGs for Members of Parliament, including bringing together legislators from South Asia and other BRICS nations to collectively work towards the realisation of these goals. India has provided strong endorsement to the SDGs, giving a considerable fillip to Agenda 2030.

Given the importance accorded by the Government of India to achieving SDGs, NITI Aayog decided to estimate the progress through a single measurable index that would serve as an advocacy tool and trigger action at the State level.

NITI Aayog has constructed the SDG India Index spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs (leaving out Goals 12, 13, 14 and 17). The Index tracks the progress of all the States and UTs on a set of 62 Priority Indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India. The SDG India Index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its States and UTs.

The SDG India Index is an aggregate measure which can be understood and used by everyone—policymakers, businesses, civil society and the general public. It has been designed to provide an aggregate assessment of the performance of all Indian States and UTs, and to help leaders and change makers evaluate their performance on social, economic and environmental parameters. It aims to measure India and its States’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030. The SDG India Index 2018 report provides critical insights on the status of SDGs in the country even though it may not be a comprehensive representation of overall baseline since it is constrained by limited data availability.

The Identified Goals under SGD India Index are as follows:

SDG 1. No Poverty

SDG 2. Zero Hunger

SDG 3. Good Health and Well-Being

SDG 4. Quality Education

SDG 5. Gender Equality

SDG 6. Clean Water And Sanitation

SDG 7. Affordable and Clean Energy

SDG 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth

SDG 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

SDG 10. Reduced Inequalities

SDG 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 12. Sustainable Consumption And Production

SDG 13. Climate Action

SDG 14. Life Below Water

SDG 15: Life on Land

SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

A break-up of SDG India Index score by the component Goals has been shown in the table alongside for each State and UT. The table can be read both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal view helps to gauge a State/UT’s performance across the 13 Goals. The vertical view enables a reader to compare the distance to target achieved by a State/UT relative to other States/UTs.

A composite score was computed for each State and UT of India based on their aggregate performance across 13 of the 17 SDGs. The value of the score indicates the average performance of the State/UT towards achieving the 13 SDGs and their respective targets. The score ranges between 0 and 100.

If a State achieves a score of 100, it signifies that the State has achieved the national target set for 2030. On the other hand, if a State achieves a score of 0, it signifies that the State was the worst performer.

The SDG Index Score for Sustainable Development Goals 2030 ranges between 42 and 69 for States and between 57 and and 68 for UTs. Among the States, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh are the front runners with an SDG India Index score of 69. Among the UTs, Chandigarh is a front runner with a score of 68.

Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its superior performance in providing good health, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. Himachal Pradesh ranks high on providing clean water and sanitation, in reducing inequalities and preserving mountain ecosystem.","NITI Aayog has constructed the SDG India Index spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs (leaving out Goals 12, 13, 14 and 17).

“It started out when he was really tiny,” said St. Denis. “He loved to feed the animals. What we do at home is we have a fake tree that we put on the porch and we put carrots and everything on it and he gets to feed the animals.”

St. Denis said they then started to talk about the animals that didn’t have homes and she asked Richer if he wanted to do something for them.

“I explained it to him and he said, ‘oh yea,’” she said.

One of the things Richer loves about donating to the animal shelter is he also gets to go and check out the animals that are still there. All decked out in elf ears and Christmas themed clothes, the family and friends dropped off bags and bags of treats, food and toys for the animals.","Article contentIt all started with a little boy’s love for animals.

This was stated in the NITI Aayog report released on December 21 titled ‘SDG India Index Baseline Report, 2018.’

The government’s premier think tank developed the country’s first SDG India Index to document the progress made by India’s states and Union Territories towards meeting SDG targets and released a baseline report for 2018.

The SDG India Index was constructed spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs (leaving out Goals 12, 13, 14 and 17). The Index tracks the progress of all the States and Union Territories (UTs) on a set of 62 Priority Indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India. The SDG India Index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its States and UTs.

Each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are mapped with a set of 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. These were used as the foundation for building the SDG India Index.

A composite score was computed for each State and UT of India based on their aggregate performance across 13 of the 17 SDGs. The value of the score indicates the average performance of the State/UT towards achieving the 13 SDGs and their respective targets. The score ranges between 0 and 100.

It may be mentioned that if a State achieves a score of 100, it signifies that the State has achieved the national target set for 2030. On the other hand, if a State achieves a score of 0, it signifies that the State was the worst performer.

Target settings and its scores are Achiever (100), Front Runner (65-99), Performer (50-69) and lastly Aspirant (0-49). As per the SDG Index Score of States and UTs, Nagaland stands at a total score of 51 which fall under the ‘Performer’ category.

In the break-up of SDG India Index score by component goals, Nagaland is one of the three worst performers under Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure category with a Zero score. The other two states with zero score include Mizoram and Goa.

However, majority of the States and UTs have fallen behind on this Goal with 26 States and UTs in the ‘Aspirant’ category (with Index score less than 50).

In SDG Index Score for the Goal of Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Nagaland is also among the last three worst performers with a score of 40 with Manipur the lowest with a score of 33 and Jammu & Kashmir at 43.

Under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Good Health and Well-being, Nagaland is again has one of the lowest score (34) under the ‘Aspirant’ category.

However, under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Peace, Justice and Strong, Nagaland is one of the ‘Front Runner’ with a score of 87. Under the Goal of Zero Hunger, Nagaland was accorded 69 points which also falls under the same category. In Goal of Clean Water and Sanitation, Nagaland stood at 58.

The SDG Index Score for the Goal of Reduced Inequalities for Nagaland stood at 80 which fall under the ‘Front Runner’ category, while Meghalaya, Mizoram and Telangana were the only three states which were deemed as ‘Achiever.’

In general, from among the states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have come out as the front runners in implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets.

Along with the three states, the UTs of Chandigarh and Puducherry were also among the front runners on the SDG India Index with a score between 65 to 99 on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 signifies that it has achieved the 2030 national targets.

These two new ambulances, and every ambulance to be purchased going forward will have a new Stryker Power-Load System and new blue emergency lighting systems on the front and back.

The new power lift system lifts the ambulance stretcher and the patient into the ambulance and locks it in place without effort from the paramedics.

“This is a new safety system for paramedics and patients,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall and SDG Paramedics. “Until now, the paramedics had to lift all of the weight.”

Lister explained that the stretcher weighs 100 pounds, and that their average patient weighs 190 pounds, but that the new power-load system can lift up to 700 pounds.

The new power-load system will reduce the annual lifting load of paramedics by over 10 million pounds a year.

The new lighting system on the ambulances replaces the traditional red-white emergency lights on the front and back of the vehicle with a red-blue combo.

“Many studies have shown that the blue lights are more noticeable and effective in difficult weather situations like fog, rain and snow,” said Lister.

The Stryker Power-Load System costs $27,000 each and the new emergency lighting system will cost $600 each. Right now, only the two newest ambulances are equipped with these systems. Cornwall and SDG Paramedics replace an ambulance every 54 months and their goal is to have their entire fleet of 14 ambulances equipped with these systems within four years.","CORNWALL, Ontario – The Cornwall and SDG Paramedics Service unveiled two new ambulances on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018 that come with two new features that promise to increase the safety of paramedics and patients.
