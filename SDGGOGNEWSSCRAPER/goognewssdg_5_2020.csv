His announcements included the co-facilitators he has appointed for several processes: preparations for the Biodiversity Summit, preparations for the Second Ocean Conference, preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary, and the intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

Bridging that gap requires removing the constraints to the supply of, and demand for, capital.

Development banks must focus on catalysing new sources of financing.

Despite a tremendous increase in the number of initiatives dedicated to sustainable development since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, a persistent $2.5 trillion annual financing gap stands in the way of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The international community has committed to turn promises into reality as we enter the “decade of action and delivery”, acknowledging that the progress made so far has been very slow in many areas.

The first step in financing the SDGs is to ensure that capital is actually deployed where it has true sustainable development impact. Global GDP in 2018 amounted to an estimated $85 trillion. This means that if only 3% of the global GDP was invested for sustainable development, the world would be able to close the SDGs financing gap – the global community would be able to meet our sustainability ambitions and collectively achieve the 2030 Agenda.

Many obstacles, however, stand in the way. The Global Future Council on Development Finance, convened by the World Economic Forum and comprising 24 experts active in the field, is focusing on innovative ways to overcome the systemic challenges that limit the flow of development finance. For the Davos Annual Meeting 2020, we created the new Development Finance Transformation Map, summarizing the key dimensions characterizing the ecosystem.

The Council brings together representatives from national governments, donors, multilateral and bilateral development finance institutions (DFIs), private investors, finance leaders and academia. It believes that conventional approaches to development finance are inadequate to address the market failures that manifest themselves at the national level. This is why the action taken so far has not achieved the scale and speed needed to mobilize the capital required for the SDGs.

With a focus on identifying solutions, the Council recognizes that enhanced action is needed from all participants – the providers of capital (supply), the users of capital (demand) and the institutions that link the two (intermediaries) – while also realizing that only limited progress will be achieved if those areas are explored in silos, given how interconnected they are.

An integrated approach that considers how all elements interact is needed. This approach is one where public and private stakeholders at a global and domestic level work together to bridge the SDG financing gap, achieving more than they could on their own. Furthermore, for global thought leadership to have an impact on the ground, it must be harnessed to action at a country level, allowing the system to work in sync and achieve the speed and scale required to move the needle in the decade of action.

Supply side: aggregate investment opportunities to attract more capital

The private sector seeks investment opportunities that match return expectations and risk appetite. Weak global economic growth forecasts and the proliferation of negative yield bonds mean that projects in developing and emerging economies that contribute to the SDGs should be offering attractive investment opportunities.

However, market failures disincentivize private participation in financing the SDGs. High levels of perceived risk, local currency volatility, information asymmetries between capital providers and project developers and deal size – to name a few – often transform what might be an attractive investment opportunity into a very complex deal where the final expected return does not justify the risk and effort that the investor must undertake to deploy the capital.

Consider an example: Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) represent a group of 58 island countries that face similar development challenges related to vulnerability to natural disasters, need for climate change resilience and their small size. Though SIDS have urgent needs for new sources of capital to finance their 2030 Agenda plans, they find themselves struggling to attract private sector investment given their high perceived risk and lack of projects with scalable returns.

The Council is developing a framework to help SIDS attract capital and overcome their size problem through the use of aggregation vehicles at the country, regional or sectoral levels. These vehicles can group smaller investment solutions into larger opportunities that can more easily attract private capital. This could develop into a viable mechanism for SIDS to find new sources of capital for the SDGs.

Demand side: take a strategic approach to using all types of capital

Market failures also stem from the demand side. One such source of inefficiency is the lack of coherent strategic development planning: countries should link their national allocation processes to the SDGs and create a national financing plan for the 2030 Agenda.

Governments must move away from a confined project-by-project approach towards a holistic financing strategy for the SDGs, involving all sources of capital across the various stages of the investment value chain.

During its previous term, the Global Future Council on Development Finance recommended that countries should pivot from “funding” to “financing”, thereby moving away from relying on official development assistance (ODA) and other public funding, and instead clearly mapping the right type of capital for each project, having a holistic consideration of all the capital sources – domestic, international, private and public capital – that could be deployed at a national level.

Moreover, the Council believes that governments can make or break the attractiveness of a country for investors. By fostering a sense of “investable governance” and creating an enabling environment that boosts investors’ confidence the country can set itself up for success.

For instance, implementing a regulatory framework that attracts private investors through business-friendly policies will enhance further business investment. To achieve this, multi-stakeholder collaboration is essential so that the public and private sector can align on the right type of action needed to improve a country’s investable governance.

The changes will only have a lasting impact if they build on the consensus of both public and private stakeholders and therefore allow the country to stick to an overall governance framework that continues to support domestic and international investors operating in the country.

Intermediary institutions: act as the catalysts in the interest of the countries

The supply and demand dynamics outlined above will unfold within an existing development finance landscape, and it is crucial that the relevant intermediary institutions improve their ability to link the supply of, and demand for, capital for SDGs. This requires a fundamental reassessment of the role of various development financiers and other stakeholders.

In particular, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Regional Development Banks (RDBs), National Development Banks (NDBs) and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) should prioritize their role as catalysts that help countries move from “funding” to “financing”, embracing a change some institutions have already started.

As countries pivot away from a “project by project” approach to strategic efforts to create private markets and attract a diverse set of capital providers, intermediaries should enhance their ability to bring investors and countries together. This requires a deeper understanding of the different types of capital that are needed for achieving the SDGs (all the way up from standard project financing to the most impactful type of equity risk capital) and an ability to work well with both the public and private sector.

The Council believes that it is crucial for existing intermediaries to focus on catalysing new sources of financing including from pension funds, insurance companies, and retail investors that have traditionally not been active suppliers of SDG financing.

This involves mobilizing private financing at different stages of the project lifecycle. For example, MDBs have had a tendency to focus on deploying their own capital in their own bespoke projects and keeping that capital tied up throughout the life of the project.

MDBs should find a way to bring in more private investors alongside them at the start of the project and then subsequently attract additional more risk-averse investors by allowing a refinancing of the MDB financing once the project has been derisked. This would help mobilize a whole new class of SDG investors and also enable the MDBs to recycle their own capital more efficiently.

MDBs could use their comparative expertise to identify more bankable projects while also making it easier for private financiers to get involved. There is an urgent need to attract more private investment in sustainable development in middle and low-income countries where MDBs and DFIs in 2018 jointly mobilized only $69 billion across the globe.

Conclusions

In Davos, members of the Global Future Council on Development Finance will meet with representatives of both the public and private sectors to engage them in reigniting the energy required to meet the ambitious targets of the Decade of Delivery.","For the Davos Annual Meeting 2020, we created the new Development Finance Transformation Map, summarizing the key dimensions characterizing the ecosystem.

The framework “builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020” and aims to bring about a “transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled.”

The ‘Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’ requested at its first meeting that a zero draft text of the global biodiversity framework be provided six weeks prior to its second meeting, which will be held 24-28 February in Kunming, China.

Speaking on the zero draft, the Open Working Group Co-chairs, Basile Van Havre and Francis Ogwal, pointed out that they, “tried to create a framework for all, one that sets the stage for an inspirational, ambitious, realistic, and achievable framework.”

The proposed framework, published on 13 January, comprises background information, an introduction, and a draft recommendation for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting. These are followed by two annexes the contain, respectively, the initial draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the consideration of the Working Group, and elements of a draft recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifteenth meeting. The document is complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework and a glossary of terms.

The framework presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and each of these goals has an associated outcome for 2030. The five goals address net loss and ecosystem resilience; reductions in the percentage of species threatened with extinction; the maintenance and enhancement of genetic diversity; the benefits of nature to people; and increasing the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five goals. The 20 targets are presented under the categories of reducing threats to biodiversity; meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming.

The draft includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. It considers elements of guidance on goals, SMART targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss and for achieving transformational change. It also “takes into account the various consultation processes that have been undertaken, including the views expressed during the informal briefing by the Co-Chairs on 24 November 2019, which presented a preliminary overview of the zero draft of the framework.”

The Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

Something’s happening here

This commitment to the SDGs has become, in the words of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a matter of “civic pride and civic well-being,” manifesting rather rapidly. In the summer and fall of 2018, my conversations with city workers and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) colleagues about the SDGs were filled with curiosity but also reservations; just a few months later, the same colleagues were surprised to acknowledge that wherever they went, “SDG talk was in the air.” By the fall of 2019, Mayor Peduto and the provost of CMU had each made public commitments related to the SDGs—the city to complete a Voluntary Local Review (VLR), and CMU to complete a first-of-its-kind Voluntary University Review (VUR), of which I am admittedly a champion as a co-chair of the CMU’s Sustainability Initiative.

Development is not something that happens only elsewhere or just in the global south. It happens everywhere.

VLRs are relatively new phenomena where cities use the SDGs to nudge, align, commit, and report how their localities are making progress toward achieving the goals. While VLRs take their inspiration from the national reviews that countries present at the U.N., they are an innovation with no official blueprint, so cities have a lot of leeway in how they do this work.

This is even more true for universities; while there is a lot of progress in many universities around green practices, to our knowledge, there has never been a VUR using the full SDG framework. This spring and summer, CMU will engage in an exercise to see what students, faculty, and staff are doing in terms of education, research, and practice that align with the SDGs. It will initially be a stocktaking exercise that we expect will lead to elevating existing work as well as generating new areas of engagement, collaboration, and most important, solutions to society’s most challenging problems.

Interestingly, in making these announcements about the SDG reviews, both the city government and the university were joining a movement that had already begun growing organically in Pittsburgh, picking up significant momentum throughout 2019. The private sector began last year with commitments around sustainability. Numerous nonprofits were already hard at work and in some cases gaining international recognition. Local philanthropy is pivoting as well as several other local universities.

The efforts in Pittsburgh underscore the SDGs’ paradigm shift in how to think about both development and sustainability in the 21st century. Namely, they recognize that development is not something that happens only elsewhere or just in the global south. It happens everywhere. Pittsburgh has long-standing patterns of inequities and inequalities across race and gender it must address—as do many communities in the United States. Black women in Pittsburgh are twice as likely to experience fetal mortality than white women in Pittsburgh. Most striking, Black fetal mortality in Pittsburgh is higher than Black fetal mortality in 94 percent of similar cities. Notably, Pittsburgh’s Black adult women are five times more likely than white adult men to live in poverty.

If citizens sit back and wait for their national government or policymakers to make a move on the SDGs—especially here and now in the U.S.—they will miss out entirely on the benefits of this agenda.

In this work, the “sustainability” in the SDG framework includes but goes beyond environmental and climate-related issues. It involves not only equity but also the need to reduce violence, exemplified by the mayor’s efforts to change gun procurement following the mass atrocity in 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue. It requires the participation of citizens, and especially listening to the perspectives of young people belonging to “Cohort 2030,” the generation born after 1980 that has the most to gain or lose by how robustly we implement the SDG agenda. And yes, it includes greener buildings, much of which Pittsburgh is doing through the Green Building Alliance. The SDGs, when comprehensively implemented, bring these elements together.

What are lessons for other cities interested in the SDGs?

Alignment is the first step. Pittsburgh is still in the early days of its SDG journey. First steps include mapping who is doing what on issues that align with and possibly contribute to the SDGs. Much is already in the works, from the University of Pittsburgh’s new Center on Sustainable Business launched in October 2019 to the December 2019 announcement that a local grocery chain would be ending single-use plastic bags.

At CMU, as a first step in creating our VUR, we are embarking on efforts to establish a baseline of what the CMU community knows and cares about concerning the SDGs, collecting data from every CMU campus including Adelaide, Doha, Kigali, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and Washington, DC, as well as Pittsburgh. Landscaping, however it is done, will be vital to reveal hidden connections, neglected issues, as well as areas of excellence. It will help set priorities and commitments, and different entities—cities, universities, philanthropies, the private sector—will have different methods for embracing challenges and opportunities.

“The SDG effect” suggests promise but also needs to show impact. Pittsburgh offers an excellent place to observe the unfolding of what we hypothesize will be generally known as “the SDG effect.” By aligning city plans, educational institutions’ strategic priorities, advocacy work, private sector practice, and philanthropic resources with the SDGs, we will be able to measure and demonstrate impact and outcomes. For example, by aligning with global campaigns around cutting in half all forms of violence by 2030, we can make meaningful progress locally as well as become part of a community of practice globally. In any case, making the SDG effect real—and frankly, making it reasonably soon—will necessitate the actions of the mayor’s teams, but also the private sector, young people, universities, and local foundations, working collaboratively to create a more peaceful, prosperous Pittsburgh for all Pittsburghers.

Sustainability is about more than climate. Like many American cities, Pittsburgh has suffered a mass casualty event, and some citizens experience serious issues of inequity and inequality daily. It is not hard to make the case to Pittsburghers that the 21st century definition of sustainable development encompasses political, social, and economic issues as well as environmental ones. Progress on all fronts is interconnected.

Responsibility rests with all stakeholders and citizens. While there is much enthusiasm, there is more work to be done raising awareness and increasing literacy about the SDGs—reinforcing the message that they be locally owned, and that in 2020, we are beginning “the decade of action” to achieve the SDGs by 2030. In fact, perhaps the most important takeaway from the emerging Pittsburgh Platform is that responsibility for making progress on the agenda rests simultaneously in many sectors with multiple stakeholders. If citizens sit back and wait for their national government or policymakers to make a move on the SDGs—especially here and now in the U.S.—they will miss out entirely on the benefits of this agenda.

Local leadership matters to advance the global goals. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that support from leaders in institutions embracing the framework is also critical to signal prioritization, create momentum, align resources, and push back on naysayers and cynics. Regardless of how difficult this shared work will be, the imperatives to move the ball decisively on equity, on violence, and on the very viability of the planet suggest there is no Plan B.

As young people around the world remind us each day, business as usual is not an option. If, in the last decade, globalization led to alienation and the rise of populism in many places, in this next decade, the global agenda has to be applied locally by local leaders so no one is again left behind.","Across sectors, people are finding value in this framework to tackle tough issues that have long plagued postindustrial cities like Pittsburgh.

The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.

The report frames the global economy as facing increased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.

The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.

The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.

Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.

The World Economic Forum will convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

The compendium features country case studies from Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru.

The ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems’ was launched at the Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration, which took place from 14-18 October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. In September 2019, a synthesis report of the six case studies was introduced at a side event during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

One billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation.

According to the compendium, current birth registration coverage is not adequate to meet SDG target 16.9, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. It reports that: the average birth registration rate globally is 73%; only 46% children in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered; and only 25% of the world population live in countries where more than 90% of the births and deaths are registered, most of these countries being high-income countries. The authors also note that according to the latest data from the World Bank, 1 billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation. The World Bank has also found that approximately 50% of the world’s deaths are not registered.

The compendium aims to provide evidence and raise awareness of the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management, where civil registration and identity management systems support each other. The publication is also aimed at shedding light, for civil registration authorities, of the opportunities for advancing CRVS and increasing registration coverage through tighter cooperation or integration with identity management systems and other “identity ecosystem” actors.

The compendium focuses on the experiences of six countries that have pursued a holistic approach to CRVS: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru. The case studies reflect varied experiences in building identity ecosystems with different constitutional and legal systems, administrative traditions and institutional arrangements. The studies present good practices, underlining how the countries’ different starting points were not an obstacle to building their identity system around a holistic approach, as well as their various ways of working.

Five recurring messages were identified across the six case studies:

A strong CRVS system that registers all vital events from birth until death for the whole population is an essential precondition for the implementation of a holistic identity system;

Other components of an identity ecosystem, including the issuance of identification credentials and functional government systems, rely on civil registration records as the only source of up-to-date identity data;

The digitization of CRVS and identity management systems, together with other government functional systems, enables more efficient ways for processing identity information;

The benefits of a holistic approach span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption and leaving no one behind; and

The four key elements essential to a conducive enabling environment for pursuing a holistic identity system are: political commitment; a legal framework that enables data sharing; a data privacy and protection framework; and technology ownership from the outset to mitigate possible vendor lock-in.

The six case studies (Armenia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru) also show that technical interoperability provides a range of benefits in ensuring that all categories of population from birth to death reflect their identity information in the system.

The survey is part of a consultation process that will inform the UN’s 75th anniversary in September 2020.

The UN describes the process as a “global reality check” and the “largest, most inclusive conversation on the role of global cooperation in building a better future for all.” It aims to gather the views of, in particular, youth and other groups not already engaged with the UN.

One format the conversation will take is a survey launched on 1 January 2020, consisting of five questions:

Overall, do you think that people in 2045 will be better off, worse off, or the same as you are today? (Choose one.)

If you picture the world you want in 25 years, what three things would you most want to see? (Choices include “better management of international migration,” “more environmental protection,” “more employment opportunities,” “greater equality between men and women” and “better access to healthcare.”)

Which of these global trends do you think will most affect our future? (Choices include risks related to terrorism, health and new technologies; climate change and environmental issues; nuclear weapons; forced displacement; and breakdown of relations between countries.)

How important – or not – is it for countries to work together to manage the above trends? (Five-point scale from “Not important at all” to “Essential.”)

What would you advise the UN Secretary-General to do to address these global trends? (Write up to 140 characters.)

Users are informed that responses “will help improve international management of these trends, and put us in a better position to meet our aspirations for a brighter global future in 2045 – when the United Nations will turn 100.” In addition to the one-minute survey, the UN75 dialogues will include opinion polling in 50 countries, and artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment analysis including through social media, in 70 countries. The resulting data will be provided to inform national and international policies and debate, according to the UN.

The UN Secretary-General will present the ideas generated by the process during a high-level event to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020. The theme of this event will be, ‘The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism,’ as agreed by UN Member States in June 2019. This theme also will guide all other activities, meetings and conferences organized by the UN in 2020, including the general debate of the UNGA’s 75th session.

8,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/2020s-buzzword-is-nature/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: 2020's Buzzword is Nature,"The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending. Relatable, universal, and cross-cutting, Nature will be a dominant and uniting theme for many of the milestone events leading up to the adoption of a new, post-2020 framework for biodiversity in October.

With half of humanity living in urban areas, where biodiversity often comes in the forms of roaches, rats, monkeys, and mosquitoes, any push to save the planet needs a concept everyone can embrace. The messaging this year will be broad and it will be accessible. From slum to skyscraper, Nature is all around. Air to breathe, fresh water and food. A stunning sunset. A vicious storm. Nature envelopes us, and for better or worse, it ‘leaves no one behind.’ Communications will encourage the reconnection of people to Nature, like for instance the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ (IPBES) emphasis on ‘Nature’s Contributions to People.’

Going into 2020, data show that we won’t achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Aichi Targets by their deadline in December. Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May. Last year, the IPBES Global Assessment of the State of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service report, which will serve as the scientific basis of the post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations, informed that approximately a million species are a risk of extinction and that nature continues to decline due to human activities. The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.

Perhaps a wider and softer net – one woven by Mother Nature herself – can help. Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies. This has long been a CBD priority, with the Convention dedicating its 2018 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors – recognizing that these sectors depend on nature’s contributions. Without a doubt, the plight of biodiversity must be universally understood and addressed, if humanity is to solve the ecological crisis. As the 2019 World Economic Forum, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund are saying, it’s time for a “New Deal for Nature.”

Further, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation has demanded an end to siloed development approaches and encouraged a focus on the linkages between the environmental, economic and social aspects of development. No more is biodiversity to be considered in a vacuum – not if it is to be truly integrated into the universally agreed, global development platform. Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework. Nature’s systems, of which biodiversity is a critical component, sustain life on Earth and offer a touchstone for the achievement of all the Goals. Nature is cross-cutting.

The theme for biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity.

When the CBD does convene its COP in October to adopt the post-2020 biodiversity framework, it will do so under the theme of ‘Ecological Civilizations: Building a Shared Future for all Life on Earth.’ Note that the theme for the biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity. Instead it links people (civilizations) to nature (ecology). Ecology is the branch of biology dealing with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. By its theme, the CBD COP won’t just be talking about conserving biodiversity for biodiversity’s sake. It will be talking about the core of humanity – our civilizations – and their relationship to the natural world all around. It is an approach that strikes an additional nail into the coffin of siloed approaches to conservation.

The other major biodiversity-related COP in 2020, that of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in February, will also have ecology at the heart of its theme. For its part, the CMS will present the concept of ‘Ecological Connectivity,’ which it defines as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.” With a concept that links the migration of species to the sustenance of all life on Earth, the CMS is calling for both an Ecological Connectivity stand-alone target as well as integration of the concept into other relevant targets of the new biodiversity framework.’ Will the bigger pictures sync? Can our “ecological civilizations” be “ecologically connected”?

In addition to ecology, nature-based solutions are also likely to feature in the big biodiversity-related and climate meetings this year. These approaches, which offer a linked way to incorporate biodiversity considerations into multidimensional development problems, rose to global attention in 2019. They were stressed in parallel to the Climate Action Summit, especially with regard to forests, as well as at the UN Convention on Desertification COP (UNCCD COP 14) and the High-level Panel on Oceans, during Climate Week. Nature-based solutions have been framed as a way to address multiple priorities at once – for instance mangroves offer protection from climate-related disasters like storm surges, while fostering the biodiversity that supports fisheries (food and employment) and sequestering carbon.

In announcing the theme of the next World Environment Day, which will take place in June 2020 and focus on biodiversity, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, “2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action.” It is likely that nature-based solutions will also receive attention at the forthcoming meetings of the World Conservation Congress, the second UN Ocean Conference, and the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

As a final point of reference for the 2020 word of the year, when world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they will have an opportunity to participate in a ‘Nature Summit.’ The meeting will offer one more step towards achieving the CBD’s long-term (2050) Vision of ‘Living in Harmony with Nature.’

We are all touched by her hand, and for the Biodiversity Super Year, we will see that our hope lies in Nature.","The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

The Peru study reports that after operating a disperse system of civil registration and an identification system closely tied to electoral purposes for more than 100 years, in 1993 Peru established a single national agency in charge of both functions, el Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil (RENIEC). Since then, RENIEC has articulated a decentralized system, increasing the coverage of vital events registration, identifying citizens, and integrating CRVS and identity management systems. The integration was realized through establishing standard processes and guidelines, introducing digital technology, and digitizing civil registration and identification records.

Throughout the integration process, RENIEC has increased collaboration between public and private organizations through the exchange of data, and has become Peru’s primary resource for identity authentication. The case study notes that, in order to make civil registration the backbone of identity management, RENIEC focused its efforts on:

Constitutional independence and autonomy;

Digitized records;

Information exchange between public and private sectors;

Integration strategies combined with information technology; and

Online services at health facilities for birth and death certification and registration.

To reflect the benefits of CRVS and ID management, the publication highlights the example of nutrition subsidies where the integration improved service provision and saved time and money: RENIEC has ensured that more newborns get nutrition support in time by reducing the application process from two months to 72 hours, and reaching 71% of beneficiaries within the first month, up from 36%.

As data gaps in registration still remain, especially related to the most vulnerable segments of the population, RENIEC has taken measures to improve services for Indigenous communities, set inter-institutional alliances and cooperation, and launch mobile registration units.

The publication also notes that, as part of the efforts to serve Indigenous communities, the Identity Restitution and Social Support Department is developing a project to provide customized training to civil registrars in Indigenous communities. As Peru has 48 Indigenous languages that are spoken by approximately 16% of the population, since 2014 RENIEC has worked to promote the use of Indigenous languages in civil registration services. The institution also provides an online registration platform, civil registry books, civil registration forms, dissemination and training material, and certified copies of civil registration records in Indigenous languages. These measures have helped reduce registration errors, promote inclusion, reduce under-registration, and contribute to reaching the SDG target 16.9.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia and Netherlands. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

The NDC Support Facility for Efficient, Climate-Friendly Cooling was launched on 27 January 2020, by the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (K-CEP), a philanthropic initiative to support the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, with a focus on the energy efficiency of cooling. The new Facility will advance cooling solutions in a way that complements the Kigali Amendment, which aims to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

The K-CEP press release explains that the demand for cooling is expected to rise dramatically with the anticipated rise in global temperatures, and the global energy demand for air conditioning will triple by 2050. More efficient, climate-friendly options for cooling are needed; otherwise, K-CEP says, “the emissions from cooling could use up most of the remaining carbon budget required to achieve the Paris target of staying below a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures within the next few decades.”

The NDC Support Facility plans to award up to USD 12 million to organizations to provide technical assistance and other support to eligible Article 5 countries (including Kigali Amendment Group 2 countries such as India) that are making new cooling commitments in their strengthened NDCs for COP 26. Up to USD 5 million of this total is earmarked for proposals requesting technical assistance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to improve the energy efficiency of air-conditioning equipment, and USD 3.2 million will be dedicated to helping communities that are most at risk from a lack of access to cooling.

By 2060, the global building floor area is expected to double. Emerging and developing economies in warm and tropical climates will experience the biggest increase.

Already today, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sector consumes over a third of global final energy. Energy demand from the building sector is expected to grow by another 50% by 2050. Space cooling is a key driver of this demand – energy needs for space cooling are expected to triple.

Buildings cause greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both when they are built, and over their long lifetime of 30 to 80 years. Our modern way of constructing is mostly based on concrete, using standard blueprints regardless of the climate. This leads to high energy bills for those who can afford it, and economic and health risks for those who cannot.

Future-proofing Buildings Can Drive SDGs 1, 7, 11

Energy-efficient buildings are not rocket science. Improvements in the building’s outer structure and appliances can achieve substantial energy savings compared to standard buildings. Measures to future-proof buildings can range from “low-tech,” such as painting roofs in light colors and ensuring natural shade, to digital solutions for building design and management. Additional macro-economic benefits include energy security, job creation and health. And from a business perspective future proofed buildings have a lower lifetime cost and higher asset values.

Climate action in buildings and construction is among the most cost-effective measures. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that realizing the potential of sustainable buildings will save USD 1.1 trillion by 2050.

Nevertheless, this transition requires a shift in investment. USD 4.5 trillion are invested into real estate every year. To channel this investment towards energy efficiency, we need to influence it from two directions: ambitious policy and regulation serving as a “stick,” and financing as a “carrot.”

The Programme for Energy Efficiency in Buildings (PEEB), a French-German initiative, works with its first five partner countries – Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Vietnam – to transform the building sector. PEEB combines financing energy efficiency in large-scale projects with technical assistance through policy advice. PEEB mobilizes innovative financing solutions for large building projects. For example, in Morocco PEEB supports the government in mobilising EUR 20 million in climate financing for a residential housing programme. A green loan programme for young families is in the making in Vietnam. The programme also works with partners to make policies and standards more ambitious and effective, through better enforcement of existing green building codes or setting standards for sectors like hotels or hospitals.

All of these advancements are helping to achieve 2030 Agenda targets on energy, housing and poverty.

Climate Action in the Building Sector is Gaining Momentum

Another international agreement – the Paris Agreement on climate change – also hangs in the balance; its goals will not be achieved without a climate focus for buildings in the new decade. A rapid decarbonization needs to happen in the building sector, driven by international and national actors.

In 2019, action on buildings took center stage. Led by the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), buildings featured prominently at the climate change conference COP25 in Madrid, with topics ranging from zero carbon buildings to circular economy approaches in the buildings sector. The Global Status Report on Buildings and Construction confirmed the urgent need for action in the building sector. At the Climate Action Summit convened by the United Nations in September 2019, the Net Zero Carbon initiative was launched to leverage the leadership of governments, industry and civil society to commit to ambitious targets and mobilize funding. The Cool Coalition and SEforALL’s Cooling for All initiative have incorporated buildings as a key element of their strategies.

As we head into 2020, buildings are high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has named moving towards zero carbon buildings as one of its four top priorities for tackling climate change. The report by the UK government on energy transitions features buildings as a key sector. The lead-up to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) in 2020 has an unprecedented opportunity to raise the ambition of all actors to make our buildings future-proof and wake this sleeping giant.

For example, forests are critical for climate change mitigation and for sustaining global biodiversity; they provide timber and non-timber forest products as well as pollination services that are critical for sustaining agricultural production. Forests can be directly or indirectly linked to each of the SDGs and the future of the world’s forests is critical for sustainable development at all scales, from global to local.

Little attention, however, has yet focused on how efforts towards achieving the SDGs will impact forests and forest-related livelihoods, and how these impacts may, in turn, enhance or undermine the contributions of forests to climate and development. Understanding the potential impacts of SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development as well as the related trade-offs and synergies is crucial for the efforts undertaken to reach these goals. It is especially important for reducing potential negative impacts and to leverage opportunities to create synergies that will ultimately determine whether comprehensive progress towards the SDGs will be made.

The book Sustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People by IUFRO WFSE (International Union of Forest Research Organizations’ special project World Forest, Society and Environment) provides a comprehensive assessment of potential and anticipated impacts of efforts towards attaining the different SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development. The development of this book involved 120 scientists and experts from 60 different universities and research and development organizations as well as 38 scientists who acted as peer reviewers of the 17 SDG chapters.

This book discusses the conditions that influence how SDGs are implemented and prioritized, and provides a systematic, multidisciplinary global assessment of interlinkages among the SDGs and their targets, increasing understanding of potential synergies and unavoidable trade-offs between goals from the point of view of forests and people.

The SDGs include partially conflicting visions for forests and people, making it necessary to consider trade-offs and to set priorities. National circumstances and development priorities influence how the SDGs are prioritized and how they are included in national strategies and policies. Measures taken to implement the SDGs vary according to economic prosperity, political stability, social cohesion, level of technological development and policy, institutional and social frameworks as well as geographic features and the natural resource base. The extent and condition of forest resources and the role of forests in industrial development and for livelihoods largely determine the relative importance given to forests in relation to other land uses. Social and cultural perspectives also play a key role, as do the values and interests of different actors in society, and their representation and voice pertaining to forest related decision making. These conditions greatly influence how synergies can be leveraged and unavoidable trade-offs mitigated.

There is large potential for synergies among the SDGs and their targets and the implementation of several SDGs can be beneficial for both forests and people. For example, SDG 13 (Climate action) should lead to more sustainable forest management and conservation as well as forest restoration. Improved resource efficiency, sustainable production and new technologies under SDG 12 (Sustainable production and consumption) and increased agricultural productivity for reaching food security (SDG 2) can also reduce pressures on forests. The interlinkage between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and forests relates to water availability and water quality. Generally forests have a positive impact on water quality. This favors maintaining forest cover and increasing cover in protected or degraded catchments. A focus on water efficiency, however, may restrict the establishment of new forest plantations in semi-arid areas.

For sustaining and enhancing forests’ contributions to achieving SDGs, it is also important to focus attention on participatory governance, the regulatory framework, the accountability and transparency of institutions, access to markets and finances, education and enhancing social capital. These issues have been found to contribute to an enabling environment for inclusive forest management and conservation with associated livelihood benefits. All these issues are also included in the SDGs and advancing towards them will support sustainable forest-related development and livelihoods.

On the other hand, efforts to advance towards some SDGs can affect land use directly and are thus expected to directly impact forests and pose serious threats to forests and the people living in or near them. For example, SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) may encourage infrastructure development and other activities which lead to forest loss. The expansion of agricultural crops for food or energy (SDG 2 Food security and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy) is also likely to compete with forests in many locations.

It is crucially important that the potential trade-offs implicit in the SDGs with respect to forests and other land uses are recognized, understood and made transparent to societies, and that the forest–people interconnectedness is fully accounted for in societal and policy decisions. This must include thinking across different scales and generations. When the implementation of SDGs and targets may have negative outcomes on forests and people alternative options that contribute to social development and forest conservation should be developed, or measures should be taken to reduce negative outcomes, for example by limiting infrastructure development to protect valuable biodiversity, other environmental values and indigenous people’s way of life.

In view of the diversity of forest-related societal needs, viewpoints, cultural values and interests different groups should have access to the SDG-related decision-making and implementation processes at all levels and these processes should be perceived by everyone as transparent, fair and effective. It is vitally important that all the relevant stakeholders, especially women, indigenous peoples and marginalized groups, are involved in the design and implementation of the SDGs.

Capturing the potential of forests and trees for sustainable development requires that they are integrated in efforts and measures undertaken to reach the SDGs and specific targets. In this process harnessing opportunities for beneficial synergies and mitigating trade-offs among the SDGs and their targets is of utmost importance. The implementation of the SDGs and associated goals and targets will also require continuous learning and adaptation of implementation strategies and approaches, but possibly also targets, taking into consideration observed outcomes.

Dr. Pia Katila is a senior scientist at Natural Resources Institute Finland and the coordinator of IUFRO WFSE (IUFRO special project World Forests, Society and Environment, https://www.iufro.org/science/special/wfse/)","Forests can be directly or indirectly linked to each of the SDGs and the future of the world’s forests is critical for sustainable development at all scales, from global to local.
There is large potential for synergies among the SDGs and their targets and the implementation of several SDGs can be beneficial for both forests and people.
For example, SDG 13 (Climate action) should lead to more sustainable forest management and conservation as well as forest restoration.
Improved resource efficiency, sustainable production and new technologies under SDG 12 (Sustainable production and consumption) and increased agricultural productivity for reaching food security (SDG 2) can also reduce pressures on forests.
The interlinkage between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and forests relates to water availability and water quality."

The QSP – a funding mechanism under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) – concluded its operations in December 2019.

In 2006, the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) established the QSP to help countries produce and use chemicals in ways that minimize adverse impacts on the environment and human health through projects in a range of sectors, including agriculture, environment, health, industry and labor. The Programme reports that its project helped raise awareness and build institutional capacity for the sound management of chemicals at the national level, as well as advance mainstreaming and multi-sectoral approaches.

During its tenure, the Programme enabled the implementation of 184 projects in 108 countries, including 54 least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). It mobilized a total of USD 47.9 million through its Trust Fund.

QSP projects addressed: chemicals accident preparedness and poison centers; implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions and the Minamata Convention on Mercury; collection and systems for sharing, including pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS); pesticides and agriculture; national chemicals profiles; and mainstreaming development plans and processes.

Among its country-specific initiatives, in Sri Lanka the QSP helped national experts, academics and 600 employees from the rubber, textile and tourism industries manage chemicals through training manuals, sector guidelines and an online course. The project titled ‘Empowering Sri Lanka’s vital industries to manage chemicals the SMART way‘ strengthened the capacity of institutions and universities and enhanced efficiency and environmental performance of local industries.

In Lesotho, the QSP helped improve food security through the proper use of herbicides and pesticides, including through training sessions on safe use for more than 200 farmers, district staff, traders, environment officers and machinery operators, among others.

Other projects addressed:

Protecting human health and the environment from mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Cambodia and the Philippines;

Strengthening national capacities for the sound management of priority carcinogenic chemicals in Bhutan;

Building capacities and raising awareness on integrated non-chemical control of mosquitoes in Albania;

Capacity building for strengthening the management of heavy metals in Barbados;

Strengthening capacities in Burkina Faso for national SAICM implementation and the promotion of synergies among the BRS Conventions; and

Developing an integrated national programme for the sound management of chemicals and supporting capacity building on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) in Benin.

SAICM is a global multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder, voluntary policy framework aimed at minimizing significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. A new overarching approach for SAICM and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020 is currently under negotiation through an intersessional process that is expected to conclude at ICCM5.

The series will make the case for why the nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy; identify a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation; and scope the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges.

Titled ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ the first report presents four chapters discussing the nature emergency, the risks of nature loss to businesses, how to manage these risks, and how to take action. The publication’s appendix offers an approach to modelling nature dependency for countries and sectors.

In their foreword, Dominic Waughray, Managing Director, Managing Board, World Economic Forum and Celine Herweijer, Global Leader, Innovation and Sustainability, PwC, United Kingdom, note that “every industry sector has some degree of direct and indirect dependency on nature” and identify nature loss as a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.” They point out that pursuing a “nature-positive way of doing business” can mitigate future economic and societal shocks.

Nature loss is a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.”

The report goes on to discuss how risks to nature manifest as risks to business across all sectors. They highlight the report’s findings, which indicate “that $44 trillion of economic value generation – more than half of the world’s total GDP – is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and is therefore exposed to nature loss.”

The report follows on the heels of the WEF’s Global Risks Report, which for the first-time in the report’s 10-year history listed the top five risks in terms of likelihood as environmental.

The NNE series, which is produced in collaboration with PwC, is being developed under the umbrella of the WEF’s Nature Action Agenda, a platform for mobilization and support in the lead up to the UN Biodiversity Conference in October 2020, at which time a new global biodiversity framework is expected to be adopted.

The Barcelona Convention COP 21 took place from 2-5 December 2019, at the Castel dell’Ovo in Naples, Italy. Over 200 participants from the 22 Contracting Parties as well as representatives from UN agencies, international research organizations, multilateral development banks, the private sector, and civil society attended the four-day event.

Through the Naples Ministerial Declaration, Parties also committed to develop trans-disciplinary research and inter-sectoral policies to address climate change through a cross-cutting approach, particularly with regard to the water-food-energy nexus.

Aside of the Ministerial Declaration, some of the thematic decisions adopted at COP 21 included:

the common regional framework for integrated coastal zone management;

Mediterranean offshore guidelines and standards;

updated guidelines regulating the placement of artificial reefs at sea;

governance;

identification and conservation of sites of particular ecological interest in the Mediterranean; and

a road map for the possible designation of the Mediterranean Sea area as an emission control area for sulphur oxides pursuant to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, annex VI, within the framework of the Barcelona Convention.

During a ministerial session, Joyce Msuya, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), remarked that a recently concluded study found that there are about 62 million individual pieces of marine litter floating in the Mediterranean Sea, adding that progress on improving the marine environment in the Mediterranean region can serve as a powerful driving force towards achieving the SDGs.

In a video message, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, echoed the need to address the “plastic plague,” explaining that plastic has permeated the food chain to the point where we are “eating the consequences.” Gaetano Leone, UNEP, noted that the Barcelona Convention must be central to the events taking place during 2020, as the “super year” for the global development and biodiversity agendas.

In a High-Level Panel Discussion on Protecting the Marine Environment and Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, Gavin Edwards, Global Coordinator, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), called out the challenge of moving MPAs from ‘paper parks’ to areas of enforcement. He reiterated that 2020 will be a “super year” of opportunity for the planet given the second UN Ocean Conference and the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, adding that many sectors, including business and finance, are increasingly taking biodiversity and climate protection “more seriously.”

During the high-level discussion, delegates further highlighted the need to, inter alia: not scare people about the current climate situation but instead instill optimism; not underestimate the climate challenge; and to scale up efforts and restore science and evidence-based policies to increase confidence.

Speakers at the event, which took place on the first day of the Minamata COP in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 November 2019, highlighted that the biodiversity and chemicals and waste-related MEAs cut across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address a number of interlinkages. Given that there are ongoing processes to develop both a post-2020 framework for the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and a post-2020 global biodiversity framework, speakers highlighted that there are opportunities to enhance policy coherence and cooperation for both processes.

Moderator Jacqueline Alvarez, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Chemicals, introduced the event.

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UNEP, highlighted that 2020 will bring, among other activities, the delivery of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, key events addressing global policy for biodiversity, chemicals management and oceans, and the IUCN World Conservation Congress. She highlighted the importance of recognizing interlinkages among all of the 2020 activities, and illustrated the possibilities for thinking about synergies in terms of operational and programmatic linkages such as combining customs training related to mercury and international trade in endangered species.

Rossana Silva Repetto, Executive Secretary, Minamata Convention on Mercury, noted that there are cases in which mercury issues negatively interlink with other topics, such as when waste is not properly managed or released into water bodies and the ocean. She suggested that a way forward could include: working at the national level through intersectoral processes, with the 2030 Agenda providing a framework for such coordination; highlighting specific pollutants and adding related targets to the post-2020 biodiversity goals; strengthening national action plans for the Minamata Convention that also support biodiversity plans; and addressing illegal trade in environmentally sensitive commodities. She also said the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) is a platform for collaboration, and suggested stronger MEA participation in UNEA preparations, during UNEA and in implementing relevant UNEA resolutions.

Martha Rojas Urrego, Executive Secretary, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, emphasized that the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services indicates pollution is one of five drivers of biodiversity loss, which has implications for mercury management. She said areas in which collaboration could take place include plastics, water and water-related ecosystems, and land pollution. She noted that wetlands are filters, citing one area in which biodiversity can contribute to the solution. She suggested adopting common indicators for the biodiversity and chemicals conventions as a way to promote collaboration.

Felix Wertli, Head of Section, Global Affairs, Federal Office for the Environment, Switzerland, said shared indicators can help facilitate discussions among government departments and ministries.

Carlos Martin-Novella, Deputy Executive Secretary, Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions, encouraged giving attention to the structure of the interlinkages among the post-2020 Aichi targets and post-2020 chemicals agendas.

The event was organized by the UNEP with the objective of showcasing the interlinkages between clusters and facilitating and interactive dialogue on way forward. Participants were informed that the Chemicals and Waste Branch of UNEP in consultation with Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals (IOMC), among others, is drafting an Assessment paper that seeks to assess the linkages between chemicals and waste management and other international policy agendas and to identify opportunities for coordination and cooperation.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the publication, Armenia’s experience shows that the two building blocks of identity – CVRS and identity management – do not need to operate under one agency to be done successfully, but can work well even if different agencies are responsible, as long as the respective systems are interoperable so they can share information.

The case study highlights how the country’s Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for civil registration, and the Police have developed “a solid framework” for working together. The publication notes that Armenia’s modern CRVS is fully digitized, with all registered information being entered directly into the electronic civil register. This system enables the digital vital events records that belong to a specific person to be linked, so their up-to-date identity information is available any time. The identity management system is managed by the police, its population register being an electronic database that serves as the main tool to manage identity data and issue national ID cards and travel documents.

The country study also reports that each time a new birth is added to the civil register, the information that includes identity attributes of the newborn is automatically sent to the population register, where a new personal record is created. Also, every time a new vital event is registered and the names of informants are added to the civil register, this digitized platform automatically pulls identity information for the informants from the population register. This way, the publication explains, the two interoperable systems can provide up-to-date information to other users of identity data from these registers.

Some of the good practices identified in the Armenia case study include:

Digitizing civil registration processes to enable easier data sharing and registration of vital events;

Including an e-health platform that can be accessed at hospitals, where digital and paper-based medical certificates are produced;

Linking the civil and population registers electronically to the civil register to copy identity data of informants or applicants from the population register, instead of copying that data from an identification credential that a person presents; and

Using an innovative platform to verify if civil registration certificates and documents are authentic.

The publication highlights data interoperability among government-operated information and communications technology systems as essential to the effectiveness of the holistic approach taken with regards to the CRVS and identity management systems, as it allows the government to decide which types of data each service can access. The text explains that when a nation-wide layer of data interoperability was added, specific procedures were instituted to regulate cooperation between the two agencies.

Overall, Armenia’s framework to fully digitize government services by 2030 focuses on cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, government efficiency, tech-oriented private sector, and tech-savvy workforce. According to the framework, once the proposed E-Gov is fully in place, it will reduce the cost of government services by 50%, significantly reduce corruption and increase competitiveness, and add up to 3% to the growth rate of Armenia’s gross domestic product.

According to the case study, like most countries that emerged from the former Soviet Union, Armenia inherited a well-developed system for registering vital events, thus investment was needed for the system’s digitization, which was done with support from the EU. The total amount invested in digitizing so far is estimated at around USD 2 million, with the digitizing of historical records being estimated at USD 1 for each vital event record.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

In a significant improvement over the inaugural version, 68 indicators have been directly borrowed from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework (NIF) while another 20 are modified versions of NIF indicators and 12 have been developed by NITI Aayog in consultation with Union ministries. This alignment of indicators will pave the way for better coordination among government agencies for tracking India’s performance on SDGs.

Another noteworthy improvement is the broader coverage of goals, targets and indicators. While in the first edition, Goals 12, 13 and 14 were not included, only Goal 17 has been left out of the second round for ranking sub-national governments due to the absence of any relevant indicators in the NIF. Additionally, while SDGII 2018 covered 39 targets and 62 indicators, SDGII 2019 spans 54 targets and 100 indicators.

Scores improve

So, how are we faring in our quest for achieving the SDGs? Overall, India’s score has improved from 57 to 60, with notable progress on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9 and 11. While, a decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio has contributed to our improved performance in the area of ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, ramping up toilet coverage under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan has raised the country’s score on ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’.

The commendable performance on Goal 7 is due to expanded access to clean cooking fuel and the government’s massive electrification drive. Similarly, on Goal 9, the progress can be attributed largely to a significant improvement in rural road connectivity and increased mobile phone penetration. Our performance on Goal 11 has been boosted by better access to housing through the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana as well as more widespread adoption of door-to-door waste collection and processing.

While this progress is heartening, there are certain indicators where focussed attention is required. For instance, India’s tuberculosis notification rate is still high, thus limiting our overall progress on Goal 3. Further, there are some SDGs on which the whole country needs to step up its performance considerably, namely those pertaining to poverty, hunger, gender and climate action.

Limitations exist

While SDGII 2019 is a much-improved version, an exercise of this nature is not without its limitations, especially because of the gaps in data availability. In subsequent versions of the Index continued efforts need to be made to include indicators that capture the full extent of the SDGs. For instance, if the target is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, we need to go beyond measuring spousal violence and sexual crimes against children. Similarly, SDG 3 must capture at least one indicator that reflects the country’s progress on tackling non-communicable diseases.

Crucially, concerted efforts need to be made to generate data disaggregated by gender, age and socio-economic status to truly get a sense of how we are faring in terms of fulfilling the overarching SDG mantra of ‘leaving no one behind’.

Finally, future SDG Index reports could perhaps go a step further by including good practices that enable high-performing States/UTs to make progress on each of the goals, thus providing useful lessons for those lagging behind.

India is the only country to publicly rank its sub-national governments on SDGs. While the exercise needs strengthening in terms of scope and quality on an ongoing basis, it is a valuable effort that needs to be persisted with as it helps to bring the SDG agenda into the limelight at the national level as well facilitates its localisation at the level of States and UTs.

Are you willing to accept this challenge too?

Originally published in the ESI Africa final newsletter for 2019 on 15/01/2020

In the industry, we are familiar with the UNDP’s Sustainable Development Goal 7 – access to affordable and clean energy – which has a fast-approaching ‘sell-by date’ stamp of 2030.

For those of you willing to join me in my new year’s resolution, here are some basic items to help you along the way.

Inform your networks about SDG 7. You will be surprised about who isn’t aware of the goal.

Spread news stories with your community, for instance, at your child’s school, or on your neighbourhood social media pages.

Write in-depth articles about goal 7 to keep it in the news and newsworthy.

According to the UNDP, between 2000 and 2016, the number of people with electricity increased from 78% to 87%. Globally, the number of people without electricity dipped to just below one billion.

This progress is fantastic but all things considered, it’s a drop in the ocean. The challenge for the SDGs, and precisely goal 7, is the sheer number of people they relate to, making it near impossible to fully accomplish as populations continue to grow.

The goals require, nay – demand, vast amounts of funding and investment. On the ground, SDG 7 can make headway where finance is made available for solar, wind, hydro, and clean thermal power projects.

Join discussions on project bankability at the African Utility Week and POWERGEN Africa conference. Click here to register to attend or for more information about the event.

However, advancing clean energy generation capacity is futile if those it serves to connect to a power supply can’t afford the tariff. The solution lies in thinking about supply and demand outside the box – a cliché that is quite fitting.

Power supply and demand fits into a tight co-dependent box. Where the supply is reliable and affordable, the demand remains high.

It’s a dynamic that is evident in South Africa’s current chaotic energy environment where loadshedding is contributing to economic decline and therefore also demand for electricity – a story to unpack another day.

As an example of out of the box financing for SDG 7, consider a farming community that needs to pump water. Could the farmers form a co-op and use their produce as ‘money’ to pay for the power? Imagine a power purchase agreement (PPA) quoted in bushels of corn.

Granted, this type of PPA could not work for utility-scale power projects; however, to get traction on SDG 7 we need substantially more small-scale, localised and decentralised clean power projects. There are many such projects doing their bit to power rural and off-grid communities but don’t make it to headline news.

Do you know of small-scale projects that are perfect examples of achieving this UNDP goal? Be sure to include them in your new year’s resolution and give them a hearty shout out!

Till next week,

Nicolette","On 1 January 2020, I welcomed in the New Year with one resolution: To keep SDG 7 at the heart of all I aim to achieve this year.
On the ground, SDG 7 can make headway where finance is made available for solar, wind, hydro, and clean thermal power projects.
However, advancing clean energy generation capacity is futile if those it serves to connect to a power supply can’t afford the tariff.
Power supply and demand fits into a tight co-dependent box.
Granted, this type of PPA could not work for utility-scale power projects; however, to get traction on SDG 7 we need substantially more small-scale, localised and decentralised clean power projects."

India’s standing vis-a-vis United Nations-mandated goals has improved marginally, but the country has slipped in key areas, related to food security, livelihood and standard of living.

The country’s overall score of 60, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Index 2019-20 released by NITI Aayog, was three points above its 2018 standing. This was primarily due to better performance related to water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy as well as industry, innovation and infrastructure.

But the country was worse off in several goals (SDGs):

SDG 1 – Alleviating poverty

SDG 2 – Ending hunger

SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth

SDG 10 – Reducing inequality

SDG 15 – Preserving life on land

SDG 16 – Upholding peace, justice and strong institutions

A hungry nation

India’s worst performance was towards SDG 2: Ending hunger by 2030, where its score has fallen to 38 in the current year from 48 in the previous year.

This was also highlighted by Global Hunger Index 2019 released in October 2019, which places India 102nd among 117 qualifying countries.

As many as 25 states and Union territories failed to address “hunger and malnutrition”, according to the NITI Ayog index. Jharkhand led from the bottom, scoring 22 off 100, followed by Madhya Pradesh (24) and Bihar (26).

Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh were among the states that lagged.

Top performer Goa scored 76, a dip of four points. Scores also dipped for five of the top 10 states: Manipur, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre-backed think tank considered three new indictors:

Children (6-59 months) who are anaemic

Children (0-4 years) who are underweight

Gross value added in agriculture per worker

Those apart, there were four existing indicators:

Rural households under public distribution system

Stunted children (under five)

Pregnant women (15-49 years) who are anaemic

Rice, wheat and coarse cereals produced annually per unit area

Climate challenge

The index recognised climate change as a challenge to ensuring food security in India as it turned food production highly vulnerable.

It stressed on climate-smart sustainable agriculture and called for widening climate-adaptive farming practices, new technology and plans that involve land owned by small farmers, who constitute more than 82 per cent of India’s farmers.

Poverty, gender parity

India slipped four points to 50 vis-a-vis ending poverty, with 22 states unable to reduce poverty. The situation was dismal for gender parity too.

Goa ranked last there, with its score plummeting 31 points to 19.

The index, in its second year, ranked the states and UTs based on 100 indicators for 54 targets across 16 goals.

The case study on Namibia is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the case study, Namibia has a fully integrated civil registration and identity management system that registers, processes, and updates the identity information of citizens, permanent residents, and refugees – the National Population Registration System (NPRS). The NPRS was created by combining various databases that held different types of personal information linked by a unique identification number (UIN).

The publication notes that, even though Namibia still faces challenges in ensuring that marriage and divorce registrations are complete, major progress was made when birth and death registration became a key prerequisite for offering social grants. This tactic allowed Namibian authorities to incentivize the demand side of the registration process.

The authors highlight that adopting information and communication technology (ICT) was essential to building the NPRS, as it helped integrate and launch electronic birth and death notification platforms. The case study underscores that, if adopted correctly and applied to redesigned business processes, ICT can deliver an overarching and interoperable population register that serves an effective tool for delivering high-impact services for governance and public administration. The publication cautions that legal frameworks and technological advancements must be kept in sync as much as possible, despite the fast pace of technology innovations.

In Namibia, births and deaths are registered using notifications from the innovative e-birth and e-death notification platforms, which are linked to the NPRS and hosted at health facilities, police mortuaries and civil registration offices. The publication explains that the NPRS is the main building block of the interoperability framework as it uses the National Data Exchange Service Bus interoperability data layer, which allows it to link the population register with functional registers that the government and the private sector run, making it easier to share data and verify identity data.

By digitizing civil registration business processes and setting up a database architecture that connects different databases, the Namibian government ensured that they all use the same identity data stored in the civil register, enabling fraud prevention long associated with the financial benefits that people get when registering vital events.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Netherlands and Peru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

24,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-s-top-films-of-2019-sry8eg5a,"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG’s Top Films of 2019,"Religious themes graced an unusual number of notable films in 2019, which our critic says may be the best movie year of the decade — with one notable caveat.

An exquisite art-house film about a beatified martyr. The triumphant arrival of a belated documentary of a celebrated gospel concert. A fact-based drama about an alliance of devout and unbelieving survivors of clerical sex abuse calling for justice.

These are just a few of an unusually large crop of notable films that tackled religious and spiritual themes in 2019.

Prayer, clerical characters, and church services and liturgical celebrations featured in several films, from the baptism and confession scenes in Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman to Tom Hanks’ Mr. Rogers praying for all the members of the Vogel family by name in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.

There was a revisionist Jesus indie. A Harriet Tubman biopic that treated Tubman’s faith and mystical experiences as a kind of superpower. A documentary about an influential priest who served on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and marched with Martin Luther King Jr.

There were also, of course, a number of faith-based films, produced within the “Christian film” industry. Among these were the fact-based medical-miracle drama Breakthrough, the sports movie Overcomer and the abortion-themed conversion story Unplanned, based on Abby Johnson’s memoir.

All of these were embraced by the faithful and did well at the box office, though like most faith-based films they continued the trend of preaching to the choir.

The revered filmmaker Terrence Malick is a Christian and the religious themes in his work are very deliberate, but his films speak powerfully to cinephiles of other faiths and of none. His latest celebrates the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter, a devout Austrian Catholic executed in 1943 for refusing to swear the soldier’s oath of allegiance to Hitler, and declared a martyr and beatified in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI.

A somewhat different case: In cataloguing the horrors of China’s crimes against humanity, the critically acclaimed documentary One Child Nation bears startling witness to the human dignity of discarded fetuses found in alleys and garbage dumps, above all in the work of the visual artist Peng Wang, the film’s most eloquent voice of conscience.

I found this the most powerfully pro-life message on American screens in 2019, though the filmmakers didn’t set out to make a statement about abortion itself. On the contrary, late in the film is a glib throwaway line unconvincingly comparing efforts to restrict abortion in the U.S. with China’s policies of forced abortions and sterilizations.

Still, the film’s unavoidable pro-life implications have caused discomfort, perhaps even cognitive dissonance, among some of its supporters. At Sundance a leading New York film critic, while acknowledging the film’s achievements, expressed concern about how the U.S. “extreme right” might respond to it — an indication, for me, of the film’s moral power.

In some cases, on the other hand, religious themes were downplayed or omitted entirely where they might be expected. For example, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, though a delightful film and a fascinating commentary on Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel, omits essentially every scrap of the source material’s religiosity while adding a shocking line about God’s will in relation to an impending tragedy.

A Beautiful Day includes Mr. Rogers’ faith and prayer but omits the larger role of prayer in the source material. Tolkien could hardly help including the youthful Tolkien’s clerical guardian, but it subverts his relationship with Tolkien and otherwise ignores the role of Catholicism in Tolkien’s life, including its direct relationship to his mother’s ostracism from her family.

2019 was another banner year for Disney dominance. With the combined power of its Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm brands, the Mouse released seven of the year’s top 10 box-office hits domestically, including Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. (That’s not counting Spider-Man: Far From Home, which Disney got a piece of but was released by Sony. Rounding out the top 10 were Warner Bros’ Joker and It Chapter Two.)

None of these branded IP releases were among my favorite films of the year, but that wasn’t very surprising or disappointing.

More disappointing was the dearth of high-quality family films. Original content especially was lacking amid a parade of sequels (Lego Movie 2, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World) and remakes (The Lion King, Aladdin, Dumbo).

Movies often come in twos, but this year there were a trio (!) of abominable-snowman cartoons — none very good. What else? Among the odds and ends, the most diverting were a hand-drawn Santa Claus origin story (see my honorable mentions) and a live-action Arthurian fantasy adventure called The Kid Who Would Be King from Attack the Block director Joe Cornish. (Toy Story 4 also was good, not great.)

In a way it was a year for trios. In a great year for nonfiction films, a trio of archival “time machine” documentaries that brought the past to startling new life were all so miraculous that ranking them was practically meaningless. (In the end, lacking anything else to go by, my deciding factors were subject matter and emotions: I would rather think about space travel than war, and I would rather think about God than anything.)

Among the year’s popular high-profile releases a trio of auteur-driven throwbacks to classic Hollywood genres with a twist — the whodunit, the “women’s picture” and the gangster movie — had me cheering.

But I was disappointed by the trio I had been most looking forward to: three acclaimed original films — The Lighthouse, The Nightingale and Us — each the sophomore effort of a director whose wildly original horror feature debut (respectively, The Witch, The Babadook and Get Out) set a high bar.

Among other acclaimed films I wasn’t over the moon for, I was dazzled by the brilliant filmmaking of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, but after reading scads of raves I remain unsold on the ending. And I was crushed not to love Clemency, a movie that, on paper, ought to have been a shoo-in for my top five, or even my top three.

Still, going just by the quality of the films in my top 10 (and the difficulty I had eliminating many worthy runners-up that I would have been just as happy including in the top 10), I might call 2019 the best overall movie year of the 2010s — with the caveat that family audiences were underserved.

When I first saw the harrowing Syrian documentary The Cave I was sure it would be in my top 10, until it was displaced by For Sama. How is it possible that For Sama didn’t make the top 10 either? How did Aquarella, from the Russian documentarian whose quietly delightful ¡Vivan Las Antipodas! rounded out my 2013 top 10, land in my honorable mentions? Perhaps most astonishingly to me, why is Marriage Story not in my top five, let alone my top 10?

That’s how good the films were this year.

At any rate, this is my list of the 30 films that most moved, thrilled, inspired, shook or haunted me in 2019. If your favorites aren’t listed below, it’s not because I “forgot” them, although, as always, there are many films I have yet to catch up with and others I wish I had enjoyed more than I did.

SDG’s Top Films of 2019

A Hidden Life. The moral themes of dramas of martyrdom and conscience like A Man for All Seasons and Sophie Scholl blend with Terrence Malick’s signature themes of theodicy and paradise lost in this ecstatic, anguished three-hour cinematic hymn singing the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter. Malick’s most linear film in years is also his most overtly religious and most political, with challenges for both believing and secular admirers. Violence and menace; thematic content. Mature teens.

One Child Nation. The psychological and cultural toll as well as the human-rights atrocities of China’s war on the family are laid bare in Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang’s daring first-person stealth documentary. Juxtaposing Wang’s memories of growing up in the one-child era with revealing interviews and archival materials, it’s a furiously controlled blend of political indictment, cultural cross-examination and personal journey. Frank discussion of atrocities, including forced abortions; some disturbing images; brief language. Mature teens.

Amazing Grace. Sydney Pollack’s long-unfinished film of Aretha Franklin’s 1972 gospel concert with the Southern California Community Choir at L.A.’s New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, completed at last by producer Alan Elliott, is at once an exuberant celebration of music and showmanship and also a transcendent act of worship. Nothing problematic.

The Farewell. A gorgeous and winning cross-cultural comedy-drama about an extended Chinese family going to unusual lengths to gather around a dying matriarch who doesn’t know she’s dying, Lulu Wang’s semi-autobiographical film finds universal truths in the tale of a very specific lie. A Shinto ritual; brief crass language; heavy drinking and inebriation; mature themes. Teens and up.

Light from Light. Loss, mystery and the pursuit of meaning are recurring themes in Paul Harrill’s subdued indie dramas set in East Tennessee. His latest, starring Marin Ireland and Jim Gaffigan, is a whisper-quiet ghost story that, while not overtly religious, implicitly raises questions about discerning the voice of God speaking to us. Mature themes; a brief medical scare. Teens and up.

Apollo 11. Long-neglected high-definition NASA film reels and brilliant editing offer genuinely new, wondrous access to one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements in Todd Douglas Miller’s masterful documentary. Brief language. Kids and up.

They Shall Not Grow Old. Voices and faces from the dim and distant past emerge with stunning vitality in Peter Jackson’s tour de force World War I documentary, which features cutting-edge digital restoration and colorization of archival footage. Graphic battlefield imagery. Adults.

Little Women. It’s still a feel-good celebration of family bonds and moral virtue, but Greta Gerwig hasn’t just remade Louisa May Alcott’s often-adapted classic — she’s reimagined and reinterpreted it, interweaving the two halves of Alcott’s story and glossing the autobiographical significance of Saoirse Ronan’s Jo March. Brief inebriation; mature themes. Might be fine for older kids.

Knives Out. In Rian Johnson’s hands, an old-fashioned, ridiculously entertaining whodunit with all the usual elements becomes a morality tale with a distinctly contemporary vibe, rewarding decency and compassion, siding with the marginal over the privileged, and knocking the complacent on both sides of contemporary political discourse. Murder theme; a suicide; sexual references; frequent profanity and crude language. Teens and up.

By the Grace of God. Three adult survivors of clerical sexual abuse in childhood band together to confront Church authorities and face their trauma in François Ozon’s emotionally persuasive fact-based French drama. Several graphic descriptions of clerical sex abuse of boys; references to a genital deformity; brief partial female nudity; brief domestic violence; some harsh language. Adults.

In a ranking of states released last week by Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog and the United Nations, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially in poverty alleviation and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh sank to the bottom of the list.According to the SDG India Index 2019, India’s composite score improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20 with successes in water and sanitation, power and industry. Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.Kerala retained the top slot while Bihar came out as the worst performer. Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100, where it fully achieves its SDGs. Himachal Pradesh ranked next with 69 due its clean water and sanitation efforts, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among the union territories (UTs), Chandigarh topped at 68 due to its focus on clean water and sanitation and providing quality education.Tamil Nadu also topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.As per the SDG India Index 2019, the composite score for each state/UT is computed by aggregating their performance across the goals, and then by taking the arithmetic mean of individual goal scores. A score of 100 implies that the State/ UT has achieved targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that the particular State/UT is at the bottom of the table. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim have shown maximum improvement, as per the report for second year released by NITI Aayog on Monday. This first such report was released in 2018.The year 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by 193 countries at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The Index has been developed by NITI Aayog in coordination with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute.In 2018 index, only three states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, were placed in the category of front runners – with a score in the range of 65-99. In 2019, five more States joined this league – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Sikkim and Goa, taking the total tally to eight.With regard to poverty reduction, states which have done well include Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim. On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. It is designed to function as a tool for focused policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, and moving towards development action pegged to globally recognizable metrics. The Index also supplements NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts to encourage evidence-based policymaking by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and sharing best practices.The 2019 Index is more robust than the first edition on account of wider coverage of goals, targets, and indicators. It spans 16 out of 17 SDGs with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels. Further, the Index highlights the need for improvements in data collection, reporting and methodology. Partnerships for disaggregating data and developing capacity for real-time monitoring and measuring incremental progress are also being explored.","Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its rapid improvements in health facilities, gender equality and quality education.
Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015.
Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education.
On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia.
This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels."

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

Article content Poverty is the most-persistent social ill in all of human history, and anyone who tries to solve it has always faced an uphill battle. Nonetheless, the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being Plan created for Cornwall, Akwesasne, and the United Counties of SDG has made poverty reduction one of its four main pillars. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Working to eradicate poverty in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Back to video Each pillar contains several proposed initiatives that could be implemented across the entire region. The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation. More On This Topic More people, better access to health care in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Working to create safer communities in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Cornwall, Akwesasne and SDG endorse community safety and well-being plan Vibrant Communities publishes community well-being plan for SDG For this poverty pillar, the newspaper went over all the ideas with Juliette Labossiere, the executive director of the United Way / Centraide of SD&G, which already supports a wide range of initiatives dedicated to breaking the cycle of poverty.

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content Advocacy The plan starts off by proposing the region begin a campaign advocating for several changes that have been championed by anti-poverty activists in recent years. These include either free or affordable tuition and access to nutritious food; a more generous social assistance that allows recipients to begin to build up savings; and, for local employers to begin paying a living wage. Labossiere said the United Ways in Perth and Huron are currently leaders on the living-wage issue. Not only do those organizations pay their employees living wages, they highlight businesses in their communities who do the same. “It’s like: they are a gold business because they pay their employees a living wage. It’s a community rating system for businesses, if you will. It’s been quite influential, and it is something that could be moved over,” she said. Adult education Education and retraining are often put forward as ways to break the cycle of poverty by giving people more options in their lives. The plan says a culture of volunteerism should be promoted as a way to help people build their qualifications while helping the community. It also proposes more interactive and accessible education to meet people’s needs and diverse learning styles, as well as an educational resource list. Expanding literacy training and employment preparedness courses is another proposal, which are things already being done by the Tri-County Literacy Council. Labossiere said the United Way already supports the council with its grants, but one easy way to improve adult education in the region would be for more people and charities to do the same.

Article content Programs for the working poor This initiative proposes working with existing agencies and people with lived experience to find gaps in the support system for people just barely getting by and then coming up with collaborative solutions. One of the biggest problems Labossiere sees is how the current system punishes poor families who start making more money “We are fortunate to live in a community that has fantastic accessibility levels for families with low revenues. There is low or free access to child care and summer camps, but then there’s that red line that if you make more than this amount, you no longer qualify,” she said. “Many families are still in the working poor category when they are just above that line. “So how can we break down barriers to participation for families in that grey area?” Prevention initiatives Preventing poverty can be easier than getting people out of its insidious cycle, so the community well-being plan proposes more prevention initiatives be created, targeted specifically at children and youth. These include life skills workshops to teach things such as food preparation, laundry, sex education, good consumer practices, financial literacy, and budgeting. It also proposes creating homework help and breakfast programs as well as mentorship programs. Labossiere noted there is already a program being run by the French Catholic school board called L’Equipe Psycho-social that does many of these things for vulnerable students and could be used as a model.

Article content Housing issues Homelessness is another tricky issue to try to solve, but the plan proposes advocating for more supportive housing in the region for people with mental illnesses, disabilities, and other health needs. It also calls for ensuring that there is adequate social housing for low-income families and individuals. A sense of community “Isolation is a huge factor in breaking the cycle of poverty, it’s even a determinant of health. We have to see isolation that must be worked on,” said Labossiere. “Anything that gets people feeling like part of a community makes for a healthier community, and a healthier community is one where people are less reliant on services and more reliant on neighbours.” Ways to cut down on that feeling isolation include organizing block parties or affordable recreational activities, such as sports or summer camps. Realities of poverty Being poor has always come with a large stigma attached, but the plan aims to change that. Great strides have been made in reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the past several years, and by holding workshops, particularly with employers, the plan hopes to do something similar. “I think there’s a misconception on the part of people who have lived a privileged life about those who have to struggle,” said Labossiere. “What do you do when your rent is due, you need electricity, and your kids are always hungry? “If you are always in survival mode, how do you take time to stop to do financial planning or make a good investment? You don’t.’

Article content Expanding access In order to give people easier access to the services that are already available, the community well-being plan calls for looking at the implementation of more online and phone services, as well as working with providers on things such as flexible hours and transportation programs. Volunteer opportunities Local community organizations are always in need of volunteers, and the community well-being plan wants to see a culture of volunteerism take hold in the region. Labossiere said work on this is already underway with the creation of the new volunteer managers association and the revamping of the Volunteer Hub website, which will have postings for volunteerism opportunities in the region. Better co-ordination The plan calls for organizations to work more closely together to help as many people as efficiently as possible. This includes creating a community hub where several different services can be accessed under one roof. “It’s not about giving money to one agency, it’s about addressing one need and bringing as many people to the table as necessary to fix it,” she said. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/Alan_S_Hale

28,https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/opp-mobile-crisis-response-team-included-in-sdg-budget-after-all,"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Standard Freeholder,OPP mobile crisis response team included in SDG budget after all,"Mere minutes into his presentation, Blanchette presented an option that had not been discussed in prior meetings — the crisis response team could in fact lead to reduced calls for service, which in turn would lead to reduced costs in the police budget.

“We live here, we work here, we raise our families here, we want what’s best for our community,” he told council members. “In our last visit, we explained the program. There were some questions I understand, that were raised after our presentation. So I just wanted to address a couple of points.”

OPP Const. Jim Blanchette was back before council to provide clarifications regarding the proposed partnership between the SDG OPP and the Mental Health Crisis Team (MHCT) at the Cornwall Community Hospital.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Although council had initially expressed support for the partnership, most members had also outlined they didn’t want SDG to finance the project on a yearly basis, citing that doing so should be the provincial government’s mandate.

The future of the proposed OPP mobile crisis response team was cemented during an SDG council meeting Monday.

In order to solidify his point, Blanchard pointed to a specific case in Winchester, where, two years ago prior to an intervention from the OPP and community partners, a woman had been involved in 128 calls for service.

“Since we’ve had the intervention, we’ve only had one interaction with her,” said Blanchette. “I could go on and on and on about the benefits shown across the province with this type of community team response. I think it’s important to note that this proposal is actually an extension to the police services board.

“You have an opportunity to reduce your police services budget in a reduction of calls for service.”

Despite Blanchard’s claims, some elected officials were still skeptical of who would end up having to finance the request.

“My fear is that if we fund this this year, will you be coming back every year,” said Coun. Bryan McGillis. “It adds up to a lot after 10 years. Are you going to be back next year with the same amount?”

“It certainly not our intention to make this request every year,” answered Blanchette. “If this program gets off the ground, then we won’t need to come back.”

Coun. Tony Fraser, on the other hand, expressed how he felt SDG was often overlooked by the provincial government.

“I don’t doubt the cost saving or the benefit this could have for our community,” said Fraser. “My struggle is not a struggle with this project. My struggle is with the province. Sometimes I feel that as members of the SDG council, we’re neglected and it is a struggle to find the funds that we need to keep everything working.”

A supporter of the proposal since its initial pitch, Coun. Kirsten Gardner urged her fellow council members to support the initiative.

“We’re going to invest $100,000 in a newspaper digitization project,” she said. “History doesn’t save lives.”

The $120,000 was added to the 2020 budget. SDG council will return to budget deliberations in February.

Article content This article has been edited to correct the spelling and job title for Cornwall Community Hospital’s vice-president of community programs Christine Penney. Out of the four pillars that make up the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being plan, mental health was given top billing in recognition of its importance in building a healthy and safe community. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Improving mental health for a safer & happier Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Back to video There has been a dramatic shift in thinking about mental health issues over the past several years. There is much more awareness and acceptance that seeking help is normal, where once people feared they would be labelled as crazy. With that normalization, there has been a big push to increase and improve mental health services, a trend the new community well-being plan wants to capitalize on. The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation.

Article content More On This Topic Working to eradicate poverty in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne More people, better access to health care in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Working to create safer communities in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Cornwall, Akwesasne and SDG endorse community safety and well-being plan One of the most prominent mental health organizations in the region is the Cornwall Community Hospital, which not only operates its own mental health Services department, but also several community programs. Hospital CEO Jeanette Despatie noted much of what is proposed in the community safety and well-being plan is being implemented by different groups across the region, but these efforts cannot keep up with the demand for mental health services. “There is a need for additional resources to meet the demand. For instance, there is a real need for more psychiatrists, but we know the need to recruit more is not going away any time soon. So it is our responsibility to figure out different ways that we can help deliver services to fill those needs,” said Despatie. Training and education This has been the goal of mental health advocates for many years, and there has been an enormous amount of success in achieving it. But the plan calls for initiatives such as programs for mental health in the farming community, helping communities become dementia friendly, and workshops to help people identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Christine Penney, the hospital’s vice-president of community programs, pointed out the Canadian Mental Health Association is currently doing this in schools.

Article content “We also work with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit around prevention and education, while our mandate is providing treatment,” said Penny. Free counselling The community safety and well-being plan calls for more counselling services that do not cost to the individual. But Despatie argued it would be good to try to expand counselling services, even if they are not completely free, in order to deal with the problem of wait times. “I know the plan is focusing on the free services, but expanding the offerings through our programs would be great, because right now the demand is greatly outstripping the capacity to meet people’s needs in a timely fashion,” she said. Increase availability and access The plan proposes this could be done in several ways, such as having more evening hours so people can seek help after work or school, mobile services for rural communities, and the use of technology for telemedicine. Many of these initiatives already exist in some form or another, organizations including the hospital offer mobile services , and more and more clinics are expanding their evening hours. “There’s always room for increasing evening hours, but it still comes back to the need for more resouces,” said Penney. Penney also noted the hospital is about to embark on a new pilot project using the Zoom teleconferencing platform, which they believe will be particularly popular with youth and rural residents who need to speak with a counsellor.

Article content More support groups There are plenty of support groups for mental health issues such as alcohol and substance abuse, but the community safety and well-being plan wants to see more aimed at problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, postpartum depression, and youth. It also advocates for mentorship programs and programs to teach coping skills. Fortunately, a new post-partum depression clinic has just opened in Cornwall at the Cotton Mills, under the guidance of a local doctor. “They’re just about to get their first group going,” said Penney. Support for caregivers People who take care of their loved ones with mental illnesses are often the unsung heroes of the health-care system. But taking care of someone 24-7 is exhausting, and the plan calls for more support to help make thing easier. Just a few months ago, the hospital opened its new caregiver centre at its facility. “We have peer support from other caregivers, and we put a special emphasis on addiction and mental health because we know those caregivers have a specific set of stressors. So the idea is you can come in between noon and 4 p.m. and talk to someone who will give you emotional support, there is also plenty of resources on things like navigating the system,” said Penney. Prevention and intervention The focus of these programs would be to help people learn life skills, stress management and healthy childhood development. For instance, the plan calls for the creation of wellness groups to help people develop hobbies, self-worth and confidence. It also proposes workshops to teach healthy habits such as cooking exercise, gardening, work/life balance, and so on.

Article content One existing program that might serve as a model is the infant mental health program the hospital has been collaborating on. “A lot times people say ‘infant mental health? What the heck are you talking about?’ What you are actually doing is working with the family, the mother in particular,” explained Penney. “When you identify a high-risk situation – mom may have an addiction or the attachment is occurring as you might expect – we immediately work with our pediatrics unit, the health unit, and children’s aid to put together a comprehensive program for those moms-at-risk.” A community hub One idea that is promoted in all four pillars of the plan is a proposal for a single location where a wide range of social and medical services could be accessed under one roof. In the mental health care space, the hospital’s mental health Services department already fits the bill. But there is also a youth hub located on Pitt Street, which offers recreation for teens as well as access to employment services, a nurse practioner, addiction and mental health treatment. Enhance awareness

Another suggestion contained within the other three pillars is to take steps to make knowing what services are available and how to find them easier. When it comes to mental illness treatment, the hospital has both a phone line to call, as well as two employees who serve as system navigators – one for adults and one for youth. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/alan_s_hale

This comes as a result of the negative consequences it has on people, specifically, women and girls.

Her view is that unlimited access to safe water and sanitation are undoubtedly human rights for people everywhere across the globe, especially for women and girls, as recognized in 2010 by the United Nations General Assembly.

For these rights, society will need the right systems: well-resourced, capable institutions delivering services and changing behavior in resilient and appropriate ways. As it stands, over 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services while an estimated 4.2 billion still lack safely managed sanitation services.

Unsafe hygiene practices are seen everywhere on a daily basis, degenerating the negative impacts on people’s health, especially those in deprived communities. The effect on child mortality rates is so dire with more than 297,000 children below the age of five dying every year as a result of diarrheal diseases, a consequence of poor sanitation, poor hygiene, or unsafe water

In the absence of a facility that safely separates human waste from human contact, people are rendered with no other alternative than to use unsafe public latrines or resort to open defecation. This is often a headache to women and girls, as they have to wait until the cover of darkness before going out to locate a place of convenience, a phenomenon which sometimes leaves them to be abused and sexually assaulted.

In the immediate environment, lack of an improved sanitation facility will only expose fecal matter back into people’s food and water resources, thus leading to the spread of deadly diseases such as cholera.

In some parts of the world, there is little or no awareness of good hygiene practices and their role in reducing the spread of diseases. However, it is often the case that even when people do have knowledge of good hygiene behavior, they lack the soap, safe water, and washing facilities they need to make a positive change to protect themselves and their community. Indeed, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene will help drive progress towards the SDGs concerned with poverty, work, and economic growth, also it will help achieve gender equity.

It is women and girls who bear the burden of collecting water and caring for relatives who are sick due to lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and who often miss out on education due to domestic roles assigned them. Lack of WASH worsens the marginalization of females by locking them into a cycle of poverty and struggles, with wider consequences for society.

The impact of universal access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) on global health would be wide and varied as women and girls would have the facilities and knowledge to be able to manage their menstrual cycles in safety and dignity.

There is also the potential to save the lives of the over 829,000 people who currently die every year from diseases caused by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices, and we could also drastically reduce child malnourishment, and help eradicate physical and mental under-development.","This comes as a result of the negative consequences it has on people, specifically, women and girls.

The Sustainable Development goals data are based on 17 broad goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 2015.

India’s SDG Index is based on Qualitative Assessment which considers measuring the progress in all the States and Union Territories of India.

The SDG India Index was made in association with the United Nations of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and the Global Green Growth Institute. The UN-SDG Index is a part of the United Nations Resolution to be achieved by 2030.

However, the reports released by NITI Aayog seem to be inefficient and inaccurate as per the UN Index. So it will itself be a question of progress when the report itself inefficient. Let’s see how the report is inefficient and what is lacking behind the scenes.

Why India’s SDG Report 2019-20 Is Not So ‘Standardised’ As Per The UN Index

The SDG India Reports do not consider at all the Index as set by the United Nations for Indexing the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations has developed and finalized 232 Indicators for measuring SDGs which comes under the 17 broad goals as set by the UN. All the member nations should use 232 indicators for fair treatment and indexing. However, NITI Aayog only used 100 of these, which are 40% of the indicators in total.

Though the NITI Aayog’s vision has been modified and customised according to their own purposes, the standard monitoring approach should not be ignored especially when are treating and preparing nation wise data. The current report doesn’t seem to in line with the UN Indicators as all factors are not considered in the SDGs.

That’s why India’s SDG Index seems to be unstandardised and inefficient both. The concept and reports both are incomplete because there is reduction in indicators. Therefore, considering only 100 indicators instead of the proposed 232 indicators is inappropriate as well as misleading.

What Could NITI Aayog Have Done To Make The SDGs More Appropriate?

The Centre-driven organisation could have considered the whole indicators which making Sustainable Development Goals Report. This could have given a more specific detailed report on all the parameters.

On the other hand, these reports can be used to measure the country’s state and UT performances on these scales. In this way, the country will become able to take the right steps to achieve the goals as announced by the United Nations in the 2015 General Assembly.

The Current Reports Of India’s SDG Index

According to India’s SDG Index for 2019-20, Kerala stood top among the countries whereas Bihar, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh are in the bottom list. While seeing the data, Himachal Pradesh stood at 69 whereas Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh achieved 67 out of 100 in the recent SDG Index.

Here’s a report:

Conclusion

The current reports and analysis may not be counted as an appropriate one as it does not take into consideration the standards as set by the UN. It doesn’t matter if the indicators are worth or not, but ignoring and cutting short them can lead to inefficient reports.

The reports should have been prepared on the basis of total indicators as set up by the UN to maintain uniformity and check the country’s status on all ground indicators.

Well, we have all that is needed here, to be every bit as glamorous and successful as PEC.” Clement went on to outline what she believed is a solid foundation to develop agri-tourism in the region. “We have competent cities and towns,” she said. “We have an experienced agricultural sector here. We have local entrepreneurs that are fierce and creative. This is a perfect recipe for agri-tourism.” The mayor concluded by promoting the city’s tourism development fund. The said fund exists in order to support entrepreneurs wanting to create an event, festival, project or even collaboration that would attract tourism to Cornwall. “The province has allowed us to set up a fund by collecting revenues through tourists that come here,” Clement said. “This sits in a fund and people apply to that fund. We want to make sure that the people understand that that fund is to support anything that is going to bring tourism to Cornwall, that result will nights stays and accommodations. “If it’s going to somehow benefit the City of Cornwall, then we want to hear about it.” Akwesasne’s District Chief Edward Roundpoint praised for his part the partnerships created between the region’s neighbouring communities.

It’s about bringing us all together. We will build on each other. Co-operation is the best thing that we can offer.” The mood in the Upper Canada Cider Company was best echoed by how Clement concluded her speech.

34,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/oecd-introduces-checklist-for-sub-national-action-on-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,OECD Introduces Checklist for Sub-National Action on SDG Implementation,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released a synthesis report and a localized indicator framework to help cities and regions improve their SDG strategies, plans and implementation. The report argues that, beyond the compliance agenda, cities and regions should leverage the full potential of SDGs as a policy tool to improve people’s lives in a shared responsibility across levels of government.

The experiences of nine pilot cities and regions show the SDGs’ potential to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

Released during the Tenth World Urban Forum (WUF), on 10 February 2020, the report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs: Synthesis Report,’ highlights the key role of subnational governments in achieving the SDGs and demonstrates the importance of the SDGs for cities and regions. The report argues that many OECD countries are increasingly seizing the potential of the SDGs as a framework to improve multi-level governance, and in particular vertical coordination. For instance, Germany and Japan are promoting the “localisation” of the SDGs from the central government level by supporting cities and regions in their local SDGs strategies, both financially and in terms of capacity building. The report also documents – from the experience and evidence of nine pilot cities and regions – the potential that the SDGs offer to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

The report introduces a ‘Checklist for Public Action’ to help policymakers implement a territorial approach to the SDGs. The checklist presents action-oriented recommendations across five categories: planning, policies and strategies; multi-level governance; financing and budgeting; data and information; and engagement.

On planning, policies, and strategies, the checklist recommends defining and shaping local and regional development visions, strategies and plans and reorienting existing ones using the SDGs as a guiding framework; using the SDGs to manage tradeoffs and promote synergies among sectoral policies and across levels of government and link social, economic and environmental dimensions at the Goal or target level; using the SDGs to address concrete local challenges that require holistic approaches, such as access to green spaces, territorial inequalities or service delivery; and identifying place-based priorities through a participatory, multi-stakeholder process that considers the indivisibility and interconnectedness of the SDGs.

On engagement, the checklist suggests: using the SDGs as a vehicle to enhance accountability and transparency through engaging all territorial stakeholders in the policymaking process, including co-designing and co-implementing visions and strategies in a bottom-up, participatory way; engaging stakeholders using a combination of tools, such as providing networking opportunities, de-risking investments in SDG solutions through grants or loans; and using the SDGs as a tool for “public service motivation” by linking staff’s daily work with SDG achievement. Selected examples illustrate how cities and regions have implemented these recommendations.

The OECD Localised Indicator Framework for the SDGs measures the distance towards the SDGs for 601 regions and 649 cities, using 135 indicators across the 17 SDGs. At least 80% of regions from OECD countries have not achieved the suggested end values for 2030 in any of the 17 Goals. The average distance of OECD regions to the SDGs in 2030 ranges from 25% to 60%, showing that cities and regions in OECD countries are “far from achieving the SDGs.” Cities and regions are lagging behind the most on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action), and are performing the best on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Cities and regions can use the tool to compare their performance with other cities and regions in their country and identify peers in other countries. The tool aims to promote peer-learning and policy dialogues across cities and regions, increase government accountability on the SDGs, and raise awareness on the SDGs among society as a whole. An overview of Tataouine, Tunisia, for example shows that the city is 50% of the way towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), below the OECD average of 69%, and 48% percent of the way towards reaching SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), below the OECD average of 73%. The tool identifies Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand as a comparable city or region. The tool identifies Kinki, Japan, and Oslo and Akershus, Norway, as peer regions for New York, US.

OECD’s Programme on a Territorial Approach to the SDGs produced the report and indicator framework. The Programme plans to publish nine additional pilot-specific reports. Each report will offer in-depth analysis, tailored policy recommendations and action plans to champion a territorial approach to the SDGs.

OECD will launch a second phase of the Programme, which will work to implement recommendations and to support new cities, regions and countries in their efforts to localize the SDGs.

Voluntary national reviews (VNRs) are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

China, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Marshall Islands and Slovakia have signed up to conduct and present VNRs in 2021. It will be the Marshall Islands’ first time presenting a VNR, while the other countries have each presented a VNR previously.

China and Germany were among the first countries to present a VNR, during the 2016 HLPF. China later announced a national action plan and targets for each of the 17 SDGs. Germany’s report highlighted: taking all aspects of the SDGs into account and accounting for impact of actions beyond national borders; and strategies to reduce Germany’s ecological footprint, including national strategies for biodiversity and sustainable consumption.

Czech Republic reported in 2017, saying its VNR process had involved stakeholders to ensure factual accuracy and wider acceptance. In 2018, Slovakia highlighted the need to: anchor the SDGs in all public policies; engage in partnerships at all levels, from the regional to the municipal; align budgets with 2030 Agenda priorities; and encourage voluntary actions.

The 2021 VNRs will be the first to take place following the UN General Assembly’s review of the format and organization of the HLPF, which will address the VNRs alongside other elements.

The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

37,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/sdg-5-going-girl-power-1865209,"Sun, 09 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Daily Star,SDG 5: Going for Girl Power,"An episode in UNICEF Bangla-desh’s popular cartoon Meena, the protagonist’s cousin Rita, a 15-year-old girl receives a proposal to marry the village shopkeeper’s son. The shopkeeper’s intention is to have his son married to a girl who would be meek and gentle and would do all the household chores. But the young girl is not ready for marriage at such an early age and wants to complete her education first. She has learned, moreover, that early marriages result in complicated pregnancies and even death. So, with the help of her cousin Meena, Rita musters up the courage to tell her father that she is not ready to get married; and fortunately for her, the suitor too had told his father that he will not marry a minor girl and as a result, the marriage is postponed.

Despite being a fictional character, Meena was an ambassador of social and cultural change, particularly on issues pertinent to gender. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, embodies the spirit of Meena’s advocacy. SDG target 5.3 calls upon countries to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage. Unfortunately, forced early marriage is still widespread in Bangladesh—although there has been a declining trend. The percentage of women in Bangladesh between ages 20 to 24 years old who were first married by the age of 18 years old decreased from 73.3 percent in 1994 to 58.6 percent in 2014. Similarly, the percentage of women between ages 20 to 24 years old who were first married by the age of 15 years old decreased from 47.2 percent in 1994 to 22.4 percent in 2014. Despite the improvement, these numbers are nonetheless unacceptably high. When women are married off at such early ages, it substantially compromises their ability to pursue their education and participate in the labour market.

Apart from early marriage, empowerment of women in Bangladesh has also been stifled through violence. SDG target 5.2 asserts the need to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres. However, in 2015, as high as 55 percent of women who were ever-married and 65 percent of women who were currently married reported suffering from violence inflicted by their partners, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Regrettably, a large number of incidents of violence against women remained unreported. In 2015, an estimated 72.7 percent of ever-married women in Bangladesh did not disclose their experiences of violence to anyone. This means that the prevalence of violence against women may be far worse than illustrated by the findings of the official surveys. In fact, according to Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), a legal aid and human rights organisation, 409 women were victims of domestic violence, 116 women were victims of sexual harassment,195 women were victims of physical torture for dowry and 22 women were victims of acid attack in 2018.

Gender inequality is a pervasive phenomenon which has proliferated from households to markets to governance systems and to all other spheres of society. This means that the myriad miseries of life, such as poverty, physical violence, sexual abuse, illiteracy, unemployment, employment with low wages, landlessness, vulnerability to climate change and burden of unpaid household work—all tend to affect women disproportionately more than men. Thus, it is imperative to identify the root causes of gender inequality, and consequently make the relevant changes in laws, institutions and policies that will create equal opportunities for men and women.

Concurrently, the economic empowerment of women through education and employment must be ensured. The right to education should not be violated on the basis of gender, and girls at all ages should be guaranteed access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities within secure and supportive environments. The unpaid household work of women should be eased by improving access to clean drinking water and natural gas for cooking. In order to support working women, legislation on equal pay and maternity benefits should be properly enforced, and child care centres should be established. Ultimately, the success of these measures will depend on whether the overall attitudes, values and perceptions towards women are consistent with, and conducive towards, the goal of achieving gender equality. Unless the required behavioural changes can be achieved, it will be difficult to accomplish SDG 5 by 2030.

On 6 January 2020, the UNGA President announced the appointment of the Permanent Representative of Qatar, Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, and the Permanent Representative of Sweden, Anna-Karin Eneström, as co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations on the declaration to be adopted at the commemoration event, which will convene on 21 September 2020.

In a letter of 7 February 2020, the co-facilitators wrote to UN Member States to announce the first informal consultations on the document. They suggest discussion of five possible elements:

Acknowledging achievements: What are the UN’s main contributions to its three pillars of work – development, human rights, and peace and security?

Looking ahead: What measures are needed over the next 25 years to strengthen multilateralism and reinvigorate global governance?

Responding to major global challenges: What are today’s most fundamental global challenges? How is the UN standing up to new challenges?

Delivering on commitments: How can the UN better deliver on its purposes and principles?

Building consensus and mobilizing for change: How can the Decade of Action advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind? How can the UN maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors? How can the UN strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth?

The first informal consultation will convene on 21 February 2020 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting will be open to Member States and permanent observers.

The UNGA has agreed that negotiations on the declaration will conclude by June 2020, and the declaration is to be adopted by consensus. [Letter from co-facilitators]","UN Member States are beginning negotiations on a declaration for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

The XIV Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Santiago, Chile from 27-31 January 2020, ahead of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), and its Beijing Platform for Action. This year’s CSW session will conduct a review of progress towards the action platform.

The Regional Conference served to review progress towards the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, adopted in 2016 at the XIII Regional Conference, and identify barriers to progress.

Without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.

During the Conference, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) launched a regional progress report that identifies hurdles to achieving gender equality in the region. The Regional Progress Report on the Montevideo Strategy, the first of its kind, recognizes successes towards achieving gender equality in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region to date. It also finds that as LAC governments prepare for Beijing+25, challenges include 1) the sheer magnitude of gender inequalities in the region and the limited State capacities available to address the issue; 2) lack of disaggregated data to analyze the issue; 3) the fact that gender inequalities manifest themselves at international, regional, national and subnational levels, and coordination is needed to renew and implement public policy across governance levels; and 4) the need to increase the budgets allotted to gender equality policies.

The Conference concluded with countries’ approval of the Santiago Commitment. The Commitment’s 48 points outline the means by which countries will accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. It welcomes the Regional Progress Report and reaffirms the commitments made in Beijing in 1995. The Commitment encourages countries to foster and promote public polices on various dimensions of gender equality including education, representation, labor participation, to measure the multiplier effects of boosting the care economy and strengthen the production of gender statistics at the national level, and to voluntarily report on progress.

At the Regional Conference’s closing session, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said it is time to “put an end to patriarchy as a societal model.” Isabel Plá, Chile’s Minister of Women’s Affairs and Gender Equity, emphasized that “without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.” The next session of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean is planned to be held in Argentina, in 2022.

Other regions have also affirmed commitments ahead of Beijing+25. UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab Regions committed to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at meetings organized in November 2019 by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), which resulted in respective declarations on progress.

In Europe, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) held a review meeting from 29-30 October 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland, co-hosted with the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia. In Africa, a regional review took place from 27 October to 1 November 2019, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UN Women and the African Union Commission (AUC).

In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) informed governments that a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.

Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:

Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

It also reports on a set of “common internationalized resource identifiers” for the SDGs and their targets and indicators.

The report of the Secretary-General titled, ‘Work for the review of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,’ was submitted ahead of the UN Statistical Commission’s 51st session in March 2020.

On the federated information system for the SDGs, the report notes that it was launched in March 2017 as a research exercise on strengthening the ability of the national and global statistical systems to manage and share knowledge, information and good practices on data and statistics for the SDGs. Following its 2017 endorsement at the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management (GGIM), the system has been providing access to national data shared by participating countries, as well as geospatially-enabled statistical data on SDG indicators.

Most recently, the UN Statistics Division and technology partners have worked to scale up the federated system initiative to include new countries and build capacity at the national level. The federated system is also being used to support the UN Development Coordination Office in displaying country data and visualizing country progress towards the SDGs. This could include online country profiles to visualize geospatially-enabled statistical data from the Global SDG Indicators Database.

The report invites the Statistical Commission to express its views on the scaling-up of the federated information system of national and global data hubs.

All UN organizations and stakeholders have been urged to tag their SDG-related resources according to the common identifiers.

The Secretary-General also reports on the common internationalized resource identifiers for Goals, targets, indicators and related statistical series. The identifiers were developed by the High-level Committee on Management of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), the UN Statistics Division and the UN Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM). They are now hosted by the UN’s Dag Hammarskjöld Library.

The common identifiers are intended to help create a “homogeneously classified information space” and allow for automatic retrieval, processing and integration of information related to the Goals on the semantic web. In November 2019, the Secretary-General presented the common identifiers to the CEB, inviting all UN organizations to adopt the identifiers by signing the related statement of adoption. To date, the statement has been signed by eight organizations.

A pilot application was developed by the UN Statistics Division and the Division for the SDGs (both part of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, DESA), with EU support. The application, currently in “demo form,” automatically extracts key concepts related to sustainable development from text documents and links them to the most relevant SDGs, targets, indicators and series. In other words, it finds semantic links between text, statistical data, and SDG entities.”

The report invites the Statistical Commission to take note of the identifiers and express its views on their potential use for the dissemination of statistical data sets in linked-open-data formats.

The report also provides an update on the Data for Now initiative, launched in September 2019 and jointly led by the UN Statistics Division, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, the World Bank and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Data for Now works to build capacity in countries to utilize new data sources.

A technical workshop took place in November 2019, in Kigali, Rwanda, resulting in country-specific road maps for data related to education, human mobility, poverty and land use. The partnerships initiated during the workshop are expected to be “consolidated and expanded over the next year,” with results to be showcased at the UN World Data Forum in October 2020, according to the Secretary-General’s report.

The report invites the Statistical Commission to endorse the Data for Now initiative.

The Commission will hold its 51st session from 3-6 March 2020. The session also will consider 36 proposed “major changes” to the SDG indicator framework, resulting from the 2020 Comprehensive Review of the indicators conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UN event to mark the Day focused on linkages between inclusive quality education, lifelong learning and SDG implementation, with speakers calling for multilateral action to ensure everyone has access to quality education.

The UN General Assembly’s high-level dialogue convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 24 January 2020, on the theme, ‘Aligning Inclusive Quality Education Policies with SDGs.’ The meeting recognized numerous challenges facing education and achievement of SDG 4 (quality education), including 258 million children and young people out of school, and 60% of children and adolescents unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in literacy and mathematics. Participants observed that refugees, migrants and people with disabilities face additional challenges in accessing education. Participants also expressed concern about education quality, observing that education and training are not preparing students for the future world of work.

UNESCO has called on all governments to integrate education for climate action in national education policy and planning.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande outlined education challenges in his address, including a decline in education quality and standards, a widening knowledge gap between students in technically advanced countries and students in developing countries, and a crisis of learning in conflict zones. He called for today’s education to “bridge the yawning gap” between learning opportunities and modern employment needs for specialized skills, noting that school curricula need to anticipate and respond to workplace needs. Despite these challenges, Muhammad-Bande highlighted forward-looking education policies in some countries that are contributing to achieving SDG 4 targets. He urged Member States and other partners to consider establishing education networks to exchange information and ideas.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said, “education has the power to shape the world.” She recognized the power of education to empower women and give them opportunities to make choices. She said quality education can help change perceptions and behavior, including on unsustainable practices and climate change, and can promote mutual understanding and respect, helping to combat misperceptions, prejudice and violent extremism. She stressed that education is critical to achieve the SDGs, and called for stepping up efforts and building partnerships to ensure quality education becomes a reality. She called for transforming the way the world thinks of education, including to ensure education tackles hate speech and facilitates an inclusive digital transformation. Mohammed said education should also include ecological issues, noting that the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has called on all governments to integrate education for climate action in national education policy and planning.

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay warned that there is a global learning crisis, which she said is also a crisis for prosperity, the planet, peace and people. She emphasized “education is the best investment for the future” and highlighted UNESCO’s role in making education “an instrument of inclusion and…of empowerment.” Azoulay called on everyone to take action for education.

UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Mona Juul highlighted the role of education in escaping poverty and transforming communities. She said education paves the way towards productive, sustainable and resilient societies in which everyone can reach their full potential.

43,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/suriname-norway-submit-2020-ndcs/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Suriname, Norway Submit 2020 NDCs","Suriname and Norway have submitted their 2020 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The two countries follow Marshall Islands, which in 2018 became the first country to submit its second NDC.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change establishes five-year cycles to increase ambition, including through NDCs that would grow more ambitious over time. Countries requested that in 2020, Parties with an NDC time frame up to 2025 communicate new NDCs, and Parties with a time frame up to 2030 communicate or update their NDCs by 2020.

Suriname submitted its second NDC on 9 December 2019. As low-lying coastal country and, like Marshall Islands, a small island developing State (SIDS), Suriname and its population face vulnerability as economic activities are concentrated in the coastal zone. Therefore, Suriname’s NDC includes adaptation elements, including its 2019 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as part of its climate strategy.

Among its conditional and unconditional mitigation contributions, Suriname’s NDC presents a package of policies and measures with sectoral sub-targets, including enhanced contributions from four of the country’s six emitting sectors: forests, electricity, agriculture, and transport, which together cover an estimated 70% of emissions.

In its NDC submission, Suriname emphasizes its efforts to protect its natural resource and forests serving the global community as a biodiversity hotspot and a carbon sink. As a high forest cover and low deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname commits to maintaining 93% forest cover.

Forty-one countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

Taking into account Suriname’s domestic circumstances and capabilities, the maintenance of the carbon stock and the sectoral emission reductions are undertaken on the basis of equity, conditional on the availability of finance, and in the context of sustainable development, according to the NDC document.

Norway submitted its updated NDC on 7 February 2020, with a target to achieve economy-wide emission reductions of “at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels” for the time frame 2021-2030. The target covers all sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs). This is an ambition enhancement from the country’s original NDC, in which Norway intended a 40% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Norway seeks to fulfill the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

In the event Norway’s enhanced NDC should go beyond the target set in the EU’s updated NDC, Norway intends to use voluntary cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 to fulfill the part that goes beyond what is fulfilled through the climate cooperation with the EU. Norway notes that the EU’s current climate framework “does not open for the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs) from outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA), emphasizing that final accounting towards its NDC target may depend on any further arrangements in Norway’s cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

Norway further informs that it will have specific legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering emissions from all sectors and all GHGs. About half of Norwegian GHG emissions are covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which regulates emissions from industrial plants, power plants, the petroleum industry, and commercial aviation within the EEA. Not covered by the EU ETS are emissions from industry, petroleum, and the transport, agriculture, buildings, and waste management sectors. These are regulated under the Effort Sharing Regulations, which set binding national targets. Norway’s national target is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS-sectors by 40% in 2030 compared to 2005. The target can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by the use of flexible mechanisms within the EU framework. With regard to the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation, Norway’s commitment is to ensure that emissions do not exceed removals in this sector.

Norway considers the NDC “fair and ambitious” as it is in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 and onwards that correspond to keeping global warming in line with the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2°C,” and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, above preindustrial levels. Norway references the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Panel’s special report revealing pathways towards limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

Since the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in 2016, a number of world leaders, including during the 2019 UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, said they would submit new or updated NDCs by the first quarter of 2020. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), with partners, issued a supporting guidance for this process of developing new or updated NDCs, which it generally treats as “NDC enhancement.” According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 2020 NDC tracker, 41 countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

Each year starts with the possibility of a new beginning, but often still carries the baggage of the previous year. As 2020 begins, the international community faces deadlines to replace old frameworks and rules with new ones, and to conclude negotiations on new treaties and agreements.

It is timely to take stock of global environmental governance as the world enters a new year and a new decade. In our new report, ‘The State of Global Environmental Governance 2019,’ the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team reflects on the successes, shortcomings and overall trends of 2019. We also look ahead, with optimism 2020 will regain the momentum recently lost.

In 2019, scientists were truth-tellers. Over the course of the year, international scientific bodies produced a range of reports on climate change, biodiversity, and the environment as a whole. Each report contains dire warnings for the future of the planet due to the impact of climate change on food production, of pollution on human health, and land incursions on species extinctions. Given historic inaction, nearly every system on the planet is in danger.

Yet, despite the thousands of pages of scientific evidence, intergovernmental political processes remain deadlocked on so many issues. Policy makers could not mount the type of response commensurate with the science.

Climate change governance had a particularly difficult year, limping to the end of the decade after the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The demands for climate ambition are loud, and angry. Millions of children and youth, feeling their futures have been stolen, participated in climate strikes every Friday throughout the year. Hearing their calls, 67 countries pledged greater climate ambition at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September, but these countries represent only a small fraction of global emissions. As the year came to a close, governments at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP 25) failed to issue a clear call for ambition and could not agree on rules for the market mechanism necessary to complete the Paris Agreement rulebook. The Paris Agreement officially begins in 2020 amid major questions about its ability to catalyze climate ambition and prevent global warming above 2°C.

There were a few bright spots during the year as some policymakers acted on the scientific truths. The first multilateral action to reduce global plastic waste, which amounts to millions of tons each year, was taken under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Certain Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In May, parties to the Basel Convention agreed to include mixed, unrecyclable, and contaminated plastic waste exports into the control regime that requires the consent of importing countries before waste exports can proceed. The fourth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly sent a strong signal that production and consumption of single-use plastics should be reduced or phased out, and the plastics industry has been put on notice. In fact, over the course of the year more than 30 countries around the world, nearly half of which are in Africa, put in place bans on single-use plastic bags.

As we outline in a chapter on linkages, 2019 was also notable for increasing recognition of the need for a more interconnected form of governance. More and more, actors drew linkages among environmental and sustainable development processes, especially biodiversity and climate change, land and climate change, oceans and climate change, human health and the environment, and economics, trade and climate change. The increased understanding about the impacts of degrading ecosystems and a warming climate on local and global economies alike, has led to a number of multinational companies and financial institutions announcing new climate-friendly policies and investments.

Of course, the links among the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are many and complementary. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report was released in time for the SDG Summit in September. The report outlined progress in some critical areas, including declines in extreme poverty and the under-5 mortality rate, increases in access to electricity, and greater efforts to respond to urbanization, waste, and illegal fishing. Nonetheless, many areas need urgent collective attention, including climate change, ocean acidification, land degradation, hunger, education and gender equality. The report also stressed that the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is jeopardized as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts, and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

It is abundantly clear the world needs an urgent, ambitious response to unleash a social and economic transformation. But, in 2019, world leaders appeared detached from the crisis at hand, reading statements that were largely devoid of meaningful pledges. This reaction was in stark contrast to the verdict of the people who rose in protest during the Summit and throughout the year: leaders are failing to address the environmental and development emergency the world faces.

This year, we face a busy international agenda as well as waning political will, rising nationalism, and faltering support for multilateralism. 2020 is expected to conclude negotiations and establish new tools to address biodiversity, marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and a post-2020 strategic approach to international chemicals management. We are already in the fifth year of SDG implementation, and to succeed by their 2030 completion date, governments still need to increase their ambition under the Paris Agreement.

Positive, forward-looking outcomes are essential, but not guaranteed.

Mohammed is providing a series of briefings as well as written updates ahead of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities for Development segment (OAS), which will convene in May 2020.

In the briefing at UN Headquarters on 29 January 2020, Mohammed said the regions have been “the ‘forgotten level,’ largely left untouched in previous reform efforts.” But regional assets are critical to achieve the 2030 Agenda because of the cross-border nature of today’s greatest challenges, including climate, trade, health and conflict, she said.

Mohammed reported on progress that has “significantly raised the bar” for the regional level, including:

Establishing inter-agency teams in each region, with a focus on “unpacking the five broad transformative areas” outlined in the Secretary-General’s 2019 report to ECOSOC;

Detailing the architecture of proposed regional collaboration platforms (RCPs);

Establishing a knowledge hub in each region, with the Arab region’s ‘Manara’ being the most advanced; and

Enhancing transparency at the regional level.

Mohammed said that beginning in 2021, ECOSOC will receive aggregated information on regional collaboration, a type of reporting that “does not currently exist and addresses a major gap in accountability.”

On data and statistics, regional ‘SDG Gateways’ are being established for pooling SDG data for consistent analysis and action. The first SDG Gateways will launch in March 2020 in three regions: Arab States, the Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

In late February 2020, discussions will begin with each region on their specific initiatives. The review will be finalized by late March, she said, and she will discuss work plans and transitions in her visits to each region during its upcoming SDG Forum (Regional Forum for Sustainable Development).

On the MCO review, Mohammed explained that these are offices that cover mostly small islands, which to date have had limited attention to each country’s specificities. After visiting 15 countries in 2019, the Secretariat presented recommendations for improving the UN development system’s support in MCO settings. Subsequently, an inter-agency working group and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) facilitated more specific consultations on putting each proposal into practice.

Mohammed said UN development system entities have made specific commitments including increased financing, data systems, physical presences, technical capacities, and policy advice. In addition, coordination capacities have been provided with greater resources. As a result of this process, seven countries that are serviced by the Caribbean MCO but do not have an office in country will now have a coordination office; and a road map has been created to establish a North Pacific office.

She said OHRLLS continues to hold dialogues with all countries concerned to address remaining questions on substance and process. Resident Coordinators are ensuring that “national counterparts are fully in the loop” and “there will be no implementation before the ECOSOC has the opportunity to consider all proposals” at the OAS session.

The OAS will convene from 19-21 May 2020, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The segment will review four years of implementation of the UNGA guidance contained in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of UN system operational activities for development (QCPR), as well as progress in the repositioning of the UN development system as mandated in UNGA resolution 72/279.

The UNGA will conduct its next QCPR in late 2020. The UN Secretary-General’s report to the ECOSOC operational activities segment is also the main Secretariat input to the UNGA for its QCPR deliberations. ECOSOC’s webpage on the QCPR notes that the 2020 QCPR is “expected to build on the outcomes of the 2019 SDG Summit, thus placing an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.” In addition, it notes that the UNGA will discuss the QCPR “on the heels” of the high-level event commemorating the UN’s 75th anniversary, which could position it to “give new impetus and high-level political guidance to the UN development system repositioning and its efforts to work in an effective and impactful way across peace, development, humanitarian affairs and human rights.” [UN Deputy Secretary-General’s remarks] [ECOSOC website on OAS]","UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed informed UN Member States of steps taken to strengthen the UN development system’s regional level, and its multi-country offices (MCOs) in the Caribbean and Pacific, among other updates.

The report also provides evidence for links between WASH and another 14 conditions, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that are not yet quantified.

The report serves as an update and builds on the WHO’s previous analysis of environmental disease burdens and interventions. The agency’s (2016) findings showed that, globally, “1.9 million deaths and 123 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) could have been prevented with adequate WASH. The WASH-attributable disease burden amounted to 3.3% of global deaths and 4.6% of global DALYs.” Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest disease burden from inadequate WASH.

The publication highlights the relationship between improper disposal of excreta, lack of hand washing facilities, and pathogens in drinking water on the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections. It describes how standing and wastewater are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which serve as additional disease vectors.

For the following diseases – diarrhoeal diseases; respiratory infections; soil-transmitted helminthiasis; malaria; trachoma; schistosomiasis; lymphatic filariasis; onchocerciasis; dengue; Japanese encephalitis; protein-energy malnutrition; drowning; arsenicosis ; fluorosis ; legionellosis; leptospirosis; hepatitis A and hepatitis E; methaemoglobinaemia; cyanobacterial toxins; lead poisoning; scabies; spinal injury; poliomyelitis; and adverse neonatal conditions and maternal outcomes – the report gives a detailed account of links to inadequate WASH. Where possible, it also describes interventions and gives economic evaluations.

The report draws particular attention to the impacts of inadequate WASH on young children, noting that, “among children under 5 years, WASH-attributable deaths represent 13% of deaths and 12% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs),” an outcome that could be prevented with existing prevention strategies and interventions. These interventions would include implementation of: water safety planning; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe recreational water environments; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater; and sanitation safety planning to prevent exposure to excreta along the sanitation chain.

The anniversary will be commemorated with a high-level event at UN headquarters in New York, US, on 21 September 2020.

The co-facilitators for the consultations are Anne-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, and Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar. Addressing delegations at the start of the meeting on 21 February 2020, Eneström noted divergent views on some of the topics to be addressed, and said the co-facilitators will “hold the pen” in drafting the resolution, using input from delegations. Al-Thani said the co-facilitators will speak with all interested parties and stakeholders.

This organization has enough documents; it is time to deliver on our commitments.

On the tone and function of the document, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the resolution must resonate with citizens around the world. Eneström said the declaration should: be written in the voice of the heads of state and government that will assemble in September; contain a focused political message; be understandable and inspire action from all stakeholders; speak to youth and others while also being phrased “at a high level,” and give a sense of achievement while inspiring accelerated action.

Governments then offered their views. A few suggested including sections on the UN’s three pillars – development, peace and security, and human rights – as well as references to strengthening, reforming and modernizing the UN. Many said the declaration should reinforce urgency and commitment related to the 2030 Agenda and the Decade of Action. The discussion indicated broad support for reaffirming the principles of multilateralism and the value of a rules-based international system founded on the UN Charter and international law. The “functional nature” of multilateral cooperation should be highlighted, said one government, in order to address the many issues that transcend national borders.

Member States responded to the food-for-thought paper provided by the co-facilitators before the meeting, which suggested that the declaration address five areas: acknowledging achievements; looking ahead; responding to major global challenges; delivering on commitments; and building consensus and mobilizing for change.

On acknowledging achievements, one delegation said the paradigm of the UN has been changed to put the 2030 Agenda at the heart of its work. Governments also highlighted that the UN has: contributed to a strong body of international law, which should be universalized; provided a common covenant on preserving the rights of future generations; prevented further world wars; improved living standards; and achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

On looking ahead, delegations called for genuine reflection on strengthening global governance and multilateralism, for aligning the UN’s intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and for transforming the UN’s values into people’s lived experiences. One government said a better balance must be reached between the peace and security dimension and the development dimension of the UN’s work, noting that all available energy and resources seem to be activated for peace and security issues, but when it comes to development, “everything is just voluntary.”

Some delegations highlighted the importance of the sovereign equality of states, with one saying that “in reality, not all States are created equal, but large or small, all have an equal right to be heard here at the UN, and all have rights and obligations.” Others emphasized the communications role of the UN, noting the need for “a UN that listens to people and can communicate more clearly.” One highlighted the SDGs as a communications asset.

On responding to global challenges, some echoed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ assessment of challenges and threats set out in January 2020. He had identified as “four horsemen” that endanger progress: geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology. Building on these ideas, governments said the world needs a stronger UN than ever before, and highlighted: non-traditional security threats; inequalities within countries; artificial intelligence; xenophobia, hate speech, and migrant rights violations; climate change and pollution, the importance of a successful UNFCCC COP 26 to address the “increasingly existential” threat of the climate and environment crisis, and the need for the UN to mobilize means to address both mitigation and adaptation;

On ways for the UN to better deliver on its purposes and principles, one delegate said that “turning 75 usually means retirement,” but for the UN it must be a time of rejuvenation and reform. Speakers stressed that the UN must modernize in order to not lose confidence of people, and it must adapt to the challenges of the 21st century to remain the primary forum for multilateral cooperation.

Governments highlighted the need for reforms to the UNGA, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN’s peacebuilding architecture. They emphasized in particular the need for the Security Council to become more representative, but also for reforms to limit the use of the veto, such as in situations of mass atrocities.

Delivering on specific commitments and frameworks from the UN was also a priority for many speakers, with one saying that “this organization has enough documents”; the most important priority now is to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlighted the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.”

On building consensus and mobilizing for change, the co-facilitators had asked for input on how the Decade of Action can advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind, as well as how the UN can maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors, and how it can strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth? Many highlighted the importance of engaging women, girls and all youth, with one noting that events in 2020 make it a particularly important year for women and girls. One delegation said developing countries need funding, especially from the private sector, to pursue the Decade of Action and empower women and youth. Another said “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She called for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

On the challenges of reaching agreement on the declaration, delegates suggested that the process “focus on what unites us and avoid what divides us,” noting that this declaration cannot resolve all unfinished business from the last 75 years. Instead it should highlight areas of convergence, so the declaration and the anniversary commemoration can unite rather than polarize the membership.

Going forward, the co-facilitators will prepare an elements paper for the declaration. They plan to convene a meeting to discuss the elements in early April 2020. They said the UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary, Fabrizio Hochschild, will be invited to that meeting to provide updates on preparations for the anniversary and the related global consultation process.

The commemoration event will take place on 21 September 2020, at UN headquarters in New York, US. [IISD Sources]","UN Member States held their first informal consultations on a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN.

49,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/guide-applies-sdg-monitoring-and-evaluation-to-national-contexts/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Guide Applies SDG Monitoring and Evaluation to National Contexts,"The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the EVALSDGs network, Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have released a guide to designing SDG evaluation frameworks around existing national contexts. The authors apply their proposed process to the national contexts of Costa Rica, Finland, and Nigeria to illustrate ways to incorporate SDG evaluation throughout the policy planning cycle.

Launched in New York, US on 4 February 2020, the guide titled, ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs,’ argues that a “one-size-fits-all manual” cannot be successful in evaluating success on the SDGs at the national level. The publication reports that a common thread from input provided by 33 government representatives and evaluation specialists from 22 countries is that, if evaluation is to assist in aligning national policy with the 2030 Agenda, it must be bespoke, built around existing political and assessment systems.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The guide thus outlines four steps of evaluation development and design. They include:

Identify the overall objective and use of the evaluation, by consulting and engaging with different stakeholder groups (e.g. civil society organizations, parliamentarians);

Prepare for the evaluation by designing participatory processes, defining the scope and focus of the evaluation, and identifying the policies and plans to be evaluated;

Use 2030 Agenda principles (e.g. universality, equity, leave no one behind) to inform the evaluative criteria, and use the principles to develop the evaluation questions; and

Frame the evaluation according to the logic of national policies, develop and cost a communication plan.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing.

The guide offers indicative questions, suggested criteria and decision trees to help practitioners develop robust SDG evaluation plans tailored to their national contexts. Lessons from case studies in Costa Rica, Finland and Nigeria are applied to each of the above steps, demonstrating how the SDG evaluation can be integrated throughout the policy cycle.

The guide also highlights the ways in which SDG monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes and results can support national progress on sustainable development, and be integrated into national M&E systems. Early national experiences show that governments can use evaluative tools in: identifying issues that affect sustainable development trajectories and for formulating and adopting policies around those issues; establishing responsibilities to coordinate actions and allocate resources during policy implementation; and assessing the policies’ worth in the context of the SDGs and national priorities, to support optimal outcomes in line with key principles.

The guide also highlights methodological considerations to take into account when developing an SDG evaluation. Attributes of sustainable development evaluation include: robust stakeholder engagement—which should occur throughout the four steps—and co-generation of recommendations; mixed approaches to gathering evidence, including both quantitative and qualitative sources; integrative analysis, which reviews policies or programs from economic, social and environmental perspectives; assessing sustainable development interventions in current their spatial, temporal, socioeconomic and environmental contexts; and recognizing both upstream drivers and downstream effects, as well as impacts beyond national boundaries and across borders.

Acknowledging that there is no single way to monitor and evaluate progress against the Goals, and flagging disparities between countries in terms of their evaluation infrastructure and readiness, the authors emphasize that SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The SDGs are not meant to impose an additional layer of policies on top of current ones, but rather to serve as “a compass for aligning countries’ plans with their global commitments.”

The guide also outlines how SDG evaluation can inform countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) presented during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The publication was inspired by a workshop on ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs’, which convened in Helsinki, Finland, in March 2019 to foster cross-country learning and understanding on common challenges.

IPEN announced the findings during International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week in October 2019, and noted the need for strong bans on lead paint that would include all types of paint, not only decorative.

Manny Calonzo, IPEN Advisor, explained that “coatings on equipment inevitably flake and chip from weathering and regular wear and tear, become mixed in the sand and dirt, and put children at risk of life-long impairment from ingestion through normal hand to mouth behavior.” IPEN notes that safe and affordable alternatives to lead additives are widely available, and paint companies can obtain third-party certification through Lead Safe Paint.

In December 2019 and January 2020, we saw this in discussions and reports on adaptation finance. They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows. Discussions also focused on the need for current business models to adapt to increasing climate risks and transform production processes to halt nature loss.

Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about the level of progress made. On the one hand, they saw missed opportunities such as to determine how cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement on climate change should advance. On the other, they noted steady achievements in the work of scientific bodies. In January, lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II (WG II) continued to advance work on the Group’s contribution to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6), focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, due for release in October 2021.

Seen in the light of adaptation funding activities, identified impacts and needs, these recent discussions suggest that climate change adaptation requires a rethinking of production, redistribution and equity. This Policy Brief focuses on these and other recent developments that inform climate adaptation finance.

UNFCCC Reflects on Its Integration of Adaptation, Prepares for 2023 Global Stocktake

The Adaptation Committee, established in 2010 under the UNFCCC, issued a report reflecting on the evolution of adaptation in the climate regime and outlining its work towards the first global stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement scheduled in 2023. Titled, ‘25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC,’ the report was released at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December 2019. Citing findings from the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report draws attention to increasingly more urgent adaptation needs.

The report notes that rising adaptation costs are likely to range from USD 140 billion to 300 billion per annum by 2030, and could rise to between USD 280 billion and 500 billion per annum by 2050. The Committee highlights the specific roles of the Convention’s Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism to support adaptation. Reporting on its own activities, the Committee informs of its partnerships with international, regional and national stakeholders and its efforts on engaging the private sector. A strategy for private sector engagement was also discussed at the 57th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council in December.

Looking forward, the Adaptation Committee notes that the seventh review of the GEF, the oldest operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, will be initiated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC will also start key negotiations on the post-2025 finance goal. Over the course of 2020, developed countries are expected to make submissions on finance beyond 2020 and on the alignment of global finance with the Paris goals.

The Committee further outlines its work towards the 2023 global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assessment of collective progress towards achieving its long-term goals. The global stocktake will conduct a review of overall progress made towards achieving the global goal on adaptation and the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation action and support. Inputs for the stocktake will include reports from the “network of institutions” established to enhance adaptation actions.

COP 25 Agrees of Arrangements for Adaptation Fund Going Forward, But Further Work Remains

The Adaption Fund approved a record USD 188 million in new projects in 2019, and reached the milestone of 100 concrete adaptation projects financed in vulnerable developing countries. The Fund fosters country ownership and enables direct access to adaptation finance for applicants from accredited national implementing entities from developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. It provides new learning opportunities, such as e-learning programmes to enhance access to climate finance, and new grants that foster adaptation practices on the ground and scale up effective projects.

Given its important role and the benefits it creates for an increasing number of countries in need of adaptation finance, the Fund welcomed two decisions taken during the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December, on decreasing risks of interruptions in the Fund’s work. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted:

amendments to the Fund’s arrangements with the World Bank to provide services as its interim trustee, to now be an open-ended arrangement; and

a decision that there will be no end date attached to its memorandum of understanding with the GEF Council on the GEF hosting the Fund’s secretariat.

However, the fact that COP 25 failed to conclude negotiations on the modalities of cooperative approaches under Paris Agreement Article 6 left some open questions.

In line with previous decisions, the Fund has served the Paris Agreement since January 2019. It will no longer serve the Kyoto Protocol once the share of proceeds becomes available under the sustainable development mechanism of Agreement Article 6.4, though it will continue to receive the share of proceeds, if available, from activities under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

The failure to conclude negotiations at COP 25 leaves unclear precisely how much of the share of proceeds under Agreement Article 6.4 sustainable development mechanism will become available for the Adaptation Fund. There seems to be consensus on a minimum share of 2% but possible increases are still under discussion. Parties further disagreed, among others, on whether a share of proceeds would also come from both market-based approaches, namely transactions under the mechanism, as well as from the trading of Article 6.2 “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs). Many countries called for equal treatment of rules for both approaches, for a number of reasons. In the context of adaptation finance, developing countries highlighted the value of predictable funding. As reported by some analysts, many of the countries likely to be on the buying end, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Norway, are concerned about higher costs of their carbon offsets.

COP 25 also did not result in any decision on whether the membership representation of developing and developed countries on the Adaptation Fund Board should change, given its role in serving the Paris Agreement.

Tracking Adaptation Finance

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has set out to tackle significant data and reporting challenges to capturing global adaptation finance flows. Adaptation investment, the Initiative finds, is difficult to track due to challenges associated with context dependency, the uncertain causality of investments made, a lack of impact metrics, and confidentiality and reporting requirements.

For this reason, CPI’s report titled, ‘ Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019,’ does not track any private sector adaptation finance. The Initiative underlines that almost all adaptation finance covered in the report was funded by public actors and that the tracking of public domestic adaptation finance remains limited. Nevertheless, that report finds that adaptation finance gained momentum in 2017-2018, increasing 35% to an annual average of USD 30 billion from 2015-2016, although adaptation still accounts for just 5% of tracked climate finance based on available data.

In its subsequent December report titled, ‘Tracking Adaptation Finance: Advancing Methods to Capture Finance Flows in the Landscape,’ CPI briefs on potential methods to fill data gaps for the tracking of adaptation finance flows, and proposes methods to measure progress.

The proposed framework, the authors suggest, can serve to identify information that should be tracked and reported by local governments and companies. The aim is to improve the understanding, and, ultimately, delivery, of adaptation finance. CPI finds that:

Investment flows that are specific to adaptation and resilience must be understood in the context of the total investment that receives a resilience benefit from the incremental adaptation investment;

Adaptation- and resilience-focused flows should be measured against total investment by sector to understand progress made to achieve resilience against a benchmark; and

Technical approaches, such as keyword searches and investment matching against national adaptation goals and geographic climate risk, can help identify adaptation flows in datasets that do not label them as such.

World Economic Forum Recognizes Climate and “Nature-based” Risks

The World Economic Forum (WEF), which convened for its 50th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from 21-24 January 2020, issued its annual Global Risks Report 2020. Based on its Global Risks Perception Survey results, the Forum concurs with findings from other fora that climate change is the stand-out long-term risk the world faces. It stresses that the near-term consequences of climate change amount to a “planetary emergency” with catastrophic, wide-ranging and intersecting implications. The WEF report also ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years.

As a traditionally business-centric gathering, the WEF finds that USD 44 trillion of economic value generation is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Illustrating how nature loss impacts businesses’ operations, supply chains and markets, the Forum urges the business community to adapt to several nature-based risks and implications. These risks, explained in another WEF report titled, ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ can be assessed using climate risk categories as defined in the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Under its ‘Nature Action Agenda’ stakeholder platform, the Forum has identified areas where strategic transformation of current business models and production processes can contribute the most to halting and reversing nature loss, and ways to finance this transformation.

Climate Change Adaptation Requires Rethinking of Production, Redistribution and Equity

Reflecting on these discussions, one cannot ignore the diversity of stakeholder groups engaged in addressing climate change impacts and their growing need of global adaptation finance. That need is estimated at USD 180 billion annually from 2020-2030 and USD 50 billion annually from many developing countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. While the UNFCCC and its constituent bodies prepare for upcoming procedural tasks, and the IPCC is advancing work towards AR6 publication, others talk about business opportunities and revenues. Few can envision the estimated sums in question. Half of the world’s biggest companies say “climate adaptation solutions could result in USD 236 billion in increased revenue.” Some suggest that “in the food and land-use sector alone, the climate challenge provides an annual business opportunity of USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2030.” At the same time, those that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including African farmers and island nations, speak of securing their livelihoods and coping with the negative impacts of climate change while lacking the means to adapt.

One of the notions underpinning these contrasting discussions is equity, with its different meanings and undertones. In an effort to to answer the basic economic questions of production and distribution, which all societies grapple with, we could think of what products are going to be made and by what means. How are the claims on production and incomes divided among resource contributors? How is production divided between private and public purposes? And more pertinently perhaps, given the limited ecological capacity within which the established global economy has to function, how is production divided between the present and the future?","They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows.

This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In this context, the Policy Brief also discusses the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) decision to end funding fossil fuel energy projects.

EIB Ends Funding of Fossil Fuel Energy Projects

In November 2019, the EIB Board adopted a decision to end financing for fossil fuel energy projects by the end of 2021. In its energy lending policy, aimed at supporting the energy transformation, the Bank further laid out its climate action and environmental sustainability strategy and focus on support for clean energy and security.

Specifically, the policy change means that the Bank will phase out support to:

the production of oil and natural gas;

traditional gas infrastructure;

power generation technologies resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above 250 gCO2 per kWh of electricity generated; and

large-scale heat production infrastructure based on unabated oil, natural gas, coal or peat.

The Bank will potentially continue to approve gas infrastructure projects already formally under appraisal until the end of 2021, noting that switching from oil or coal to natural gas may reduce GHG emissions in the short term.

The EIB explains that it will support clean energy and security directly by: reinforcing electricity networks; reducing energy demand through energy efficiency projects or through low-carbon power generation; and deploying demand response or storage at scale. According to the policy, five principles will govern future EIB engagement in the energy sector:

Prioritizing energy efficiency with a view to supporting the new EU target under the EU Energy Efficiency Directive; Enabling energy decarbonization through increased support for low- or zero-carbon technology, aiming to meet a 32% renewable energy share throughout the EU by 2030; Increasing financing for decentralized energy production, innovative energy storage and e-mobility; Ensuring grid investment for new, intermittent energy sources like wind and solar as well as strengthening cross-border interconnections; and Increasing the impact of investment to support energy transformation outside the EU.

Furthermore, the EIB Group stated that it expects its financing to unlock EUR 1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainable investment in the decade to 2030. The Bank will gradually increase the share of its financing dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability to reach 50% of its operations in 2025.

Outside the EU, the Bank foresees to support energy access with the development of energy systems that are low-carbon, efficient and reliable. The Bank’s energy lending volume represents only a small fraction of the required investment outside the EU. Looking to finance projects that reinforce countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Bank will support projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and energy transformation in other regions, in particular Asia and Latin America.

Aiming to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

Collectively, the EIB and the EU and its member States are the largest providers of public climate finance globally to developing countries, accounting for EUR 21.7 billion in 2018, including EUR 2.65 billion from the European Commission and EUR 2.97 billion from the EIB. The European Commission highlights this collective commitment, which kept increasing over the past five years, in the Fourth Biennial Report from the EU to the UNFCCC.

Like the EU, most developed country Parties have also submitted their biennial reports, as requested, by January 2020. These reports inform of Annex I Parties’: quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets; progress made towards their achievement, including information on mitigation actions and their effects, the estimates of emission reductions and removals, and the use of units from market-based mechanisms and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities; GHG emission trends and projections; and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing country Parties.

This information is relevant for the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal as well as adaptation and finance objectives, which are expressed in general terms in the Agreement’s provision articulating its purpose. On finance, Parties agreed to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” (Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c)).The EU’s BR4 stands out in this regard as it reports on EU’s implementation of this provision.

The European Commission explains its commitment to mainstream climate change mitigation and adaptation into all major EU spending programmes, with reference to the EIB’s Energy Lending Policy and the 2020 EU budget. With total commitments set at EUR 168.7 billion, the budget was endorsed in November 2019. To meet the goal of dedicating at least 20% of EU expenditure to climate protection in the period 2014-2020, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU agreed to increase the focus on climate-related actions in several areas. These include research and development, transport and energy infrastructure and the EU’s external action. Additional funds of EUR 590 million were allocated to the EU’s LIFE programme, the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and climate action, with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion for the 2014-2020 funding period. The European Commission also informs of its pledge to report on the “at least 25%” earmarking for the next financial framework 2021-2027.

The EU’s aim to make finance flows consistent with its climate commitments involves:

revenue spending from auctioning of EU ETS allowances;

diverting subsidies under the Renewable Energy Directive for transport sector from biofuel feedstocks with high indirect land use change emissions risks;

developing metrics and monitoring methodologies to track progress concerning finance flows; and

mobilizing the private sector through sustainable finance initiative and climate-related financial disclosure requirements.

Tracking Progress on the Paris Agreement’s Long-term Finance Goal

The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) is preparing the 2020 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. For this purpose, the Committee has called for submissions on evidence, including a list of needed information and data, with regard to:

methodological issues relating to measuring, reporting, and verifying climate finance flows;

data on climate-related finance flows;

assessment of the effectiveness of climate finance flows, including drivers, impact results, meeting needs, and access; and

information relevant to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c).

A call for improving understanding of finance flows was also heard during discussions at the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December 2019. Parties’ views, however, diverged on establishing a common definition of climate finance and on commencing work on the new collective post-2025 finance goal prior to the scheduled negotiations, to commence at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020.

At its 21st meeting in October 2019, the SCF addressed the determination of the needs of developing country Parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, which Parties had mandated the SCF to report on every four years, beginning in 2020. Prior to the meeting, the UNFCCC overhauled its Climate Finance Data Portal, which captures information, graphics and figures for a better understanding of climate finance flows, and informs of activities funded in developing countries to implement climate action, particularly financial flows that have been channeled, mobilized and leveraged by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It also presents information on Adaptation Fund project data related to entities, projects and programmes approved by the Adaptation Fund Board.

Defining Ways to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

According to the findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), momentum for aligning climate finance flows with the Paris Agreement is growing. Which multilateral development banks (MDBs) will follow in the EIB’s footsteps and take measures in support of the energy transformation? In its report titled, ‘Aligning Development Co-operation and Climate Action: The Only Way Forward,’ the OECD stressed that, in the case of “development finance,” support for energy efficiency and renewables has increased since the Paris Agreement, but continues to be undermined by financing for new fossil fuel-based energy. That means multilateral providers overall, which accounted for 77% of funding of fossil fuel activities in 2016 and 2017, need to change.

The complexity of “climate finance” is illustrated by data gaps, and heated negotiations characterized by diverging views on: what constitutes “new and additional” climate funding; whether climate finance should be excluded from being counted as official development assistance (ODA); and using private sector investments to meet climate finance needs.

Nevertheless, though drafted in general terms, the Paris Agreement provision on “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” reflects a certain degree of agreement among Parties. As the wording suggests, such efforts may entail whatever lies within state power, for example regulations, green fiscal policies, and providing public sustainable development aid to cause finance to flow in the direction of carbon neutrality. Yet given the time pressure to achieve the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, some have pointed to a growing realization that while necessary, globally, public finance alone may not be sufficient. While welcome, announcements such as by the EIB to double its share of sustainable financing to 50% are not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, making palpable the need for private sector investments at scale.

Private sector stakeholders, in turn, are certainly aware of their own climate change risks, including the issue of stranded assets, as noted in recent news. Companies are beginning to change their business models, expecting future revenues from demand for low-emission products and services. How this will influence climate finance flows, however, remains to be seen. Governments will have to identify their role in transforming economies and determine how to enable a shift in economic activities. In affluent societies, this may warrant considerations of basing these activities not only on the principle of “eco-efficiency,” which focuses on increasing output per unit of input, but also “eco-sufficiency,” which requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste and emissions in absolute terms.","This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

To promote a shift towards circularity, the initiative calls on all tourism companies and destinations to take concrete actions to tackle plastic pollution and increase plastics recycling.

The Global Tourism Plastics initiative aims to reduce plastic pollution from the tourism sector through a set of actionable commitments by 2025. The Initiative will work to eliminate unnecessary or problematic plastic packaging and support the shift from single-use plastic towards reusable alternatives or models by 2025. The Initiative will also engage the value chain to promote 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable and commit to collaborate and invest in increasing the recycling and composting rate for plastics.

The Initiative is an activity of the One Planet Network’s Sustainable Tourism Programme, a multi-stakeholder partnership to implement SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The Initiative acts as the interface between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and the tourism sector. The New Plastics Economy Global Manager, Gerald Naber, said the initiative will unite the tourism sector behind a “vision for a world in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution.” He emphasized that concerted action can help eliminate unneeded plastics and drive innovation to ensure that needed plastics “can be safely and easily circulated—keeping them in the economy and out of the environment.”

UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili welcomed the Initiative as an opportunity for tourism companies and destinations “to step forward and lead the global effort addressing plastic pollution.” He encouraged Initiative participants to set quantifiable targets and help accelerate the tourism sector’s transformation towards more integrated solutions and circular business models.

The Initiative will report annually on progress made towards its targets.

The declaration was named for the COP’s host city in India.

In addition to the Declaration’s call, a High-Level Segment also contributed outcomes for integration in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected to be adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference, in October, in Kunming, China. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Acting Executive Secretary, informed COP 13 participants that the post-2020 biodiversity framework will be simple and transformative, but unlikely to include targets other than those already in the Aichi Targets.

Towards this end, the High-Level Segment discussed priorities for migratory species conservation in the framework, with speakers highlighting that this was the first CMS COP since the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) sounded the alarm that a million species, including many migratory species, might be lost in the coming decade. Ministers and other high-level participants emphasized the need to mainstream biodiversity across all sectors, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches. They also called for including migratory species considerations in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions on climate change.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices. Seven were added to Appendix I, which comprises migratory species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The seven species added to Appendix I included the Asian elephant, jaguar, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, little bustard, antipodean albatross and the oceanic white-tip shark.

The Urial sheep, smooth hammerhead shark, and the tope shark were listed for protection under Appendix II, which covers migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status and that require international cooperation for their conservation and management. In addition, new and extended Concerted Actions with targeted conservation plans were approved for 14 species.

The Earth Negotiation Bulletin report from COP13 also indicates that Parties also agreed on the following measures benefiting migratory species:

integrate biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy;

strengthen initiatives to combat the illegal killing, taking, and trade of migratory birds;

mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species;

deepen the understanding of the importance of animal culture and social complexity for the conservation of endangered species; and

investigate possible trade in CMS Appendix I species and the implications for their conservation status.

CMS COP13 and the associated meetings of the Standing Committee met from 15-22 February 2020. It brought together 2,550 people, including 263 delegates representing 82 parties, 11 delegates from five non-party countries, 50 representatives from UN agencies, 70 representatives of international non-governmental organizations, 127 representatives of national non-governmental organizations, and over 100 members of both national and international media.

Opening speakers set the tone for the Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 8-13 February 2020. Falah Mohammad Al Ahbabi, Chairman of Abu Dhabi’s Department of Municipalities and Transport, pointed to mass migration and technological progress as two trends demanding a “renewed understanding of locality,” which includes safety, inclusiveness and social cohesion. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said via video that urbanization continues to feature high rates of inequality, and called for all stakeholders, including local governments, to partner with the UN to tackle the climate emergency.

The UN-Habitat Executive Director called for turning urbanization into a net positive contributor to life on Earth.

Ashraf Ghani, President of Afghanistan, said that organizational cultures in “communities of knowledge” constitute a significant constraint, suggesting that several international organizations are “still reflections of a different world.” Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama emphasized the need to make urban living synonymous with sustainability. UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif noted that “SDG 11 is where all of the SDGs come together,” and called for turning urbanization into a net positive contributor to life on Earth.

More than 18,000 participants registered for the Forum, which began with five Assembly meetings of the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) constituency groups that provided input to the Habitat III process, namely women, youth, grassroots, and the World Assembly for Local and Regional Government.

Among the initiatives launched and discussed during WUF10 were UN-Habitat’s launch of the ‘SDG Project Assessment Tool: an innovative tool for inclusive, sustainable and effective urban projects,’ as well as ‘RISE UP: resilient settlements for the urban poor,’ which seeks to mobilize and coordinate large-scale investments in climate change adaptation and resilience for the urban poor. Penny Abeywardena, Mayor’s Office of International Affairs, New York City, US, issued a call for local and regional governments to sign the Voluntary Local Review Declaration, noting that 20 new cities had already done so at WUF10.

Examples from countries and local communities discussed during WUF10 included the following:

a program in the Municipality of Mogadishu, Somalia, aimed at introducing the country’s youth to its pre-conflict history;

the use of sport as a critical space for “meeting and resocialization,” with the city of Medellín, Colombia reporting that it has succeeded in decreasing drug trafficking and use by engaging communities in sports;

Senegal’s experience in using industrial taxes to subsidize housing programmes and creating dedicated housing funds;

Jordan’s model of distributing land and houses at affordable prices;

the work of the Bear Clan Patrol Inc., in Winnipeg, Canada, which draws on traditional clan roles to support safety and cultural restoration for indigenous communities in the city; and

examples of involvement from youth in many countries, including a presentation by Martin Lucas Sortland Eick, Norwegian youth delegate, regarding his efforts to see youth “take true ownership” of SDG implementation in his country.

At the close of WUF10, delegates adopted the Abu Dhabi Declared Actions, the main outcome document of the meeting. The document presents participants’ perspectives on the relationship between culture, innovation, and urban development. In the Declared Actions, participants highlight that: culture is fundamental to identity and heritage, and is an integral part of the solution to the challenges of urbanization; cities are the incubators of social, economic, environmental, political and cultural progress; linking data, innovation and advances in science and technology with policy is critical for implementing the 2015 New Urban Agenda (NUA) and achieving the SDGs; and further action and commitments by actors at the local, national and global levels are welcomed in support of the NUA and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among the pledges included in the Abu Dhabi Declared Actions document are several organizations’ commitment to making cities resilient by 2030 and Fiji’s commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In closing remarks, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande commended WUF10 for marking one of the first events of the UN Decade of Action. He described culture and innovation as key for promoting socially cohesive, peaceful and resilient societies, noting that culture plays a critical role in fostering human rights and peaceful coexistence. He described the NUA as one of the most important blueprints to achieving sustainable cities, and called for innovation to become more climate resilient and better prepared for disaster recovery and risk reduction.

These are welcome steps given the critical condition of India’s water sector, which is highly stressed.

Water resources are limited. The water demand in all sectors by 2050 is estimated to exceed its supply. While demand is growing, the quality of water supply is dwindling. Per capita water supply is declining on an annual basis and is likely to touch the benchmark of water-scarce supply in the coming years. Groundwater levels are also decreasing, although globally, India is the highest user of groundwater, especially in irrigation and domestic sectors. Its quality is also a cause of concern.

SDG 6.1 stipulates achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking for all by 2030. Under the Jal Jivan Mission (JJM) scheme, India launched the programme to provide piped water connections (at 55 litres per head per day) to 14.6 crore rural households by 2024. An amount of Rs 3.6 lakh crore (with a Central share of Rs 2.08 lakh crore) has been approved for this scheme over the five year period. During 2020-21 (Table 1), an allocation of Rs 11,500 crore (15% more than the revised estimate for 2019-20) for connecting 1.15 crore household through functionally piped connections in rural areas, has been made. Under this programme, source sustainability measures for augmenting water supply through rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and management of greywater for reusing wastewater, have been envisaged through gram panchayats which should play a crucial role in planning, designing, execution, operations and maintenance of the in-village infrastructure.

SDG 6.2 goals are required to be achieved by India through access to adequate sanitation and hygiene for all, and ending open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women, girls, and those in vulnerable situations. Having made substantial progress under the Swachh Bharat Mission and declaring the country as open defecation free (ODF), India is determined to continue to take steps for liquid and solid faecal waste management, post toilet construction. Accordingly, it has allocated Rs 12,294 crore (25% more than the revised estimate of 2019-20) for FY 2020-21 for achieving the ‘ODF plus’ status of sanitation component. This is also a welcome step.

Water quality has to be improved by reducing pollution (SDG 6.3) by 2030. For cleaning the river, allocation of funds under Namami Gange (Rs 800 crore) for Ganga cleaning and National River conservation (Rs 840 crore) for cleaning other rivers, has been made during 2020-21. SDG 6.6 mandates protecting and restoring water-related ecosystem such as wetlands, rivers, aquifers. These two programmes address this aspect as well. There is no fund allocated for grey water management for recycling and reuse of wastewater as required under SDG (6.3), although this aspect is proposed to be covered under the JJM scheme while giving access to water.

India’s water use efficiency in all sectors is not satisfactory. For example, India’s water use is highest in the irrigation sector (80%) and its efficiency is only 38%. To address the improvement of the efficiency, PMKSY (‘per drop more crop’) scheme was launched using micro-irrigation technology. India’s potential for micro-irrigation is an area of 70 million hectares and the achievement till 2018 is only 9 million hectares. PMKSY is a Centrally sponsored scheme and states’ meaningful participation is essential. Budget 2020-21 allocated Rs 4,000 crore, which is almost double the RE 2019-2020 amount and is substantial.

Unfortunately, increasing water use efficiency in the domestic and industrial sectors was not touched upon in the Budget, although the SDG 6.4 mandates increasing efficiency in all sectors. To ensure sustainable water withdrawals, an allocation of Rs 200 crore under Atal Bhujal Yojana for incentivising and effective groundwater management is a welcome step. In addition, PMKSY (Har khet ko pani) and integrated watershed management have been allocated higher funds during 2020-21 for addressing source sustainability measures.

Given the allocation of funds for water and sanitation sectors was Rs 30,478 crore for 2020-21 (higher than the 2019-20 figure by about 20%), India’s commitment to implementing the SDG 6 goal is evident. Since water and sanitation are state subjects, the states’ full participation in the implementation of schemes is essential. Given the past achievements in sanitation sectors, there is much hope for overcoming the enormous challenges in the water sector.

Operations are expected to begin in Q2 2020 with investment in early stage startups focused on addressing ESG issues such as climate change and the empowerment of women. ADB Ventures has a 17-year fund life, which means it can invest long-term capital into the projects selected.



Mike Barrow, director general for private sector operations, ADB, says: “This region is brimming with technology solutions to conserve energy, reduce waste, fight climate change, and deliver public services effectively.



“Our vision is for ADB Ventures to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to achieve the SDGs by 2030.”

Impact technology solutions refer to specially designed technologies which are fundamentally aimed at making a positive impact toward ESG factors.

Barrow continues: “ADB Ventures will help bring these solutions to market by leveraging our extensive operational networks and filling the risk capital gap facing innovative early-stage companies in developing Asia and the Pacific, particularly smaller and frontier markets.”

ADB differentiates itself from a typical VC fund by going beyond the sourcing and provision of capital. ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 (the facility’s anchor trust fund) is augmented by a $12 million technical assistance program that will be deployed to the startups over three years. The program is two-pronged, with the ADB Ventures SEED grant program promoting expansion into emerging markets and the validation and de-risking of technology pilots.

The second leg of the assistance program, ADB Venture Lab provides a suite of innovation programs and will generate technology pilot opportunities to the anchor fund’s portfolio companies.



The announcement echoes a recent wave of banks and other large institutions making significant pledges to allocate resources toward sustainable ventures and re-align their portfolios to meet self-imposed carbon neutral commitments.



Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BlackRock and JP Morgan are just a handful of industry leaders working toward these goals, some of which are also deploying impact investing funds to support environmentally focused fintechs.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), has established the ADB Ventures platform to feed investment and support to Asian startups which are developing solutions aimed at achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Crysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

Benjamin de Haan, SDG director of transportation and planning services told council on Feb. 18 that he was very satisfied with the tenders that had been received for the project.

“Here it is finally, after all this time we’re here awarding the project for the Crysler Bridge,” he said. We’re very happy with the price. This is a full rehabilitation of the bridge and it is on budget.”

The project will see the county spend $1,533,000 on the rehabilitation, plus the harmonized sales tax. Tenders for the project had initially been issued last year, but every one of them had been over budget. This resulted in SDG staff modifying the project, cutting down on its cost.

“Last year’s low bid was $1.9 million and our budget was of $1.2 million,” said de Haan. “So we obviously made adjustments to the tender, as you can see. Some of those changes include extending the construction schedule.”","Article contentCrysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

Ironically, hardly anything can be obtained in exchange for water. On the other hand, diamonds have little use, but a large amount of other goods and services may be obtained in exchange for diamonds. This apparent contradiction, known as the ""Diamond-Water Paradox"", was discussed by Adam Smith in his magnum opus titled ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"". Smith stumbled upon the Diamond-Water Paradox whilst attempting to formulate his theory of value. He decomposed the word ""value"" into two parts: ""value in use"" and ""value in exchange"". Water has a high value in use, but a low value in exchange; diamonds have a low value in use, but a high value in exchange. Carl Menger and William Stanley Jevons later showed that value in exchange, or market price, depends not on the total usefulness of a commodity, but rather on its additional usefulness. The total usefulness of water is greater than that of diamonds. However, the usefulness of each additional glass of water is less than the usefulness of each additional diamond. This is because we consume so many glasses of water that each additional glass does not seem to matter much to us. On the other hand, we do not purchase as many diamonds, and so each additional diamond means a lot to us.

Although the Diamond-Water Paradox has been largely resolved, there are serious implications of a beautiful rock being more expensive than an indispensable liquid. This is because market price affects our perception of relative importance, and our perception of relative importance ultimately influences what we save and what we squander. Thus, diamonds are highly prized in society, but water is often wasted. While it may be common to exchange diamond rings during marriage, an exchange of glasses of water for the same purpose would be utterly inconceivable. We tend to feel at ease exchanging ornamental diamonds while allowing life-giving water to go down the drain.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) acknowledge the importance of water in human development. SDG 6 calls upon countries to ""ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"" by 2030. Access to ""at least basic drinking water"" refers to the availability of drinking water from sources such as piped water, boreholes or tube-wells, protected dug-wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water, whose collection time, including queueing, does not exceed 30 minutes for a round trip. The percentage of the population using at least basic drinking water services in Bangladesh increased from 95.60 percent in 2005 to 97.32 percent in 2015. Unfortunately, there was almost no improvement in access to safely managed drinking water, over the same period of time.

Apart from access to drinking water, SDG 6 also emphasises the importance of sanitation. SDG target 6.2 aims to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030. Access to ""at least basic sanitation"" refers to the availability of sanitation facilities such as flush or pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, and compositing toilets or pit latrines with slabs, which are not shared with other households. According to data from the global database of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, the proportion of the total population in Bangladesh with access to basic sanitation services increased from 25.3 percent in 2000 to 46.9 percent in 2015. Additionally, the gap between rural and urban sanitation access also narrowed over the years. For example, in 2000, rural areas had 20.16 percent less access to basic sanitation compared to urban areas, but in 2015 this difference was reduced to 10.26 percent. In terms of geographic differences, Chattogram division had the highest and Barishal division had the lowest access to basic sanitation in 2015. Improvement in access to basic sanitation means that open defecation has been virtually eliminated from Bangladesh, even from rural areas. In 2005, the percentage of the population practicing open defecation was 11.91 percent nationally and 14.96 percent in rural areas. However, by 2015, the percentage of the population practicing open defecation fell to 0.10 percent nationally and 0.16 percent in rural areas.

Despite the progress made in improving access to water and sanitation in Bangladesh, a number of key challenges still remain. These include, inter alia, widespread inefficient use of water, lack of sustainable management of surface and ground water, low wastewater treatment, high levels of water pollution and poor quality of water. Additionally, lack of drinking water and sanitation facilities are reducing the efficacy of education and healthcare services where they are needed the most. Furthermore, inequalities are present in access to water and sanitation between urban and rural areas, as well as between slums and formal urban settlements. The existing pricing scheme used by the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is based on a single water meter for an entire building, and so does not create incentives for economical use of water by individual households. The poorest households in the capital city have limited access to water, and are often compelled to obtain water from illegal water vendors at exorbitantly high prices. In order to achieve SDG 6 by 2030, these challenges need to be tackled urgently by adopting sustainable integrated water management practices that consider both current and future needs of water and sanitation.

For the sluggish progress to date has been primarily a consequence of ‘putting all our eggs in one basket’ and expecting the state to deliver the SDGs, which it cannot.

A prime obstacle in that is finance. The SDG Center for Africa estimates the financing gap to achieve the SDGs is running at between $500bn and $1.2tn a year. That is simply beyond the reach of the public sector, with the Center estimating that delivering basic state functions of health care, education, water, energy, and road infrastructure requires more than 50 per cent of the GDP of most African countries.

However, for the private sector, pursuing the 2030 goals of eradicating Africa’s hunger, poverty, and inequality and improving healthcare will deliver its own rewards, creating business opportunities worth more than a trillion dollars a year, according to United Nation estimates.

In the absence of that private sector mobilisation, progress remains achingly slow.

The 2019 Sustainable Development Goal Three-Year Reality Checker Report found only five countries in Africa - Seychelles, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria - that had met the SDG target of three per cent poverty by 2015.

Yet the problem is substantially one of mindset. For, while achieving the right policies and public investment is necessary for delivering the SDGs, we need to abandon the idea that it is enough and focus more rigorously on developing SDG aligned businesses.

It is not viable to expect nation-states to achieve a tax take, or a debt load, of 50 per cent of GDP to deliver basic services when the continent is home to a vast informal sector that contributes no government revenue at all. That ‘basic needs’ bill is just unmeetable without a leap forward in business and GDP growth.

And just as public sector SDG success depends on private sector take-off, so too does the private sector’s success.

Investing in SDG-focused businesses, calculates the UN, would create over 85 million jobs in Africa by 2030, which would, in turn, create new consumers and new markets.

Indeed, even relatively small investments in SDG-focused businesses can produce huge returns. For instance, investing in agriculture technology to reduce food waste could generate $57bn a year in additional revenues, based on evidence from Rwanda, where small metal silos or plastic crates have reduced post-harvest losses by over 60 per cent and increased smallholder farmers’ incomes by more than 30 per cent.

If private businesses collaborate with local governments to provide larger infrastructures, such as ports, oil and gas extractives, power plants and automotive, shared revenue of over $296bn could be generated and nearly 16 million jobs, according to the UN’s estimates. There could be further benefits too from using local materials for such works.

Likewise, providing affordable housing, clean water and sanitation, infrastructure and energy solutions, such as solar lanterns and improved cooking stoves to urban dwellers, has a potential revenue value of $214bn a year and could create over 32 million jobs.

Such growth is typical for businesses focused on achieving SDGs. Indeed, research conducted by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) shows that business that is focused on SDG areas also achieves more value locally.

For instance, reports the BSDC, 71 per cent of the value of food and agriculture businesses is retained in developing countries, 60 per cent of health and wellness businesses, 54 per cent of energy and materials, and 54 per cent of the value of upgrading and developing new cities.

Overall, business models that are directed towards achieving Africa’s SDGs have proven to work to the benefit of both consumers and businesses, which is why thy lie at the heart of all we are doing at Intellecap and at next week’s 7th Sankalp Summit for entrepreneurs in Nairobi.

Our initiatives to support private sector SDG initiatives include research, partnerships and projects spanning ideal adaptive technologies, such as rural solar mini-grids; private sector capacity building among communities displaced by projects such as the Olkaria geothermal plant; and assisting small producers into value addition and niche markets, in tea, in bamboo, and multiple other high potential areas.

We have no doubt that without recalibration of our private sector SDG efforts, the 2030 goals for Africa will go unmet, whereas if we now see and seize this opportunity, no African will be left untouched by the benefits borne of SDG-focused entrepreneurs.

Article content The Eastern Ontario Health Unit is providing regular status updates on the quarantine at the Cornwall NAV CENTRE. Our... Posted by Eastern Ontario Health Unit on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 In its regular update on Tuesday, the EOHU indicated the testing laboratory set up at CFB Trenton would now be moving to the Nav Centre as the people quarantined in Trenton reached the end of their 14-day stay and were released. The daily update also indicated one person at the Nav Centre was transported to Cornwall Community Hospital on Monday for medical reasons unrelated to the COVID-19. “There were transfers of quarantined individuals to hospitals in Trenton for medical reasons not related to COVID-19, and we do expect them here as well,” Roumeliotis is quoted as saying in the update— though he did not volunteer this information during his update to city council Monday. All precautions were taken by Cornwall-SDG EMS in transporting the person, and the Cornwall Community Hospital is equipped and prepared to isolate the person while providing treatment. If well enough to be released before the 14-day quarantine is lifted, the person would return to the Nav Centre. During his presentation, Roumeliotis praised the quarantine area, calling it an ideal location, being completely walled off and having a tunnel leading to it. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking to Nav employees,” he said. “I know that some are worried. I’m also getting phone calls from schools saying that kids are being bullied now because their parents work at the Nav. Some parents are refusing to send their kids to daycares and to schools because their parents are working at the Nav Centre.”

Dr John Adabie Appiah, the President of PSG, who made the call said access to paediatric services was increasing across the country and has become necessary to have more experts to expand their services to every corner of the country.

Dr Appiah was speaking at the PSG’s two-day maiden Annual General and Scientific Meeting in Accra on the theme; “Building Partnerships to Achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3”.

The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Newborns, children and adolescents in Ghana are faced with a myriad of health challenges, which must be addressed holistically.

He said with the failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, Ghana has no excuse but to accelerate efforts to be counted among the ‘elite’ nations of SDG high-fliers.

“This calls for more than doubling our efforts, pooling resources together and working with each other and trust that we can do better,” he stated.

According to him, the Society was seriously looking into the uneven distribution of child health experts in some parts of the country adding that, this is a major issue, which compromised the quality of care.

Dr Appiah said in as much as Ghanaian child health experts are taking up positions across the country than before, there was the need to identify additional factors and dynamics contributing to child mortality.

He called on skilled personnel to address problems such as lower respiratory tract infections and sustain immunization to save children.

Mrs Cynthia Morrison, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, commended the Society for meeting to further discuss the well-being of children.

She said Ghana had demonstrated clear commitment by ensuring that the SDGs were maintained and coordinated into the President’s programme of economic and social development policy.

In achieving the goals, the Ministry she said adopted a multi sectorial approach in the implementation of its policies and programmes.

“To further strengthen inter agency partnership to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages, an inter-sectorial standard operating procedure for child protection and family welfare development for children under zero to three have been finalized under the early Childhood Care and Development policy,” she said.

This policy including others give the overall framework direction for protection and promotion of the vulnerable.

This, she said, could not be achieved by the Ministry alone but needed partnerships to ensure common goals and targets and urged all not to relent on their efforts in achieving the SGDs.

Mrs Linda Asante-Agyei, the Vice President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), speaking on the role of the media in achieving the SGD 3, urged journalists to ensure that policies and laws regarding the well- being of children were implemented through their writings.

She said Ghana has made tremendous progress on new policies such as the Child and Family Welfare Policy and Justice for All Children policy and advised journalists to monitor commitments made by government and other organizations through continuous tracking and assessment of programmes.

“We must ensure that children receive the best care and improve their wellbeing to take up the mantle of developing the nation,” she noted.

Mrs Asante-Agyei urged the PSG to deepen their collaboration with the GJA to ensure that journalists report effectively on children issues.

She said this was important as it would help do away with wrong reporting on children since they were sensitive group of people.

The two day programme witnessed a lot of presentations, business meeting, exhibitions, awards and dinner dance.","The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

65,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unece-releases-statistical-portrait-of-regions-sdg-progress/,"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNECE Releases Statistical Portrait of Region’s SDG Progress,"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has launched a first regional report on SDG progress. The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

The UNECE Statistical Division prepared the first annual SDG progress report to inform the 2020 RFSD.

66,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/asia-pacific-off-track-20-of-sdg-indicators-predicted-to-be-worse-in-2030/,"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Asia-Pacific Off Track: 20% of SDG Indicators Predicted to be Worse in 2030,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has released its annual SDG progress report, finding that the region’s performance is “poor” on most measurable environmental targets. The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

In some areas, work is shifting to alternative virtual formats, such as the UN’s Fifth Committee on administrative and budgetary matters.

By early March, a number of announcements regarding the postponement or cancellation of meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic had been made. The UN Commission on the Status of Women held a historically short meeting for its 64th session, convening for a half-day on 9 March 2020 to adopt a political declaration before suspending. The CSW usually brings together thousands of participants the world for a two-week session and hundreds of side events.

Also acting early to adjust major plans were the World Bank and IMF, which transitioned the annual Spring Meetings scheduled for mid-April to a virtual format. The World Bank announced that it would cancel or postpone “all major events and conferences until further notice,” including the cancellation of the 2020 Land and Poverty Conference scheduled for 16-20 March. In cancelling the 19th session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which was scheduled for April 2020, members of the Forum noted the “already precarious health situation that many indigenous peoples live in, and the imperative to avoid adverse impacts.”

On 10 March, the ECOSOC Youth Forum and a Youth Plenary in preparation for the UN’s 75th anniversary were postponed. On 11 March, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to postpone the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 4) on an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), with new dates to be determined (decision 74/543). IGC 4 had been scheduled to convene from 23 March to 3 April. UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also announced that two high-level events would not go forward: the High-level Interactive Panel on Anti-microbial Resistance, scheduled for 14 April 2020; and the High-level event to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, scheduled for 24 April 2020.

On 11 March, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) circulated a list of proposed changes to the Council’s meeting calendar, inviting Member States’ views. She subsequently announced instead, “we need to remain flexible.”

On 17 March, the UNGA President announced that in-person, formal meetings of the UNGA “should not be organized at this time.” He suggested that the UNGA adopt any essential decisions via silence procedure, and agreeing on a simple procedure for postponing meetings. By a separate letter, he said he had decided to cancel all in-person meetings of the UNGA’s mandated processes for the 74th session that are scheduled to be held up to 17 April 2020, stating that, “These processes will conduct their activities via alternative mechanisms.” On mandated UNGA events scheduled for after 17 April 2020, he said discussions are ongoing.

The UNGA President said officials are considering alternative ways to adopt key decisions (instead of in-person meetings), and that the UNGA’s Fifth Committee has “successfully started conducting informal meetings via the UN’s Video Conference Tool (VCT).” ECOSOC, too, is exploring virtual options and solutions, according to the President’s statement on 18 March.

Additional ECOSOC meetings and events have been postponed or cancelled, as follows:

The 19th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), 30 March-3 April: Postponed

2020 ECOSOC Partnership Forum, 3 April: Cancelled

2020 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum), 20-23 April: Postponed until after April 2020

SDG Investment Fair, 20-22 April: Cancelled

Other ECOSOC meetings that fall within the eight-week timeframe are:

The UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), 4-8 May; and

The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum), 12-13 May.

Later in May, the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) is scheduled for 14-15 May, and the ECOSOC segment on Operational Activities for Development (OAS) is planned to convene from 19-21 May.

Negotiations on outcome documents of upcoming meetings, such as the ministerial declaration of the HLPF/high-level segment of ECOSOC in July 2020, may not take place in person.

Four out of five of the UN regions have had to postpone their annual regional fora for sustainable development or switch to a virtual format. The exception is the UN Economic Commission for Africa, which convened the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) from 24-27 February 2020. These regional sessions comprise an important part of the preparations for the July session of the HLPF.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) has been organizing preparations for the fifth UN conference on the LDCs, which will convene in Qatar in 2021 (UNLDC-V). Regional review meetings to inform these preparations have been postponed both for Africa, in Malawi, and Asia-Pacific, in Bangladesh.

On climate change, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is not organizing in-person meetings until the end of April 2020 and official missions have been suspended. The regional climate weeks have been postponed, as has the 2020 NAP Expo among other planned meetings. The Adaptation Committee will meet virtually instead of its in-person meeting from 24-27 March.

On biodiversity, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced the postponement of a number of meetings, including the 24th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice of the CBD and the third Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation of the CBD. Both of these meetings are expected to feed into the preparations for the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is scheduled to take place in October 2020, in China and is expected to adopt a global biodiversity framework for the post-2020 period.

On chemicals and waste management, the fourth meeting of the intersessional process for Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 was postponed, having been scheduled to convene in Bucharest, Romania, from 23-27 March 2020. The meeting will feed into the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), which is scheduled to take place from 5-9 October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.

The Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm has announced that an upcoming meeting in Ottawa, Canada and an upcoming meeting in Rome, Italy have been suspended, while the first meeting of the small intersessional working group on the strategic framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention for 2012–2021, scheduled for 31 March to 2 April 2020, will take place online. Preparations are continuing for the 2020 COP meetings of each convention, and a final decision will be made five weeks before the scheduled dates. These meetings, all scheduled to convene in Geneva, are:

Our relationship with forests is a prime example.

Forests are among the most biodiverse of Earth’s ecosystems. They sequester carbon and help to mitigate against climate change. They protect watersheds and help to control soil erosion. And yet, around 11% of carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation and forest degradation, which is second only to the energy sector.

The 21st of March was the International Day of Forests, and it convened under the theme of forests and biodiversity. This is fitting in 2020, the beginning of a critical decade for the planet. There will be landmark moments early in the decade, including the anticipated adoption of a new post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

The United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) is a Centre of global excellence in biodiversity. Over the past 10 years, we have been closely involved with REDD+, an initiative under the climate change convention (UNFCCC) that aims to support developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to promote the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests. Working closely with the UN-REDD Programme, we help countries to plan for and access results-based payments for these actions.

In work led by UNEP-WCMC, the UN-REDD Programme has supported over 20 developing countries to analyze where REDD+ actions could result in multiple benefits beyond carbon. Through spatial analyses carried out in close collaboration with national partners, countries have been empowered to identify areas that have potential for forest conservation, restoration and sustainable management, and can also help secure a range of additional important benefits for people and planet.

These analyses have shown how sustainable forest practices across the planet can contribute to a wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals.

One such example is Costa Rica. The National REDD+ Secretariat, together with FONAFIFO (the country’s National Forestry Financing Fund) and the UN-REDD Programme used spatial analyses to explore where REDD+ actions could help secure benefits beyond carbon, such as enhanced water regulation to support communities vulnerable to water stress, the potential for socio-economic improvements from forest-dependent livelihoods, and from ecotourism.

The work emphasized areas of overlap between the National REDD+ Strategy and spatial priorities for Costa Rica’s other objectives, such as national development, restoration and biodiversity conservation. Considering these benefits when planning and implementing REDD+ will help progress towards SDGs 1 (No Poverty); 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation); 13 (Climate Action); and 15 (Life on Land), among others.

More recently, this work also featured in the development of Costa Rica’s Gender Action Plan (contributing to SDG 5 on Gender Equality). Spatial layers showing the proportion of women by district contributed additional insight and helped to highlight districts where women could act as conservation agents, support efforts to reduce forest fires, and undertake reforestation activities.

Another example is Côte d’Ivoire, where we collaborated with the country’s REDD+ Permanent Executive Secretariat and the Swiss Scientific Research Centre to develop a forest restoration opportunities map. This combined potential benefits, such as carbon density, soil erosion risk and species richness, with obstacles to forest restoration, such as infrastructure development and high human land use. The resulting map shows areas with higher potential and lower obstacles, and thus where forest restoration could be most effective and have the most positive impacts. This could include contributing to SDGs such as SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land).

This type of analysis can identify where agroforestry actions are feasible to guide implementation of Côte d’Ivoire’s National REDD+ Strategy, promoting the use of agroforestry to strengthen agricultural systems’ resilience to climate change, and to diversify incomes for farmers. There is also an opportunity to align REDD+ and private sector cocoa initiatives, with the potential to create more incentives for smallholder farmers and contribute to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), among others.

Meanwhile in Viet Nam, lessons from the National REDD+ Programme are informing the development of a deforestation-free jurisdiction in the Central Highlands. This region is at the forefront of efforts to conserve natural forests and other biodiversity, while sustaining production of high-value crops like coffee. Both nationally and locally, partners are seeking to promote sustainable land management and pilot a deforestation-free approach in the region in support of SDGs 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

These individual examples give us just a snapshot of how retaining, restoring and sustainably managing our forests can help achieve a wide variety of SDGs and bring a range of benefits for people and for nature. As this year’s International Day of Forests slogan put it, our forests are too precious to lose.

It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

There is overwhelming evidence that the Asia-Pacific region needs to accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and substantially reverse current negative trends, especially those which are depleting and degrading its environmental resources, according to a new report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020 draws attention to the region’s poor performance on most of the measurable environmental targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example, the share of renewable energy has dropped to 16 per cent, one of the lowest rates globally. The region also emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas - a number which has doubled since 2000. 35 per cent of countries continue to lose their forests.

“Our analysis finds that the Asia-Pacific region has struggled the most with two Goals: advancing responsible consumption and production, and climate action. In fact, the region is not even moving in the right direction,” underscored United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.

“These findings sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies,” added Ms. Alisjahbana.

On a positive note, many countries are moving decisively and showing remarkable progress in improving the quality of education (Goal 4) and providing access to affordable and clean energy (Goal 7). The Report suggests that achieving these two Goals is well within reach. The region is also making good progress on targets related to economic growth. Real GDP per capita growth in the Asia-Pacific was more than double the world average in 2017, and at the same time, at least 18 countries in the region are experiencing less income inequality.

Yet, to grow more sustainably and equitably, the current economic progress of the region must be coupled with human well-being and a healthy environment. Progress has been far too slow in areas such as gender equality (Goal 5) and building sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). ESCAP warns that the region remains unlikely to meet any of the 17 SDGs by 2030 without concerted and extra efforts from all stakeholders.

Progress has also been uneven across the five Asia-Pacific subregions, most especially in reducing inequalities (Goal 10), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), and peace, justice and strong institutions (Goal 16). A positive example of collective progress across all five subregions however is on access to electricity, where steady improvement is noticeable, particularly in rural areas.

Data availability for the SDG indicators has substantially increased over the past few years in Asia and the Pacific, from 25 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent in 2020. But data is still lacking on over half of the SDG indicators, especially those Goals with slow progress. This, according to ESCAP, highlights the urgent need to strengthen the policy-data nexus in the region.

A flagship annual publication produced by ESCAP, in partnership with five other UN agencies, the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report uses the latest data for global SDG indicators to determine where additional effort is needed in the region and where momentum for future progress is building.

THE Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation says it has sources of data showing that Fiji has progressed in terms of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5.

SDG 5 aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women in both the public and private spheres.

This was highlighted by the ministry’s permanent secretary Jennifer Poole in response to a question raised by committee member and Opposition MP Prof Biman Prasad during the ministry’s submission to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence yesterday.

Prof Prasad questioned the ministry whether or not they had the relevant data to measure Fiji’s progress in achieving the SDGs.

Ms Poole said the ministry supported evidence-based research and evidence-based informing policy.

“So currently we are launching a policy, it’s already in process and we are recruiting a team now to do the national gender assessment,” she said.

“This would bring the data that we need as a baseline and also to give us status of women in the country and inform us of our progress about the SDGs.

“We have got our sources of data which are showing progress towards SDG 5 and that was reported in the Beijing Platform for Action +25 report and the summary of the report was tabled during my last meeting here.”

She said this report would soon be presented to Parliament.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

The Arab region’s 2020 Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD) has been postponed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

74,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/935556-sdg-5-tanzania-battles-for-gender-equality-after-victory-against-child-marriage,"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Devdiscourse,SDG 5: Tanzania battles for gender equality after victory against child marriage,"It is said that the world average of women top executives is 8 percent with Thailand leading the position (having the highest proportion of female CEOs over the planet). The rate of women at the top in Tanzania make up 8 percent of the country's CEOs. It may take some more years for the east African country to keep women in high-level management positions equally during the global peak hours when employers and organizations are trying to crush the deeply-rooted patriarchal traditions.

Employment and salaries lower for women than men

Females in Tanzania form a larger share of the working age population. Women account for 52 percent of the working age population (15 years and over), but labour force participation rate is higher among males (89.4 percent) than among females (84.2 percent). The gender gap in labour force participation increases with rising education level. Among women, the unemployment rates are higher than those of men in all areas, particularly in the capital Dar es Salaam. Albeit unemployment is comparable among men and women, the difference is higher in rural areas compared to urban areas as the majority of women there are unemployed.

In Tanzania, men are more likely to be employed in formal sectors including government service than women. The country has a big gender gap in terms of monthly income between men and women. Even in agriculture, women's monthly income is almost half in comparison to men. Subsistence farming is a source of livelihood for more than 80 percent women, although only 27 percent own land. Unfortunately, women still face discrimination in the labour market in terms of wages, promotions and legal protections followed by confronting harassment in the workplace.

According to the Tanzania Human Rights Report 2017 (by the US Department of State), women have the same status as men under labour law on the mainland. The report states that gender-based discrimination in terms of wages, promotions, and legal protections in employment continues to occur in the private sector (based on the Trade Union Congress of Tanzania). The report also states that women often are employed for low pay and in hazardous jobs, and they report high levels of bullying, threats and sexual harassment.

Petition at Parliament for men to pay 'salary' to their wives

Maybe as a consequential outcome of this kind of reasons, the Regional Commissioner of Tanzania's Dar es Salaam city, Paul Makonda has recently announced his intention to petition at the Parliament to introduce a bill. He does not want women to be frustrated due to lack of money.

Paul Makonda is set to petition at the Parliament for introducing a bill that seeks to have 40 percent of men's monthly salary deducted and credited to their wives' bank accounts. According to the local media, he made the pledge of giving justice to the women in Kinondoni, Dar es Salaam during the International Women's Day celebration.

""I will petition the National Assembly to introduce a law that will see 40 percent of salaries of men in formal employment deducted and credited to the bank accounts of their spouses who are housewives,"" he said.

According to him, there is a requirement for stringent law that compel men to accept that their wives would be the sole custodians of their property if they (men) die before their spouses. The 38-year-old Regional Commissioner is set to resolve the problems of widows camping at his office seeking intervention after losing their rights upon demise of their husbands. For good measure, he has already introduced a hotline toll-free number, which he said, 'depressed' women could use to seek assistance from his office.

Plight of single mothers likely to be partially solved

The Regional Commissioner has also suggested single mothers to avoid instilling the sense of hostility in their children's minds on their deadbeat fathers. He said this would stop deceitful married men from sexually preying on unsuspecting single women. ""You will find a single mum talking so negatively about her deadbeat ex-partner. One thing that woman should know is that the child wasn't there when she and her partner first met,"" he said.

""It is therefore wise to face your struggles alone, and don't involve the children. Your toxic talk could have a near-permanent impact on the children, especially your girls who shun getting into heterosexual relationships because – based on what their mothers told them – they (girls) might think that all men are heartbreakers,"" the Regional Commissioner, who is well-known for giving efforts to empower women, opined.

Single mothers in rural Tanzania confront typical struggles due to lack of education and awareness. They are not aware properly of their rights and values as human beings. Many women believe that once they become pregnant and their men abandon them, they lose their dignity totally. The situation is worse in some communities where women are stigmatized for being single mothers. However, under the guidance of NGOs, the single mothers thrive to become entrepreneurs so that they are able to take care of their children.

Government's active roles

The government of Tanzania has adopted multiple policies that advance gender equality and youth inclusion in a supportive enabling milieu. One of these is the recent victory against child marriage by making alteration in the marriage act that had been a real cause of celebration for country's boys and girls. Last year, the high court ruled the previous provisions unconstitutional and raised the minimum age of marriage to be 18 years. Still there are many things need to be done at the government level to ensure women are not deceived, exploited and spend their lives in poverty.

The rate of secondary school enrolment in Tanzania is as low as 31 percent, whereas girls' percentage is even lower. An estimated 5.1 million children aged 7 to 17 don't attend school. The percentage for girls enrolment is lower mainly due to physical transportation to and from school. World Bank's data shows less than one-third of all girls in the country are graduate. The government jointly needs to work with national and international bodies, NGOs, social workers etc. to promote empowerment of all women and girls and make secondary education mandatory for all girls. The duty of the government is to ensure that the country is able to achieve the United Nations-set Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5 – achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) by 2030.

Negotiations on the framework are expected to culminate at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China, in October 2020.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Strategic Plan 2011-2020, which lays out the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, is rapidly approaching its 2020 expiration date. As a result, the Open-ended Intersessional Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was developed and has been tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the framework.

As the Earth Negotiations Bulletin analysis of the meeting indicates, the charge to “develop an all-encompassing framework that includes, in addition to addressing direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss and rapid species extinction, a plethora of considerations, such as ecosystem health, nature’s contributions to people, human health, socio-economic concerns, trade concerns, human rights considerations, new technologies, indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs), gender issues, intergenerational concerns, and education, among others, is by definition an extremely daunting task.”

The first meeting of the Working Group, which took place on 27-30 August 2019, at the UN Office at Nairobi, Kenya, agreed that the Co-Chairs and the CBD Bureau would develop a zero draft text on the global biodiversity framework; the zero draft was released in January 2020.

The second meeting of the Working Group took place from 24-29 February 2020, at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) in Rome, Italy. On the opening day participants were challenged to focus on implementation, raise ambition in goals and targets, provide financial and other means of implementation, and develop mechanisms to hold each other accountable and review progress. In his opening remarks to the Working Group, Hamdallah Zedan, Egypt’s Ministry of Environment, speaking on behalf of President of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 14), also underlined the need for the global biodiversity framework to provide a detailed plan of action to reduce biodiversity loss, which he stressed is taking place at an alarming rate and requires urgent response.

Working Group participants commented on the zero draft of the framework. At the conclusion of the meeting, participants:

invited the 24th meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical, and Technological Advice (SBSTTA 24) to provide elements for the development of the global biodiversity framework for consideration by the third Working Group meeting, which is scheduled to take place in July;

invited SBSTTA to provide a scientific and technical review of updated goals and targets, and related indicators and baselines;

requested the Working Group Co-Chairs and the Secretariat to prepare a document, updating the elements of the draft framework that were reviewed during the second meeting of the Working Group;

requested the Secretariat to provide scientific and technical information to support SBSTTA’s review, including an analysis of linkages with the SDGs; and

requested the Working Group Co-Chairs and the Secretariat to prepare a first draft of the global biodiversity framework.

The third meeting of the Working Group is tentatively scheduled to take place from 27-31 July 2020, in Cali, Colombia.

76,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/gcf-prepares-to-deliver-ambition-for-cop-26/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,GCF Prepares to Deliver Ambition for COP 26,"2020 marks an important year for climate finance and the beginning of a critical decade for climate ambition. Starting off its first meeting of the year, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board met from 10-12 March, in Geneva, Switzerland, to address pertinent agenda items. The Board considered an updated workplan for the next three years, the effectiveness of its committees, and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the simplified approval process (SAP).

Board members agreed on measures to increase the GCF’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals, and also discussed budgetary issues such as progress on ‘stuck’ projects and what lessons can be learned from the pilot programme on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+. This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

Progress on the GCF’s Work Program 2020-2030

As was decided at the previous Board meeting, the Co-Chairs presented a draft of the updated workplan of the Board for 2020–2023, including a schedule for a list of items the Board will consider in 2020. The Board considered a draft decision to adopt the updated workplan, which built on previous discussions that were held at an informal meeting from 5-7 February 2020, in Monrovia, Liberia.

Board members requested prioritizing: by June 2020, the approval of key policies related to the investment framework, including the incremental and full cost methodology, the policy on ‘concessionality’ and the mapping on eligibility and selection criteria; and by 2021, the approval of guidelines on the Board decisions without a Board meeting.

In informal consultations, views diverged on: strategic objectives and allocations; shifting financial flows; project prioritization; diversifying instruments; accreditation prioritization; and efficient process management and delegation. The Board advanced convergence of views on diversifying instruments and accreditation prioritization, but concluded with the need to further discuss the workplan at its June session.

The Board also took note of actions to be undertaken in 2020 in response to the guidance received from parties during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) in 2019.

Working towards enhancing the effectiveness of committees

The status of the review of the effectiveness of committees was also highlighted as critical to be addressed as soon as possible under the GCF’s work plan. A previous report, which was distributed on a limited basis, suggested that there was scope to improve transparency by reviewing record keeping and reporting to the Board, and enhance effectiveness by reviewing structures of committees as well as the way committees operate and coordinate.

The Board took note of the ‘Final report of the review of the effectiveness of committees and groups established by the Board’ and of the ‘General Guidelines for Committees and Panels,’ and requested the Co-Chairs to consultant with members and Committees and present updated guidelines by its next June session.

Improving the GCF’s Simplified Approval Process

The Board also considered the review of the simplified approval process pilot scheme, which assesses the results achieved by the simplified approval process (SAP) to date, and includes recommendations for streamlining and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAP. The review found the following:

The SAP is a valuable funding modality that can lead to expeditious approval of low-risk projects that can better address the urgent climate adaptation needs of GCF priority countries, such as the African States, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small islands developing States (SIDS);

The SAP pipeline has grown by an average of 10.5% every month and represented 22% of all submission in the GCF pipeline, demonstrating a strong demand for SAP, especially from direct access entities (DAEs) which compose the majority of pipeline submissions; and

Despite the fact that SAP projects are small in terms of GCF finance and have low risks, the SAP is perceived similar to the regular proposal approval process even if they involve funding proposals that imply higher risks and require much larger amounts of GCF finance.

The review’s main recommendations include:

expand to activities that imply limited environmental and social risks;

speed up the approval cycle of such projects and programmes with ‘In between Board Meeting’ approvals;

introduce delegated authority to the Secretariat for the approval of SAP projects and programmes that imply minimal to no environmental and social risks;

use dedicated independent expert consultants in lieu of the independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP);

increase the Secretariat’s capacity for technical reviews of a larger number of SAP proposals using external technical reviewers;

strengthen technical support to DAEs with closer alignment to Project Preparation Facility and Readiness activities; and

keep expanding the knowledge products on SAP, which build the capacity of accredited entities and national designated authority in SAP project design/development.

Some members signaled their: opposition to delegating authority or functions of the ITAP to external consultants; concern over the unbalanced geographically distribution of projects in the SAP pipeline; and opposition to introducing any notion of “GCF priority countries.”

Observers called for ensuring that any ‘In between Board Meeting’ approval process allows for stakeholder input, and opposed the use of the SAP to facilitate private sector involvement as well as an opening up of the SAP for any projects outside of activities with minimal or no adverse environmental or social risks or impacts. The Board requested the Secretariat to further develop the SAP for Board consideration by its next meeting.

Increasing ITAP’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals

As ITAP is one of the areas identified in the SAP review in which efficiency could be increased both under the SAP and the regular GCF proposal approval process, the Board considered an option to enhance the ITAP by increasing its members to ensure that more projects will be brought before the Board for approval.

GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec clarified, among others, that the GCF’s key challenges include an increased need for project review, with an expected increase in the number of projects per year based on the level of replenishment. He said that 52 projects are currently undergoing review and noted that the GCF is on track to submit 21 projects to ITAP for the Board’s next meeting. He added that a larger number is expected for the Board’s subsequent meeting, in part to deliver on the ambition for UNFCCC COP 26.

During discussions, members raised procedural questions and advocated establishing a roster of experts. Observers stressed the importance to engage in more detail with in-country project relevant stakeholders and affected people. The Board decided to, inter alia:

re-appoint three members of the ITAP for a 1.5- year term;

increase the size of the ITAP from six to ten members by the end of 2020;

approve an additional administrative budget for the Board for the year 2020 in the amount of USD 338,800, to cover the additional four members of ITAP, the administrative support consultant, and the operationalization of the roster of experts; and

request the Secretariat, in consultation with the Investment Committee and the ITAP, to propose updates to the operational modalities of ITAP to accommodate the increased workload by the next Board meeting.

Status of the GCF’s financial resources

The GCF saw USD 10.3 billion in contributions during the fund’s initial resource mobilization which lasted from 2015-2018, and USD 9.8 billion for the GCF’s 2020-2023 replenishment, or first replenishment (GCF-1), with a combined total of USD 8.3 billion received so far. At its March meeting, the Board took note of the Status of GCF resources, pipelines and portfolio performance.

The GCF resource status shows that the total of GCF funding commitments amounts to USD 6.5 billion, which is composed of: USD 5.4 billion under approved projects; USD 0.3 billion under Readiness and Project Preparation Facilities; and, taking other factors into account, a remaining commitment authority of USD 1.8 billion. Noteworthy, USD 13.9 billion of co-financing mobilized, in addition to the 5.4 billion GCF financing, serve the approved projects and activities in 105 countries.

The largest portion of GCF Funding, amounting to USD 2.2 billion, is allocated to 37 countries in the African Region. This geographical distribution is followed by: USD 1.9 billion allocated to 34 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and USD 1.1 billion allocated to 27 countries from Latin and Caribbean Region. About USD 1.4 billion has been committed to 23 LDCs and USD 0.8 billion to SIDS.

The GCF portfolio of approved projects is expected to abate a total of 1.6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (GHG) in carbon dioxide equivalent and reach 348 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries, based on the estimations of accredited entities. Since November 2015, the Board approved 124 funding proposals, with 74 projects under implementation and 61 projects receiving funds. In total, the approved projects, including co-financing, amount to USD 20.6 billion.

By the start of the year the GCF Funding pipeline showed 79 public and private sector funding proposals, which request a total GCF funding of USD 3.4 billion to support projects and programmes totaling USD 11.8 billion, when taking co-financing into account.

During discussions, members raised concerns about projects that are not progressing over long periods of time, suggesting consideration to restructure such projects and implement early filters as remedy measures. The Secretariat informed that it was developing a stronger portfolio performance management system to identify early warning and project performance and reported that seven projects worth USD 500 million “were stuck for two years” but are now expected to move towards implementation by mid-2020.

Progress on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD+

Regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the Board took note of the Secretariat’s analysis of the experience with, and the progress made towards, achieving the objectives of the pilot programme for REDD-plus results-based payments. Findings include:

a positive response from REDD+ countries, and that the numbers of countries submitting REDD+ results to the UNFCCC increased from three to 12 in the last two years;

procedures approved by the Board are fully functional, and that technical capacities were enhanced in ITAP with UNFCCC experts; and

the pilot is relevant to the REDD+ results-based payments finance landscape, given that the GCF has provided 30% out of the global volume of this finance and a large interest to continue and to explore options, including involving the private sector to leverage additional finance for the pilot programme.

So far four projects in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and Paraguay for USD 228.63 million have been approved, with six projects in the pipeline from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Nine more are expected by the end of the pilot programme, seven from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and three from the Asian region, while the funds are likely to be exhausted by 2021 and prior to the end of the pilot programme in 2022.

Recommendations from the analysis include, given the complexity of REDD+ elements, to further discuss and analyze alternatives for the continuation of the implementation of REDD+ results-based payments, including:

analyzing market and non-market contexts, the role of the private sector, complementarity with other multi- and bilateral funding arrangements, and technical and procedural matters; and

considering options such as to extend the pilot programme, a second pilot programme with some adjustments, a permanent funding window, and a grandparenting period.

Noting diverging views on REDD+ in general, some members highlighted that ensuring environmental integrity is a key issue to take into account when addressing the future for the pilot programme. Members also: voiced their reservations about considering a permanent funding window; supported consideration of the role of private actors; and cautioned against prejudging ongoing negotiations under Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches). Raising concerns about the four funding proposals already adopted, Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples: called for revisions of the pilot programme; opposed the use of reference levels that lower ambition; raised questions about carbon storage permanence and verification of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and stressed the need to avoid double counting.

Board approves USD 169.7 million in GCF funding for six projects and programmes

The GCF Board approved six funding proposals amounting to USD 169.7 million in GCF funding that will support projects and programmes with a total value of USD 618.7 million. The majority of the funding, or 74%, is allocated for adaptation projects, and 26% for mitigation projects. The expected impact potential is to abate a total of 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) of GHGs and reach 4.8 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries. Specifically, the GCF approved finance to support four public-sector projects in the following countries:

Viet Nam, with a USD 30.2 million GCF grant for a USD 156.3 million adaptation project which aims to empower vulnerable smallholders by securing water provision, supporting farmers to adopt climate-resilient agriculture, and strengthening access to agro-climate information, credit and markets.

Zimbabwe, with a USD 26.6 million GCF grant for a USD 47.8million adaptation project which seeks to address climate impacts and build the resilience of smallholder farmers in three semi-arid agroecological regions of southern Zimbabwe.

Sri Lanka, with a USD 39.8 million GCF grant for a USD 49 million adaptation project which aims to strengthen the capacity of smallholder subsistence farmers to address climate-induced irrigation and drinking water shortages by improving the resilience of farm- and land-management practices, and by climate proofing ecosystems.

Cuba, with a USD 38.3 million GCF grant for a USD 119.9 million cross-cutting project which seeks to increase the climate resilience of agricultural production and ensure food security through improved ecosystem services from agroforestry, silvopastoral systems, reforestation and assisted natural forest regeneration in seven municipalities vulnerable to climate change.

The Board also approved two private sector funding proposals for climate action in the following countries:

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are benefiting from GCF funding of USD 25 million in equity for a USD 200 million mitigation programme, titled ‘Arbaro Fund – Sustainable Forestry Fund.’ It will invest in sustainable plantation forestry projects with adaptation co-benefits to increase carbon sinks by producing wood in a sustainable manner and conserving natural forests, whilst contributing to reduction of illegal logging.

Haiti, with a USD 1.5 million GCF grant and a USD 8.4 million loan for a USD 45.7 million cross-cutting project. The project aims to: develop 22 community-scale solar plus battery storage micro-grids in communities where currently no grid power exists; provide affordable and reliable access to modern energy services in communities; and build capacity for microgrid deployment and operation.

The Board further:

The outline, which was discussed throughout the week-long meeting and was the subject of contact group discussions on the penultimate evening and last day of IPCC-52, contains a stage-setting introduction and three sections: Current Status and Trends; Long-term Climate and Development Futures; and Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report from the meeting indicates that “some of the more contentious issues that came up during the discussions on the outline related to the carbon budget, timeframes, just transition, and extreme events and loss and damage, among others.”

In addition, delegates at the meeting, which took place from 24-28 February 2020, in Paris, France, discussed the organization of future work of the IPCC in light of the Global Stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement, on which views diverged over a range of options regarding possible alignment of IPCC and GST cycles. Some questioned the need for discussing an alignment at this point, while others suggested other ways of promoting timely inputs to the GST.

The briefing was hosted by the UK, which will be assuming the COP 26 presidency in partnership with Italy.



COP 26 is scheduled to convene from 9-20 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK.

In his remarks on 6 March 2020, Guterres said limiting warming to 1.5°C requires that strategies be drawn up during 2020 in order to achieve emission reductions of 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The largest emitters must develop strategies to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Guterres said.

He highlighted four priorities for COP 26:

New nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that show increased ambition, and set clear targets for 2025 or 2030 to keep temperature rise to 1.5°C;

Ensuring that all countries, particularly the largest emitters, get on board to develop strategies to reach net‑zero emissions by 2050;

Adopting a robust package of programmes, projects, and initiatives to help adapt to climate disruption and build resilience against future impacts; and

Mobilization by developed countries of USD 100 billion per year by 2020 through both public and private investments.

Guterres said his Special Envoy on Climate Action and Climate Finance, Mark Carney, will engage with finance leaders on carbon neutrality, carbon pricing, climate risk disclosure, scaling up green financial instruments, embedding climate into economic and financial priorities, and enhancing NDCs. He noted the need to transform how the financial sector works, including increased investments in renewables and green technologies and ending fossil fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon, and halting the construction of new coal power plants. He urged “bottom up” ambition that depends on all partners and actors, including cities, the private sector, finance institutions, the philanthropic community, and civil society committing to meaningful climate action.

Finally, the Secretary-General acknowledged increased difficulties in the lead-up to COP 26 due to the postponement of many meetings as a result of the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak.

Incoming COP 26 President Alok Sharma, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK, said the upcoming COP is an opportunity to accelerate a fair and inclusive transition, and to agree on a package to advance the Paris Agreement. Sharma highlighted a number of areas requiring particular attention, namely:

Adaptation and resilience, and access to adaptation finance;

Safeguarding ecosystems, protecting natural habitats, environmental regulation around supply chains, channeling finance to invest in nature, and ensuring global climate and biodiversity processes complement and support each other;

Opportunities of cheaper renewables and storage, investing in innovation to help the transition to clean energy, and helping developing countries leapfrog to cleaner technologies;

Accelerating the transition to zero carbon road transport by bringing forward the date when zero emission vehicles will be cheaper and cleaner; and

Unleashing finance to power the shift to a zero-carbon economy, with USD 7 trillion needed up to 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.

Sharma also pointed to the launch of the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda, in which private finance is increasingly focused on the opportunities and risks of transitioning to a decarbonized economy, and committed to climate-related financial disclosure.

Mariangela Zappia, Permanent Representative of Italy, reiterated calls to increase ambition by: enhancing NDCs and setting clear timelines for achieving climate neutrality; increasing capacity to deal with the consequences of climate change, especially for the most vulnerable; and promoting a shift towards financial strategies and investments consistent with the Paris Agreement, among both public and private decision-makers.

Zappia said that in addition to co-hosting the Pre-COP in October 2020 in Milan, Italy, the government also will convene Youth4Climate2020 from 28-30 September, as well as a high-level ministerial event on environmental and climate challenges in Africa, taking place from 20-21 October, in Rome.

Belize, speaking for the small island developing States (SIDS), lamented that the UNFCCC process has become clouded with mistrust and disunity, and said ambitious NDCs are necessary to reverse this trend. Stressing environmental integrity, she said that new rules and guidance on markets must deliver real emission reductions, go beyond the narrative of offsetting, and not just be a “grandiose accounting scheme.” She also highlighted the need for: a robust transparency mechanism; long-term adaptation for SIDS, which is intrinsically linked to the new finance goal; and addressing governance of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) prior to COP 26. She said Belize will host an Ambition Forum from 20-21 April 2020.

France stressed that COP 26 must demonstrate increased ambition in NDCs and long-term strategies (LTS), and said major emitters must commit to a zero-emissions trajectory. In addition, France supported putting nature at the center of COP 26, and underlined: meeting financial commitments to ensure a just transition for all; reaffirming confidence in the multilateral system; and solidarity with the most vulnerable countries.

The EU urged engaging as much as possible before COP 26 to avoid “unnecessary combustion in Glasgow.” He highlighted EU efforts, including a climate law proposal that will enshrine in binding legislation the 2050 climate neutrality target, and initiatives on industrial policy, biodiversity strategy, and a strategy for sustainable food systems.

Once the regulations are concluded, they will govern future activities in the Area. Negotiators are striving to ensure the regulations provide environmental protection while balancing stakeholders’ interests.

During the ISA-26 talks, which took place from 17-21 February 2020, in Kingston, Jamaica, delegates also engaged in discussions over new proposals on regional environmental management plans (REMPs), which ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge described as “one of the most important work streams of the ISA over the last two years.” Furthermore, they discussed the financial model for mineral exploitation in the Area, agreeing to convene a fourth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) to further this work.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the meeting notes that delegates were reminded that the self-imposed deadline for completing the exploitation regulations is 2020, which has put the ISA Council “under pressure to agree on a mining code. Further, while the commercial viability of exploitation of minerals from the deep sea depends on many factors, from technology to mineral prices, contractors and sponsoring states are eager for the clarity that a regulatory code would provide.” At the same time, some members and observers have stressed the need for marine scientific research and adequate stakeholder engagement, to ensure environmental protection and conservation.

It followed on the heels of the 33rd African Union (AU) Summit, which focused on the 2020 theme, ‘Silencing the Guns: Creating conducive conditions for Africa’s Development.’

Addressing the overarching theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ the sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD 2020), was also the first regional consultation to take place under the UN@75 reform process. On the margins of the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General (UNDSG) Amina Mohammed convened several consultations with regional stakeholders, including UN and AU institutions, and youth, to elicit perspectives from on the ongoing UN reform process.

ARFSD 2020 took place from 24-27 February 2020, in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. It was co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the AU Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN system. It brought together nearly 3,000 delegates in plenary and parallel sessions over the four days, holding more than 60 preparatory and side events.

The Regional Forum assessed Africa’s progress on all 17 SDGs, clustered around the “five Ps” of the 2030 Agenda: people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnerships. Drawing on regional data sources – including the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2020, and the inaugural AU Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063 – there was a convergence of evidence that, despite some pockets of progress, the region is off track on both global and regional goals.

Forum participants engaged in in-depth discussion of key findings and lessons from a selection of VNRs currently being conducted by 17 African countries for presentation at the HLPF in July 2020, as well as emerging lessons from voluntary local reviews (VLRs), which featured for the first time at the Forum. A recurring theme in the discussions was the need to address weak national and local capacity in accessing and using quality and relevant data. Underscoring the importance of building VNRs on evidence-based local reviews, the Forum proposed developing a template to support country reporting. Accelerators for delivering a transformed and prosperous Africa, including through leveraging science, technology and innovation (STI), and strengthening partnerships with the UN Development System, major groups, youth, and other stakeholders were also highlighted.

The Forum adopted a ministerial declaration, titled, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ as well as an outcome summary report and key messages containing Africa’s priorities and policy measures to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

Addressing the negative impact of the climate crisis, Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), cited estimates that some countries are spending the equivalent of 2-3% of their GDP on unplanned responses to weather and climate impacts. Touching on repercussions for the water, energy, conflict, food security, and hydropower production sectors, she highlighted efforts underway to craft a common regional position on this issue for the 2020 UN Climate Conference.

During the 33rd AU Summit, which took place from 8-9 February, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the AU-UN strategic partnership is growing “ever stronger and more dynamic,” and highlighted interlinkages between the ‘Silencing the Guns’ initiative with targets on human rights, gender equality, climate change, and sustainable development. With an estimated tripling of armed conflicts over the past decade, despite implementation of a peace and security roadmap, the discussions underscored the importance of good governance, and building more inclusive societies.

Incoming AU Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined regional priorities to achieve the Agenda 2063, including, supporting regional integration, industrialization, and trade and investment, and strengthening women’s economic empowerment, in line with the launch of the AU Decade of Financial Inclusion for Women. The Summit adopted enhanced commitments towards this end, including plans to allocate 25% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, and the launch of the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF), which aims to provide capital to both first time and experienced fund managers, to invest in majority female-owned businesses.

The UNECE Dashboard for SDGs was launched on 13 March 2020, ahead of UNECE’s Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFSD will only convene for a half-day, online meeting on 19 March 2020.

Data disaggregation remains a major gap in monitoring the SDGs.

The Dashboard draws on data from the UN Global SDG Database. The 80 indicators included in the dashboard are listed at the indicator menu page.

The Dashboard allows users to:

See “snapshots” by country, and compare countries;

View differences between women and men;

Create graphs and maps; and

Access definitions and explanations.

Users can download full datasets for more in-depth analysis.

Announcing the launch of the Dashboard, UNECE notes that a major gap in monitoring the SDGs is data disaggregation. Although the 2030 Agenda calls for examining indicators for specific population groups – broken up by sex, age, ethnicity, as well as migratory, disability and/or indigenous status – data collection still must be significantly increased to make this possible. UNECE reports that “to date, the only disaggregation offered in the UNECE dashboard is by sex, where possible with the currently-available data.”

UNECE adds that it is working to improve measurement in areas of the SDGs that are particularly hard to measure, including disaggregated poverty measurement, migration statistics, environmental statistics and indicators, climate change-related statistics, and statistics on children and youth.

In this environment, the 17 United Nations



Beyond the specific SDG targets, their collective value is embedded in the recognition that societal challenges are transnational, require access to resources (human and capital) beyond the capability or capacity of individual countries and institutions and hence require multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams. In an age of neo-nationalism, the SDGs highlight the necessity of multilateralism.



Ranking SDGs



Rankings often portray themselves as promoters of greater public information and disclosure. But too often they measure benefits gained from accumulated public and-or private wealth and investment over decades, if not centuries. Their choice of indicators cherishes the benefits of attracting high achieving/high socio-economic students who graduate on time and go on to have successful careers.



Excellence is measured in terms of research and reputational achievements of individual universities rather than as a collective contribution to the public good.



So, we should give some credit to the



THE launched its SDG ranking in 2019. Of the almost 20,000 higher education institutions worldwide, according to the



The methodology assesses activity against: research, stewardship, outreach and teaching. With the exception of data from Elsevier, universities submit evidence, examples and data against at least four of the SDGs. Research accounts for 27% of each SDG against which data is submitted.



THE evaluates each submission. The overall score is calculated on the basis of the three best SDG scores, plus performance against SDG 17.



Monetisation of university data



Not only is gathering the material for submission a lot of work, but it is unlikely that THE can control or validate the accuracy and comparability of the information provided by the universities. Anyone with experience of evaluating large scale projects will understand the magnitude of the work involved and the necessary integrity and transparency of the process.



THE carries out the evaluation behind closed doors. The submissions provide a lucrative treasure trove of institutional data which remains behind a paywall. This exposes one of the biggest developments of recent years – the monetisation of university data by commercial rankings and publishing organisations.



There is little evidence that these rankings – or their predecessors – have had any meaningful impact on improving quality, which is a context-dependent, multi-dimensional concept. Rising in the rankings is not equivalent to improving quality, which is why we are beginning to see reaction in the Netherlands and China against using citations as a meaningful measure of academic performance.



In fact, it is very possible to rise in the rankings without making any significant contribution to the public good.



So what actions might work?



Are there better and more meaningful and sustainable alternative ways to embed the SDGs?



Having a good quality assurance system which includes university commitment to the public good in all its dimensions: civic, social, economic, cultural and intellectual – would be a good place to start.



The



Many governments are promoting a systems approach which aims to reframe the social contract around the role and responsibilities of higher education institutions, working collaboratively with other providers and social partners, rather than promoting atomised institutions.



These instruments are less concerned with rankings and more with public responsibility. Performance agreements and compacts, targeted funding and performance-based funding aim to balance individual institutional and collective values and objectives of/for society.



International organisations have a role to play. U-Multirank has the potential to play a bigger role because it is a European Union initiative with the ‘authority’ of member states. The World Bank benchmarking approach enables universities to choose indicators that are most meaningful to them. UNESCO, alongside OECD and-or the World Bank, might consider a joint initiative.



Assessing the social responsibility of rankings



There is no doubt colleges and universities should take their responsibilities to society and the ‘public good’ extremely seriously and be assessed accordingly. But shouldn’t rankings be assessed against the same objectives – given that their effect has been to promote elitism and undermine equity and diversity?



Despite their calls for greater transparency and accountability, their methodologies display very little evidence of either. Universities provide bundles of data free to non-transparent processes and held behind paywalls. It’s no longer good enough to only talk about universities’ corporate social responsibility. Isn’t it time we talked about the corporate social responsibility of the ranking organisations themselves?



Ellen Hazelkorn is joint managing partner, BH Associates education consultants, and professor emerita, Technological University Dublin, Ireland. This piece is based on her contribution to the session: “Rankings and SDGs: Should HEIs be ranked for their SDG performance?”, Second GUNi (Global University Network for Innovation) International Conference on Sustainable Development Goals: Higher Education and Science Take Action, 5 March 2020. In an era of post-truth and fake news, one of the most prominent issues of public and political focus today is the extent to which universities contribute to the public good. In many countries, concerns about student learning and employability, and growing disparities in wealth and opportunity, have spurred a deep sense of grievance and decline in public trust. As questions about universities’ contribution to the public good are raised, rankings are also focusing on societal impact.In this environment, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become a very public symbol and policy instrument. They are used by students and academics, by universities and countries and by research and other agencies to demonstrate, measure and assess commitment to global societal challenges.Beyond the specific SDG targets, their collective value is embedded in the recognition that societal challenges are transnational, require access to resources (human and capital) beyond the capability or capacity of individual countries and institutions and hence require multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams.

It is very likely other quality assurance and accreditation agencies will follow suit.Many governments are promoting a systems approach which aims to reframe the social contract around the role and responsibilities of higher education institutions, working collaboratively with other providers and social partners, rather than promoting atomised institutions.These instruments are less concerned with rankings and more with public responsibility. Performance agreements and compacts, targeted funding and performance-based funding aim to balance individual institutional and collective values and objectives of/for society.International organisations have a role to play. U-Multirank has the potential to play a bigger role because it is a European Union initiative with the ‘authority’ of member states. The World Bank benchmarking approach enables universities to choose indicators that are most meaningful to them. UNESCO, alongside OECD and-or the World Bank, might consider a joint initiative.There is no doubt colleges and universities should take their responsibilities to society and the ‘public good’ extremely seriously and be assessed accordingly. But shouldn’t rankings be assessed against the same objectives – given that their effect has been to promote elitism and undermine equity and diversity?Despite their calls for greater transparency and accountability, their methodologies display very little evidence of either. Universities provide bundles of data free to non-transparent processes and held behind paywalls. It’s no longer good enough to only talk about universities’ corporate social responsibility. Isn’t it time we talked about the corporate social responsibility of the ranking organisations themselves? Follow University World News on Facebook

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite implementation challenges, there is evidence of “significant progress” in several areas, including waste management.

The ‘Tuvalu Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026’ is the main national policy framework to guide the management of waste in the country with the vision of having “A Cleaner and Healthier Tuvalu for today and future generations.”

The Policy and Action Plan acknowledges that its development is a “timely response to the significant changes happening in the waste sector in the Pacific Region and globally.” These changes include an increase in waste generated on the islands that has come about due to a proliferation of consumption of “more wasteful imported products,” according to the Plan. Excess waste presents a significant challenge, considering the “extremely limited land mass” of atoll countries such as Tuvalu.

The Policy and Action Plan, endorsed by the Government of Tuvalu in 2016, consists of six goals:

Strengthened institutional systems to address gaps in waste management;

The stakeholders fully understand the merits of proper waste management and co-share the responsibility of managing waste;

Establish strong public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the delivery of waste services;

Delivered waste services follow best practice and are cost-effective;

Enhanced capacity of waste practitioners; and

Waste activity outcomes are reported and disseminated to relevant stakeholders.

The last goal of the Policy and Action Plan is achieved, in part, through the conduct of annual reviews of the implementation status of the Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan. Since 2016, two annual reviews have been conducted. The latest one was released in May 2019, and covers the period from January 2018 to March 2019.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite challenges to implementation of the Waste Policy and Action Plan, there is evidence of “significant progress” especially on goals two, three, and five due to the Department of Waste Management elevating these to the national level with the support of key stakeholders. The report also outlines progress on achieving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as: review existing waste-related legislation and merge into one Act; develop specific regulations to support strict enforcement of the new waste legislation; allocate reasonable budget for waste services; implement public awareness programmes involving communities and schools in all waste service areas in the Tuvaluan language; reduce occupational and public health and safety incidents by 50%; 100% coverage of collection in the main island and at least 80% coverage of collection in the outer islands; and exploration and participation in information exchange programmes with other countries within and outside the region.

Tuvalu is aiming to transform towards a circular economy as the country sees it as the only way to address the increasing amount of waste that ends up in landfills annually and to achieve SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols. To do so, Tuvalu is strengthening engagement with the private sector in order to explore opportunities to reduce the amount of disposable waste and to ensure that all recyclable waste is shipped overseas for proper treatment and processing.

Tuvalu is also actively engaged in the EU-funded Pacific Waste Management Programme (PacWastePlus), implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), to further strengthen the country’s waste management. This project especially focuses on e-waste streams as a national waste priority, and provides technical assistance in Tuvalu’s transition towards a circular economy. The PacWastePlus programme, which is working with 14 Pacific countries and Timor-Leste, has a strong focus on improving data collection, information sharing, and education and awareness. The project also works with countries on developing and implementing policies and regulatory frameworks, implementing best practices to enhance private sector engagement and infrastructure development, and human capacity.

Yet the 2019 Annual Review recognizes that the enforcement of government waste management-related legislation, regulations, and policies is “generally weak,” which is related to a lack public awareness and education programmes carried out thus far. The report outlines emergent waste issues of importance for Tuvalu such as marine litter, healthcare waste, asbestos, and sewage and sludge. To mitigate these emergent issues, the Annual Review recommends the incorporation in the refined action plan 2017-2021 of measures, including:

Enforcement of law on illegal dumping along the coastline;

Regular monitoring of ships’ compliance with waste management standards;

Enforcement of law on littering;

Putting in place a proper healthcare waste management system;

Public awareness and education on asbestos features and their locations in Tuvalu;

Installation of a proper treatment system for sewage and sludge; and

Women groups taking the lead on addressing illegal dumping and littering problems.

Finally, the Annual Review cautions that, due to the nature of the policy goals, it will take time to realize some of the impacts, particularly those related to the need to change people’s attitudes to waste.

Presenting the report’s highlights at UN Headquarters on 10 March 2020, Taalas said that: 2019 was the second warmest year on record and ended with a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels; 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record; and CO2 levels had reached a new peak in January and February 2020.

The report highlights the physical indicators of climate change, such as increasing land and ocean heat, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice. It also addresses the impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security, and land and marine ecosystems. It includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, international experts, scientific institutions and UN agencies, and provides information for policymakers to consider in their decision-making processes.

In his presentation, Taalas said that a recent decadal forecast from the UK’s Met Office indicates a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years, and, over 10 years, temperature estimates range from 1.1 to 1.65°C, exceeding the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. Taalas said that while developed countries have been able to decouple economic growth from emissions growth, developing countries have not yet done so.

Taalas highlighted that smoke and pollutants from the Australian wildfires reverberated across the globe, causing an increase in CO2 emissions, and record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier with significant impacts on sea level rise. He warned of a growing water crisis in parts of Africa and in Southern Asia, many areas of which depend on glaciers as the main freshwater source.

Other examples of socioeconomic impacts highlighted in the report include a deteriorating food security situation in some countries in 2019 due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict, and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people in the Horn of Africa were estimated to be severely food insecure. In addition, unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 contributed to a locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, the worst in over 25 years.

The report also addresses high-impact events, including:

floods in Southern Asia, Iran, the US, which experienced US$20 billion in losses, and South America, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion;

drought, with Australia having its driest year on record;

heatwaves, with record-breaking temperatures in Australia and Europe;

tropical cyclones in the Bahamas and along the eastern coast of Africa, increasing food insecurity and displacement; and

increased wildfire activity in high-latitude areas, such as Siberia and Alaska and even in parts of the Arctic, where such events were previously rare.

Responding to questions regarding the impacts of the coronavirus on climate change, its short-term contribution to decreased emissions, and its potential to drain resources and political will from climate efforts, Guterres said he expects the impacts of and efforts related to coronavirus to be temporary and underscored the need to ensure that efforts to fight the virus do not distract from addressing climate change. Taalas added that while the virus is negatively impacting the economy in the short term, the economic consequences of non-action on climate change over the long term would be massive.

The Outlook, titled, ‘Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk,’ investigates best- and worst-case scenarios and calls on governments to act immediately to limit the spread of the virus, protect people and businesses from its effects, and strengthen economic demand.

The report notes that broader spread of the virus across the wider Asia-Pacific region and advanced economies could result in global growth as low as 1.5% this year, cutting in half the OECD’s 2020 projection from November 2019. Containment measures and loss of confidence could reduce production and spending and lead to a recession in some countries.

G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus.

The report calls for flexible working situations to keep as many jobs as possible, and implementation of temporary tax and budgetary measures to soften the impact in affected sectors, such as travel and tourism. The OECD also calls for adequate liquidity in the most affected countries to enable banks to help companies with cash-flow problems while containing the virus.

The report points out that the G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence. The Outlook concludes that, inter alia:

contractions in China are being felt globally, reflecting China’s critical role in global supply chains, travel and commodity market;

outbreaks in other economies are having similar effects;

prospects for China have been revised, with growth slipping below 5% in 2020, before recovering to over 6% in 2021, as output returns to levels projected prior to the outbreak of the virus;

the adverse impacts on confidence, financial markets, the travel sector and disruption to supply chains contribute to the downward revisions in all G20 economies in 2020; and

a longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America could cause global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020, half the projected rate prior to the outbreak.

The Outlook calls for: ensuring well-resourced public health measures to prevent infection and contagion; implementing policies that support health care systems and workers; and protecting incomes of vulnerable social groups and businesses. The report further states that macroeconomic policies can help restore confidence and demand recovery as outbreaks ease, but that it cannot offset immediate disruptions from enforced shutdowns and travel restrictions. If growth is weaker for an extended period of time, coordinated multilateral action will be required.

87,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iddri-brief-identifies-priorities-for-biodiversity-framework-negotiations/,"Tue, 03 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IDDRI Brief Identifies Priorities for Biodiversity Framework Negotiations,"The Institut du Développement Durable et des Relations Internationals (IDDRI) has published a policy brief analyzing the zero draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The brief calls for a concise final text, the mainstreaming of biodiversity across all relevant sectors, as well as the mobilization of States and other stakeholders to achieve the highest ambition possible.

The zero draft’s proposed framework , published on 13 January, presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five longer-term goals.

The IDDRI brief discusses some of the sticking points likely to arise in forthcoming negotiations of the post-2020 framework. It describes a “potential trade-off between “ambition” and “realism” in the draft, noting a reduction in ambition from the Aichi Targets. For instance, the Aichi Targets called for the prevention of species extinction whereas the zero draft calls for a reduction in the number of threatened species. For habitat loss, the language is also less ambitious, reading, “no net loss” versus “habitat loss at least halved”. The brief emphasizes that with the credibility of international governance at stake, targets should be achievable.

With the credibility of international governance at stake, targets should be achievable.

Other thorny issues in the forthcoming negotiations, per the brief, will be the question of baselines as well as attributing improvement in ecosystems services to enhanced biodiversity conservation. On baselines, there is a risk of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) complicating negotiations. The brief gives the example of the IPBES baseline of 1970, which advantages developed countries that already transitioned through the major drivers of biodiversity loss and habitat conversion in years (if not centuries) prior to this date. Meanwhile developing countries’ drivers of loss and their related impacts on biodiversity are unfolding now. The brief argues that there are “numerous other ways to address fairness and equity issues in the framework” without risking the derailment of the negotiation process with CBDR. On the issue of ecosystem services, the brief gives the example of clean water, noting that improvements could come via pathways that do not improve the status of biodiversity or ecosystem services, and that such issues could be addressed with a “rewording and proposal of metrics, that would ensure that it is the services provided by ecosystems that are enhanced.”

The brief goes on to present small modifications to the language of the zero draft on areas key for upcoming discussions. It discusses habitat loss, pollution, and human-wildlife conflict. The publication also calls for “strengthening” synergies with related multilateral processes (in addition to the biodiversity-related conventions, the oceans conventions, the other Rio conventions, and other MEAs) and expanding tools and solutions to target all subsidies that negatively impact on biodiversity as well as to shift public and corporate incentives and policy.

The brief concludes by calling for biodiversity mainstreaming at every level, including through the mechanisms of the High-level Political Forum as a way to promote linkages across the achievement of all the SDGs. It also highlights the importance of improved transparency and responsibility for all national actors. [Publication: A good working basis in the making.

88,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-imperative-of-ending-wildlife-crime/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Imperative of Ending Wildlife Crime,"Reports that the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated from illegally sourced wildlife, including pangolin, has given a new sense of urgency to ending wildlife crime. Wildlife crime is not new, yet, remarkably, there is no global legal agreement addressing it. This is despite the devastating impact it has on wildlife, local communities, national economies, security, public health and entire ecosystems, and its links to HIV Aids, Ebola, SARS, MERS and now COVID -19.

We are not talking about subsistence poaching, which is a separate and distinct issue to be resolved locally, but rather, large-scale criminal activity organized transnationally and fueled by corruption. A recent World Bank report estimates the value of illegally traded species at US$200 billion, when all wildlife, including fish and timber not listed under CITES are included.

Saving wildlife, and, as we now see, ourselves, means stopping an illegal commerce that shifts thousands of tonnes of contraband, worth billions of dollars and leaves death, destruction, and instability in its wake. Ending wildlife crime requires a new level of international cooperation that assures criminals feel the long arm of the law. The time for bold action is now.

No longer a tenable solution

Currently and by default, we have turned to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a trade-related conservation convention from the 1970’s, to serve as the de facto legal instrument for combating serious wildlife crimes. The problem is that CITES wasn’t designed to deal with wildlife crime. It was meant to regulate wildlife trade to avoid over-exploitation of threatened species.

While a critically important trade convention, it was never designed to fight crime. CITES has its limitations. It only applies to species listed in its appendices – that is 36,000 of the world’s eight million species – and to the cross-border movement of specimens. It doesn’t require illegal trade to be criminalized, nor does it apply to poaching. However, in the absence of any alternative, over the past decade, CITES has been leveraged to crank up the fight against illegal wildlife trade.

Even with its limitations, CITES has had some success in this regard. It led the creation of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in 2010[i], which was welcomed by CITES Parties in 2013[ii]. In parallel to the Consortium, the UN General Assembly passed a first-ever Resolution on Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2015, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) released the first-ever UN World Wildlife Crime Report in 2016. Over the years, CITES has seen the deeper engagement of police and customs agents, and action by key industry sectors, including finance, transport, and tourism.

Yet, a serious underlying problem remains, one for which we are now paying a heavy price. There is no international legal framework for cooperative global and national action to catch and punish serious wildlife criminals, nor is there an agreed definition of wildlife crime. This inhibits global enforcement efforts and jeopardizes the lives of park rangers, creates insecurity and undermines conservation schemes. It robs local communities of their resources and it elevates the risk of future disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

Transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

Given the scale and seriousness of wildlife crime and its grave implications for countries, their ecosystems and species, and for humanity overall, it can and must be dealt with by police, prosecutors and the judiciary – not by individuals such as conservationists or park rangers acting alone. We need an unequivocal political message, supported by the right legal framework, that organized, transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

We must move with the times

The time has come for a new global agreement on wildlife crime.

This agreement can be housed under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC), as has been done for other serious crimes such as human trafficking. Such an agreement should oblige countries to prohibit the import of any wildlife[iii], supported by criminal sanctions, unless the importer can prove it was legally obtained[iv].

This idea was put forward at the recent ‘End Wildlife Crime’ event at the House of Lords, which promoted a new agreement on wildlife crime that criminalizes the importation, distribution and consumption of illegally sourced wildlife. What is proposed is not unlike the approach taken in some countries, such as in the US under the Lacey Act, and what some countries have in place for certain timber imports.

Doing things differently requires us to take a fresh look at historic approaches to conservation and question their ongoing efficacy in a changing world. Making bold but necessary changes will prove difficult and stir up resistance. But the status quo won’t do; nor will incremental changes. It’s abundantly clear that we need to scale up the fight against the transnational, organized criminals who are stripping countries bare of their precious wildlife and creating havoc locally and globally. To stop them we need to get police and prosecutors hot on their trail.

Global responses to biodiversity loss must move with the times and if we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organized criminals, while opening up new opportunities for local communities in and around biodiverse-rich areas, then we will not only end wildlife crime but see wildlife, ecosystems and local communities thrive.

The report states that this SDG target “will be missed,” underscoring the need to increase “efforts to generate decent jobs for the next generation of workers.”

The report titled, ‘Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Technology and the Future of Jobs,’ highlights that the number of young people classified as NEET has risen from 259 million in 2016 to 267 million in 2019, and is expected to continue increasing to approximately 273 million in 2021. Young women are twice as likely as young men to face precarious employment situations, and two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women. The gender gap is even more pronounced in the Arab States and Southern Asia, where cultural and social norms are more likely to prevent women from pursuing education or working outside the house. Youth unemployment also varies by region, from 30% in Northern Africa to less than 9% in Northern America.

Two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women.

The report finds that a narrow focus on vocational training, a lack of jobs to match qualifications, and increasing automation are creating a “precarious future in the labor market” for young people. Employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are at greater risk of losing their jobs because of further technological advances than older workers.

The report also identifies challenges with vocational training, which tends to impart occupation-specific skills that become obsolete faster than general education skills. As a result, employees with vocational training are even more vulnerable. To address these concerns, the report calls for modernizing vocational training programmes to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy.

Young people who complete tertiary education are less likely to lose jobs to automation. However, the increase in the number of young people with degrees has outpaced the demand for graduate labor, resulting in falling returns to tertiary education and pushing down wages for graduates. The report addresses a number of additional challenges, including informal and less secure forms of employment and a digital divide between regions and generations.

The report recommends an integrated policy framework to support young people’s ascent into decent jobs and to assure that new technologies positively impact on youth employment. The report argues for policies to generate a sufficient number of decent jobs, to equip young people with the skills needed for those jobs, and ensure social protection for workers.

With trade recognized as a “means of implementation” under Agenda 2030, policymakers need to ensure that measures affecting trade and markets take into consideration efforts to achieve SDG 2. Resolving the trade-offs between competing policy objectives requires meaningful analysis and discussion within the context of multilateral agreements, to take account of the measures that could contribute to achieving SDG 2.

The five specific targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aim for improvements related to a range of issues. The targets are: end hunger (2.1); end all forms of malnutrition (2.2); double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (2.3); ensure sustainable food production systems (2.4); and maintain genetic diversity (2.5).

This is ambitious, given the current situation.

According to the most recent estimates, 821.6 million, or one out of every 10 people in the world, are undernourished, and roughly 728 million people are estimated to be obese. And, there are 736 million people living in extreme poverty, with a majority engaged in the agri-food sector. At the same time, agricultural production systems face a number of environmental challenges related to soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and water use and pollution.

Trade and related policies play a significant role in this context, as governments often use such measures to address food security as well as agricultural development objectives. Policies that can affect trade and markets include border measures like tariffs, export restrictions and non-tariff measures, as well as “behind-the-border” domestic support such as input and output subsidies, market price support, public investments in infrastructure and R&D, and some forms of income support programmes.

The domestic and international impacts of each of these policies can differ depending on whether the country is a net exporter or importer, a small or big producer or consumer, and the way in which policies are designed and implemented.

In addition, impacts may differ in the short versus longer run.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.

ON COMPETING PRIORITIES

The use of export restrictions is an example of competing priorities of a border measure, in particular between short- and longer-run objectives within the domestic market, and between the policy objectives of two trading partners. Export restrictions are usually used to address domestic food security concerns related to rising food prices. Such measures often have the immediate effect of increasing food availability and lowering food prices in domestic markets, therefore contributing to the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. However, there might be negative implications for producer incomes (SDG target 2.3), which may be significantly reduced by lower food prices.

In the medium-to-long run, the initial effects of such a policy may be completely reversed as farmers respond to lower prices and policy uncertainty by decreasing cultivated areas. This can contribute to lower production and higher prices in the medium-to-long run, thus mitigating the initial positive implications of the measure for SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. Furthermore, the application of export restrictions can undermine the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2 in importing countries by lowering food availability on world markets and contributing to higher prices, particularly if measures are implemented simultaneously by many exporting countries.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.



Behind-the-border measures such as input subsidies and market price support measures also involve important choices between different policy objectives. They can have positive implications for the achievement of SDG target 2.3 as they can improve farmer incomes. However, in addition to their high fiscal cost and administrative burden, they can negatively affect the achievement of SDG target 2.4, in particular if they provide production incentives for products with high GHG emissions.

In addition, there might be consequences related to SDG target 2.3 at an international level as such measures may lower prices and undermine the opportunity for small-scale producers in the importing country to sell their products in international markets.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTILATERAL TRADE RULES

Some measures generally have positive implications for the achievement of SDG 2 targets. These include public investments in infrastructure like storage facilities that can improve farmer prices (affecting SDG target 2.3), rural roads that can connect producers to markets (affecting SDG target 2.3), and efficiencies in trade and logistics that can reduce food waste and bring farm products where they are needed (affecting SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2).

As these measures do not typically involve transfers to individual producers, they usually fall under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) green box category and are not subject to any limitation. Moreover, the first means of implementation target of SDG 2 (i.e. 2.A), commits countries to “increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks…”

For other measures that can have production and trade-distorting effects, not only are they subject to limits in the multilateral trading system, but SDG 2’s other two means of implementation targets focus on improving the functioning of agricultural markets. In particular, target 2.B commits countries to “correct and prevent distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect…”

While progress on indicator 2.B has been made with the WTO Nairobi Ministerial Decision, achieving SDG 2 and resolving the trade-offs requires that governments go beyond a narrow focus on the elimination of export subsidies. Instead, policymakers need to take a broader approach to indicators of progress that encompass a range of measures that affect trade and markets in the global food system.

92,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/icao-identifies-six-eligible-carbon-offsetting-programmes-for-aviation-industry/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICAO Identifies Six Eligible Carbon-Offsetting Programmes for Aviation Industry,"Recent meetings organized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), addressed steps by ICAO to address the aviation industry’s negative environmental externalities.

At the ICAO Council meeting, which convened from 2-20 March 2020, in Montréal, Canada, the Council adopted a standard to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health, and took further decisions on implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA is a market-based mechanism adopted in 2016 to achieve ICAO’s goals of increasing fuel efficiency by 2% per year and carbon-neutral growth of civil aviation from 2020 onwards. The mechanism aims to cap aviation’s future emissions growth by obliging airlines to buy offsets, rather than reducing their aircraft emissions.

The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase. These six programmes are:

American Carbon Registry

China Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Voluntary Emission Reduction Program

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Climate Action Reserve

The Gold Standard

Verified Carbon Standard

The Council’s decision follows recommendations by the Technical Advisory Body (TAB), which it established and tasked with evaluating whether carbon-offsetting programs satisfy the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). Public comments were also received, including from experts at Europe-based research institutes Öko-Institut, Perspectives, and Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), who published their analysis of 14 carbon-offsetting programs in October 2019.

In accordance with TAB’s recommendations on “eligibility timeframe” and “unit date eligibility,” the emissions units are issued to activities that commenced as of 1 January 2016, and in respect of emissions reductions occurring through 31 December 2020, subject to each programme’s scope of eligibility. The list of eligible emissions units will eventually be publicly available on the ICAO CORSIA website.

In its assessment and recommendation of programmes, TAB highlighted the following criteria:

Permanence: Carbon offset credits must represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or carbon sequestration that are permanent, whereby any given risk of reductions or removals being reversed require that either such credits are not eligible or measures are in place to monitor, mitigate, and compensate incidences of material leakage.

Additionality: Carbon offset programmes must generate units that represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or removals that are additional, including that they exceed any GHG reduction or removals required by law, regulation, or legally binding mandate.

Avoidance of double counting towards mitigation obligations: Measures must be in place to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming such as could occur by claims from both an airline and the host country of the emissions reduction activity.

Monitoring, reporting and verification: Emissions reduction is calculated in a conservative and transparent manner, verified by an accredited independent entity prior to issuance of offset credits, which should be based on accurate measurements and monitored on a regular basis.

Public disclosure of sustainable development: A programme should list the criteria used regarding alignment with the SDGs.

The selected programmes performed differently, and none perfectly against all EUCs, the TAB recommendations and expert submissions reveal. TAB underscores that various programmes “made substantial progress” towards addressing certain shortcomings, or have “indicated willingness to put in place measures to ensure consistency with the EUCs.” Still, experts proposed that programmes be approved only provisionally until they satisfy all EUCs, to avoid risks for CORSIA’s integrity. Experts also called on ICAO to provide further clarity on which global warming potential values the programmes should use when issuing CORSIA eligible offset credits.

The January 2020 report from TAB recommends that the Council request from most of the eligible carbon-offsetting programs further specified actions following its decision, with the exception of the CDM. This is because the future of registered CDM activities is still being negotiated in the context of the rules, modalities, procedures, and guidelines for Article 6 (cooperative approaches) of the Paris Agreement on climate change. International guidance on the transition of the CDM is needed since all participating Paris Agreement parties will have to correspondingly adjust their emission levels and targets upon transfer of mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting.

On using carbon offset credits under CORSIA, experts hope that Paris Agreement parties will provide clarity on:

How emission reductions not covered by Parties’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) should be treated;

What key elements are necessary for letters of attestation and authorization by host countries to confirm avoidance of double counting so the units can be used under CORSIA;

How additionality of activities can be proven; and

What actions should trigger corresponding adjustments to account for the use of offset credits under CORSIA.

The ICAO Council also improved its environmental standards to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health. Environmental and health impact assessments of aircraft engine emissions rely on Particulate Matter (PM) characteristics such as number, size, and composition, but reported PM emissions data varied due to different sampling protocols and methodologies used. For emission certification purposes, measurement methodologies needed to be standardized. Engine manufacturers use certification of aircraft engines for non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions.

At its March 2020 meeting, the ICAO Council adopted a “non-volatile PM (nvPM) mass and number Standard” for aircraft engines. The standard applies to engine designs of rated thrust greater than 26.7 Kilonewton and will govern both new and in-production engines from 2023 onwards. ICAO aims to ensure that only the most effective nvPM reduction technologies are employed in post-2023 aircraft engine designs.","The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase.

The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.” It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.

The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.

Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.

The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds, inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.

To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:

achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;

“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; and

in the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.

The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.

The event has never been timelier. The rapidly spreading coronavirus is suspected to have jumped from the most trafficked species on Earth (pangolins), while the world’s leading scientists have concluded that an anthropogenic-driven crisis now threatens at least one million species with extinction.

With the WWD convening under the theme, ‘Sustaining all Life on Earth’, has there ever been a more pressing time to draw attention to the links between humanity and the Earth’s flora and fauna? Nature is waving warning flags.

There were some notable announcements on the Day. Technology companies of the ‘Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online’ said they removed or blocked over three million listings for endangered and threatened species and associated products from their online platforms, to date. The results were publicized as part of the report titled, ‘Offline and in the Wild,’ produced by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)-led coalition.

In partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Ocean Agency launched Glowing Glowing Gone, a creative awareness campaign to bring attention to coral fluorescence due to climate change. The campaign’s press release instructs that corals fluoresce as a last line of defense before dying or bleaching, a phenomena made more common by warming seas. The Ocean Agency worked with Pantone and Adobe to turn the warning colors of glowing coral into three official Pantone colors, to inspire action that everyone can use.

The Day also saw traditional and high-level awareness raising. The Ambassador of India to the UN in New York, the Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the UN, the CITES Secretary-General, and the President of the Wildlife Conservation Society were among speakers at a high-level event at UN Headquarters in New York. On the creative front, Jackson Wild™ led the organization of the fifth iteration of a wildlife-themed film festival with some 350 entries, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare held an international WWD youth art contest that featured youth artists’ expressions of the Day’s theme.

Just after the Day, UNEP announced that the theme of the fifth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) will be: ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The session is set to take place from 22-26 February 2021 in Nairobi, Kenya. Speaking on the UNEA theme, Sveinung Rotevatn, Norway’s Minister of Climate and the Environment and President of the Assembly said, “Nature is the solution we in many ways take for granted, but that we cannot afford to lose.” Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, while addressing the WWD, pointed out that humanity seems to have “forgotten just how much we need nature for our survival and well-being.”

As the UN dubbed ‘Super Year’ crescendos towards global agenda-setting meetings on oceans and a post-2020 biodiversity framework, events on World Wildlife Day highlighted that humanity needs to notice that glowing corals aren’t the only thing signaling, ‘Going … Going … Gone.’ [UNEP Press Release] [UNDP Press Release] [UN News] [WWF Press Release] [WWD Landing Page] [Policy Brief on Nature]","World Wildlife Day (WWD), held annually on 3 March, is meant to celebrate biodiversity and raise global awareness of our relationship with plants and animals.

The term is used to describe the selective reporting of companies’ impacts, sans failures, in regard to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

It appears to be an issue of omission and one-sided reporting, according to the Responsible Mining Foundation, an independent research organization that supports the proliferation of responsible mining, which found that many of the world’s largest mining companies have continuously failed to mention any negative impacts that might impede achievement of the SDGs, the organization said, in its recent RMI Report 2020.

The report is an “evidence-based assessment” of the economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) policies and practices of 38 large-scale mining companies, which means that its data helps paint a truly global picture — the firms operate in more than 780 mine sites, and together account for 28 percent of the world’s mining activity by value of production, according to RMI. The data was gathered throughout a one-year study, and approximately two months were spent reviewing and assessing various aspects of each company.

According to the International Labor Organization, mining remains one of the top three most hazardous sectors. RMF’s raison d’être is to support the principle that “minerals and metals mining should benefit the economies, improve the lives of peoples and respect the environments of producing countries, while allowing companies and their investors to make a fair and viable return.”

By the Numbers

Mapped to the SDGs and approximately 50 international initiatives, standards or guidelines related to responsible mining or corporate accountability, RMF’s methodology is thorough, to say the least.

RMF’s index is shaped by a specific analytical framework, comprised of six thematic areas: economic development, business conduct, lifecycle management, community well-being, working conditions and environmental responsibility. This is in addition to 76 individual indicators that were distributed among three measurement areas: commitment (follow-through on what they said they’d do), action (what they’ve done so far) and effectiveness (meaningful, measurable outcomes).

More specifically, each category includes an in-depth assessment into companies’ said “progress.” RMF explained, “Commitment indicators assess the extent to which companies have formalized their commitments on particular issues, assigned responsibilities and accountabilities for the implementation of these commitments, and provided resources and staffing to operationalize the commitments. Action indicators assess the extent to which companies have developed systematic approaches to address particular issues and disclose key aspects of their activities, and Effectiveness indicators assess the extent to which companies track, and report on, their performance in managing particular issues and demonstrate continuous improvement on these issues.”

The report also assesses 180 individual mine sites in 45 countries against 10 basic indicators of responsible mining, including local employment; local procurement; post-closure plans; community grievances; worker grievances; air quality; water quality; tailings management; and emergency preparedness.

A Red Flag

But for mining companies, “SDG-washing” is highlighting specific stats that give the impression of responsible mining, which “fails to present stakeholders with a true picture of the challenges the mining sector faces in its support of the SDGs,” according to RMF.

The disillusion surrounding the industry’s progress thus far in its quest for responsible mining has led to a “disconnect between company-wide policies and standards, versus actual on-the-ground actions at mine sites, where the impacts of mining are most evident,” RMF said, raising a huge red flag that encourages industry members to take a deeper look at companies’ claims versus reality.

Who’s Who

The list of mining companies in the report includes Anglo American; AngloGold Ashanti; Antofagasta; ArcelorMittal; Banpu; Barrick Gold Corp; BHP; Buenaventura; Bumi Resources; China Shenhua; Coal India;, Codelco; ERG; Evraz; Exxaro Resources; First Quantum Minerals; Fortescue; Freeport-McMoRan; Glencore; Gold Fields; Grupo México; Industrias Peñoles; MMG; Navoi MMC; Newcrest Mining; Newmont; NMDC; Nordgold; Orano; Peabody Energy; Polymetal; Rio Tinto; RUSAL; Sibanye-Stillwater; Teck; Vale; Vedanta Resources; and Zijin.

Hélène Piaget, chief executive officer of the Responsible Mining Foundation, said that the SDGs “provide a valuable societal framework for reporting and action on economic, social and environmental concerns, but an unbalanced emphasis on the ‘good’ that companies do may obscure the negative impacts, be they inherent or unintentional, that may impede the achievement of the SDG goals.”

Piaget added that a proactive approach toward the SDGs, in tandem with data transparency, can reap positive results for mining companies. “While the trust-deficit with society is recognized as the number-one risk for mining companies, the RMI Report 2020 acts as a prompt to the industry to eliminate the need to respond to multiple information requests. By proactively making EESG data available — starting at individual mine sites and in open data formats companies can help to build trust, limit risk, and show respect. In fact, more proactive data disclosure will reduce the demand for companies’ reporting.”

Great Expectations

Since the last RMI assessment in 2018, several large-scale mining companies have been “at the center of major controversies as mine tailings failures have claimed scores of lives, devastated whole communities and caused major environmental disasters,” RMF noted.

Afshin Mehrpouya, associate professor at HEC Paris and member of the Board of the RMF, said that “Such tragedies reflect very poorly on the sector as a whole and put into stark perspective companies’ claims of responsible mining. The industry must redouble its efforts to prove that it prioritizes broader ESG responsibilities over short-term considerations.”

And it can be done. Similar to the prior assessment, this year’s report noted that “mining can meet society’s expectations.” The RMF said “if one company were to achieve all the highest scores recorded” in each of the indicators, “it would reach more than 70 percent of the maximum achievable score.”

And similarly, the RMF said if one mine site “were to achieve all the highest scores seen for the asset-level indicators, it would score over 80 percent. All companies are encouraged to adopt more systematically the good practices already being demonstrated across the sector.”

Commitment Issues

Usually, good comes with the bad — and in the case of mining, it’s no different: The report noted a “modest overall improvement” by companies on many of the issues previously assessed in 2018. Albeit, “much of the improvement is due to companies making commitments, with markedly less evidence of progress in following up these commitments with concrete actions,” RMF said, adding that “the weakest results relate to companies’ efforts to track, review and act to improve the effectiveness of their actions on EESG issues.”

RMF explained, “So while commitments are a step in the right direction, the mining sector as a whole would benefit – both in terms of its performance and its trust-building with other stakeholders – from being able to demonstrate more consistent implementation of commitments across operational portfolios and across issues.”

The Bottom Line

And as it goes with most sustainability topics, transparency is critical — RMF said that not only was there little evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighboring communities, workers, governments and investors, the organization was hard-pressed to find evidence of companies engaging with local stakeholders on important issues, inclusive of local procurement, grievance mechanisms or air and water quality, all according to RMF.

Of the 180 individual mine sites assessed, only one site scores more than 50 percent — the other 145 sites scored less than 20 percent, and 45 sites scored zero on all 10 indicators, the report said.

All in all, it boils down to the bottom line: “None of the companies [showed] consistent performance across the mine sites they own or operate.”

By Ashok Pandey

THE NITI AAYOG released the second version of the SDG India Index and Dashboard on December 20, 2019. India, as a signatory to adoption of UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is under obligation

to streamline development policies for a time-bound (by 2030) achievement of human well-being. The 17 goals and 169 related targets weave around five pillars— People (first six goals), Prosperity (next five), Planet (following four goals), Peace (goal 16) and Partnership (goal 17). Achieving these requires government’s commitment, people’s participation, allocation of funds, intergovernmental cooperation, technology and innovation.

The SDG Index is the first attempt at the national level to assess where each state and UT stands on achieving SDGs. The SDG India Index 2.0 uses a hundred indicators covering 16 goals (barring goal 17 for want of sufficient inputs) and 54 targets. The Index has played a vital role in driving the SDG agenda in India. Budgetary allocation is an essential component of pushing the SDG agenda forward. Prominent themes in this year’s Budget include working for an aspirational India, ensuring economic development for all, fostering a caring society and ease of living. These also cover most SDG goals around People and Prosperity.

The finance minister gave a big push to wellness, water and sanitation by providing Rs 69,000 crore for the health sector. Of this, Rs 6,400 crore is for the PM Jan Arogya Yojana, extending its reach to 20,000 empanelled hospitals, and Rs 3.6 lakh crore approved for the Jal Jeevan Mission, of which Rs 11,500 crore will be available for 2020-21. Cities with a million plus population are mandated to achieve the objective this year. Also, Rs 3,000 crore additional will be available for skill development, and the National Skill Development Agency will give a special thrust to infrastructure-focused skill development— infrastructure projects will involve young engineers, management graduates and economists from universities.

Women-specific schemes, nutrition enhancement and financial support to uplift the conditions of young girls contribute significantly to achieve educational, health and financial targets under different SDG goals. There are conscious efforts and the intent to reduce fossil-fuel based power to meet the objectives under goal 13. An allocationof Rs 4,400 crore has gone to the 16 action points for agriculture, irrigation and rural development. Additional allowances will help propel fish production and export. Encouragement to growing algae, seaweed and cage culture will give a boost to the blue economy.

The finance minister’s statement to ensure corruption-free, policy-driven governance is a welcome step. Providing justice and building strong institutions will enhance the Index ranking undergoal 16. The government’s recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and new technologies to augment our efforts in achieving plan 2030 is also commendable. The SDG India Index noted that Tamil Naidu and Jammu & Kashmir performed the best amongst states and UTs, respectively, in alleviating poverty. This means better performance in achieving the targets under SDG goal 1— reducing extreme and multi-dimensional poverty, improving social protection and safety net, providing the necessary services and mitigating a multitude of natural disasters.

A similar indexing in achieving other targets is both instructive and encouraging. The SDG India Index, together with the budgetary mandate, should serve as a reminder that with intentional policy and

action on the ground, it is possible to achieve the goals of well-being. The interstate and inter-UT competitions and a mature and people-centric federal interdependence augur well for the country. The NITIAayog’s SDG India Index 2.0 will serve as a facilitative rubric to bring transparency, accountability and urgency for judicious utilisation of national resources.

97,https://science.thewire.in/health/sdg-compliance-of-maternal-mortality-a-cause-for-concern-or-celebration/,"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Wire,SDG Compliance of Maternal Mortality: A Cause for Concern or Celebration?,"While the aggregate Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) seem realisable, the disturbing part of the story is the stark intra-country disparities that reveal differential vulnerabilities across regions.

With the commitment towards compliance with the SDGs, there is a definite improvement in the data system to obtain the relevant estimates for indicators representing each of the goals. In the process of obtaining these estimates, two concerns arise: the levels of disaggregation and the reliability of the estimates conditioned by the rarity of the event or phenomenon.

In terms of an adverse indicator, like the maternal mortality rate,, the two concerns are equally relevant in the sense that with decline in this adversity, there is a compromise in its reliability. Further, its disaggregation obtains differentially reliable estimates ineligible for comparison.

A 2015 WHO study on the reduction of MMR by 75% from 1990 to 2015 in the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) suggested that, by 2013, MMR was reduced by 45%, from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births – reflecting substantial progress but still falling far short of the global MDG goals. MMR reduction is a priority in the SDGs, with the broad objective to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

Hence, it is questionable as to whether such estimates be obtained in brief periodicity (i.e. every three years) based on the same sample coverage and secondly should these estimates be compared across regions with differential reliability. The following discussion elaborates on this pressing concern to draw attention of policy makers.

The most recently released statistics on maternal mortality notes a decline of 8 units in the maternal mortality ratio in the gap of three years, which is a positive trend. The target level of SDGs for this indicator is 70 per one lakh live births by the year 2030, and this seems very much within the horizon given the declining exposure to reproduction on one hand and ever-increasing extent of institutional deliveries on the other. While this aggregate achievement seems realisable, the disturbing part of the story lies in the intra country disparities which are stark and revealing of the differential vulnerabilities across regions.

The national achievement makes a specific region 1.8 times more vulnerable vis-à-vis the other two regions 0.52 and 0.63 times-less vulnerable based on the MMR. These differences are alarming in the sense that they are not merely guided by the differential risk of reproduction alone as convergence in fertility decline across the country is a reality. Further, such a pattern could very well lead to compliance with the SDG target at the national level leaving behind some regions with such adversities. The race towards compliance with SDGs has always this limitation as one of the authors of this note observed in the initial years of SDG formulation as to whether target compliance will compromise on equities.

The three regional estimates of MMR put the southern region comprising five states at 72, a group of other six states of the north and western region at 90 against the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states with the inclusion of Assam at 175. Apart from these regional estimates, Assam leads the table with an MMR levels of 229 followed by Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar which have MMR estimates closer to 200. One would imagine that these are purely a derivative of differential exposure to reproduction but it is not the case given the decline in fertility levels across the EAG states.

There is apprehension as to such high levels of MMRs may not necessarily be associated with childbirth alone but miscarriages and non-clinical abortions as well. The levels of MMRs in EAG states are distinctly higher compared with other states except in Punjab. Another aspect of this comparison relates to the statistical reliability of these estimates. The high levels of MMR in EAG states do have the widest possible confidence intervals understandably owing to the rarity of this event. But the kind of decline that is celebrated should also take into account the wide confidence intervals as they might otherwise be a statistical construct and not a real decline at all. In that sense, the regional estimates are somewhat acceptable for comparison which presents a clear regional divide that needs focus and attention.

Another aspect of this phenomenon is to situate them in an age profile to identify age-specific vulnerabilities. Given that a larger share of fertility or childbirth related experience is below the age of 30 years, a risk evaluation indicates that almost two-thirds of maternal deaths are happening between ages 20-30 years of age. Hence, the common understanding that adolescent motherhood or high-risk age of maternity do not seem to intensify this problem. In addition, the fertility transition too places this age bracket to share a significant share of the childbirth experience. This suggests towards targeting the younger and primipara women to comply with institutional deliveries as well as the maternal care continuum to avoid such adversities.

Finally, caution needs to be exercised about certifying compliance of such targets overlooking the regional disparities as well as reliability of estimates given the rarity of the phenomenon itself. While monitoring this phenomenon is desirable, it is rather important to change focus from reducing levels to that of converging them.

This is Pfizer’s first-ever sustainability bond and a first for a biopharmaceutical company.

Proceeds from the bond will help manage the company’s environmental impact and support increased patient access to Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and strengthen healthcare systems.

Environmental Impact

Recognizing the profound societal and public health impacts that may result from environmental issues, including climate change, the company is taking action to mitigate its climate impact, conserve the use of natural resources and reduce waste arising from manufacturing of medicines and vaccines.

Bond proceeds will drive strategies to become more energy efficient, conserve more water, reduce waste, and increase recycling associated with operations, and construct more energy efficient buildings. Other planned investments in physical infrastructure involve the application of technology, including sensors and insulation, that result in energy savings at Pfizer’s manufacturing and R&D sites and commercial offices globally, including new Pfizer corporate headquarters.

Social Impact

According to Pfizer, the bond proceeds will also support vulnerable population groups, including women, children under 5 years of age, and people temporarily displaced due to natural disasters and refugees who the company reaches through partnerships that address global public health emergencies.

In addition, proceeds will be used to make capital investments in manufacturing and development capacity that ensure medicines and vaccines needed and procured by governments and public health agencies are available in line with recommendations from global public health organizations. This includes work to address the global covid-19 pandemic and the threat of antimicrobial resistance.

Proceeds will also support spending to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries, including grants structured to motivate other private capital and other innovative approaches to help address infectious disease in these underserved populations.

Reporting

Pfizer will issue a report annually on the allocation of proceeds and the resulting outcomes, beginning one year from the date of issuance, including expected outcomes and impact metrics. Reporting on the use of proceeds will be accompanied by a statement from management confirmed by an examination report from an independent accountant.","Pfizer today announced the completion of a $1.25 billion 10-year sustainability bond paying interest semi-annually of 2.625% and maturing April 1, 2030.

Indonesia's Tanoto Foundation has joined hands with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to develop the first tools for measuring early childhood development in the country, in an effort to support Indonesia in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.

SDG 4 aims to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"".

More specifically, the tools are intended to help the country meet Target 4.2 by 2030: ""ensure that all boys and girls have access to quality early childhood development, care, and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education"".

Tanoto Foundation has granted UNICEF Rp 2.8 billion (US$196,556) to develop versions of the Early Childhood Development Instrument (ECDI) and the Caregiver Reported Early Development Index (CREDI) measurement instruments that have been adapted for Indonesia.

These tools provide population data on the developmental statuses of children aged 0 to 3 years and 3 to 5 years.

UNICEF will test and validate the data collected through these tools that Statistics Indonesia (BPS) can then use for the 2020 National Economic and Social Survey.

“Intervention for young children is the key to developing Indonesia's human resources, and it is one of our focus areas. Measuring and monitoring are important, as we work with evidence-based principles,” Tanoto Foundation global CEO J. Satrijo Tanudjojo said in a statement The Jakarta Post received on Thursday.

“I am looking forward to the partnership with UNICEF to develop this measurement method that can then become a contribution to the nation,” he added.

Tanoto Foundation is an independent philanthropy organization that focuses on education.

UNICEF Indonesia representative Debora Comini echoed Satrijo, saying that it was highly important to develop tools to help relevant stakeholders in measuring and monitoring early childhood development in Indonesia.

“Investing in children to help them reach their full potential is critical, but to give every child the best start in life, we need to have the right data,” Comini said in the statement.","SDG 4 aims to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"".

Experts say young-adults from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh

Addressing the obstacles faced by the younger generation in Bangladesh, especially from marginalized and indigenous parts of the society, will be a key to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), said experts and activists.

Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of the US-based charity The Hunger Project Bangladesh, said youths from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh. “They are deprived largely in social, academic, employment and even cultural affairs.”

“In order to reflect and materialize the SDG focus of leaving no one behind, we must focus on diversity, tolerance, pluralism and the atmosphere of acceptance among some major measures, or else, they will not only get derailed but also get involved in extremism in numbers,” he warned.

The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Chairman Rehman Sobhan said the work being done by the government and non-government organizations (NGOs) for the SDG implementation implies how serious they are.

Through engaging in the process, the government attest to its obstacles and reliance on the NGOs, he said, adding: “But did it formally recognize the role the NGOs are putting in?”

Rehman insisted on much more coordination among the government and non-state actors in attaining the SDG, for which he termed the next five years as highly crucial.

The noted economist suggested the civil society to recognize its role in the process and act as a pressure group, especially on behalf of the marginalized people.

“By assembling data, it can evaluate what has been and needs to be done alongside holding the government accountable for the development activities for the SDG implementation,” he further said.

Shaheen Anam of the citizen’s platform said achieving the SDGs by 2030 does not solely depend on the government’s efforts; rather it is a process that involves all citizens of the country.

“And in doing so, we have to focus more on the theme of the SDGs and the 16th goal, engaging more and more youths in the process,” she opined.

“In the past, we massively neglected the young population despite the latter being our future. We hardly thought of resolving the challenges they face,” Shaheen said.

The young must get assistance and guidance from all since their activities will decide where the country will be heading towards in the future, she said.

Transparency International Bangladesh’s (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said the 16th goal of the SDGs may be hampered by politicization within the administration, the judiciary and authorities concerned.

He alleged that the space of civil society in the development process is being gradually shrunk since it is failing to raise its voice and criticize any irregularities in development projects.

“Even the young, in many cases, feel threatened only for dissenting on any graft in the development process, thus, refraining from participating in the dialoge for accountablity,” he said.

KM Abdus Salam, director-general of NGO Affairs Bureau, said the young have nothing to worry about in inclusive growth as the government believes in ensuring development for all.

The event was addressed, among others, by the citizen’s platform Coordinator Anisatul Fatema Yousuf, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman, and ActionAid Bangladesh Country Director Farah Kabir.","The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

104,https://www.independent.co.ug/the-sdg-imperative-for-business/,"Wed, 04 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Independent,The SDG imperative for business,"The financing gap to achieve the SDGs; between $500bn and $1.2tn, is beyond what many states can deliver

COMMENT | KARNIKA YADAV | There is only one road left to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set for Africa for 2030 and that’s through sustainable businesses. The sluggish progress to date has been primarily a consequence of ‘putting all our eggs in one basket’ and expecting the state to deliver the SDGs, which it cannot.

A prime obstacle in that is finance. The SDG Center for Africa estimates the financing gap to achieve the SDGs is running at between $500 billion and $1.2 trillion a year. That is simply beyond the reach of the public sector, with the Center estimating that delivering basic state functions of health care, education, water, energy, and road infrastructure requires more than 50 per cent of the GDP of most African countries.

However, for the private sector, pursuing the 2030 goals of eradicating Africa’s hunger, poverty, and inequality and improving healthcare will deliver its own rewards, creating business opportunities worth more than a trillion dollars a year, according to United Nation estimates.

In the absence of that private sector mobilisation, progress will remain achingly slow.

The 2019 Sustainable Development Goal Three-Year Reality Checker Report found only five countries in Africa – Seychelles, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria – that had met the SDG target of three per cent poverty by 2015.

Yet the problem is substantially one of mindset. For, while achieving the right policies and public investment is necessary for delivering the SDGs, we need to abandon the idea that it is enough and focus more rigorously on developing SDG aligned businesses.

It is not viable to expect nation states to achieve a tax take, or a debt load, of 50 per cent of GDP to deliver basic services when the continent is home to a vast informal sector that contributes no government revenue at all. That ‘basic needs’ bill is just unmeetable without a leap forward in business and GDP growth.

And just as public sector SDG success depends on private sector take-off, so too does the private sector’s success.

Investing in SDG-focused businesses, calculates the UN, would create over 85 million jobs in Africa by 2030, which would in turn create new consumers and new markets.

Indeed, even relatively small investments in SDG-focused businesses can produce huge returns. For instance, investing in agriculture technology to reduce food waste could generate $57 billion a year in additional revenues, based on evidence from Rwanda; where small metal silos or plastic crates have reduced post-harvest losses by over 60 per cent and increased smallholder farmers’ incomes by more than 30 per cent.

If private businesses collaborate with local governments to provide larger infrastructures, such as ports, oil and gas extractives, power plants and automotive, shared revenue of over $296 billion could be generated and nearly 16 million jobs, according to the UN’s estimates. There could be further benefits too from using local materials for such works.

Likewise, providing affordable housing, clean water and sanitation, infrastructure and energy solutions, such as solar lanterns and improved cooking stoves to urban dwellers, has a potential revenue value of $214 billion a year and could create over 32 million jobs.

Such growth is typical for businesses focused on achieving SDGs. Indeed, research conducted by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) shows that business that is focused in SDG areas also achieves more value locally.

For instance, reports the BSDC, 71 per cent of the value of food and agriculture businesses is retained in developing countries, 60 per cent of health and wellness businesses, 54 per cent of energy and materials, and 54 per cent of the value of upgrading and developing new cities.

Overall, business models that are directed towards achieving Africa’s SDGs have proven to work to the benefit of both consumers and businesses, which is why they lie at the heart of all we are doing at Intellecap and at next week’s 7th Sankalp Summit for entrepreneurs in Nairobi.

Our initiatives to support private sector SDG initiatives include research, partnerships and projects spanning ideal adaptive technologies, such as rural solar mini-grids; private sector capacity building among communities displaced by projects such as the Olkaria geothermal plant; and assisting small producers into value addition and niche markets, in tea, in bamboo, and multiple other high potential areas.

We have no doubt that without a recalibration of our private sector SDG efforts, the 2030 goals for Africa will go unmet, whereas if we now see and seize this opportunity, no African will be left untouched by the benefits borne of SDG-focused entrepreneurs.

Roads that are subject to seasonal weight restrictions are identified with a sign. Half-loads will be enforced once signs are posted, which started March 6, 2020 and will likely run into the early part of May.

Except the following locations, most roads within SDG are subject to half-load restrictions:

– South of Highway 401 on County Road Nos. 1, 14, 33 and 35.

– County Road 15 from County Road 2 to the southwest leg of County Road 36.

– County Road 44 from Highway No. 138 to 840m East of County Road 42

– County Road Nos. 31, 34, 43, 46

– County Road No. 2 from Leeds & Grenville boundary to the City of Cornwall boundary and from the City of Cornwall boundary to the Ontario/Quebec boundary.

Benjamin de-Haan, the director of transportation and planning for the county, said half-load season is integral to the long-term sustainability of the road infrastructure within the county – the biggest municipal roads system in the entire province.

“We strive to ensure we allow for the transportation of goods across the county, while at the same time putting measures in place to protect the investment taxpayers have made in our infrastructure,” he said. “These kinds of measures are important to the bottom line of the county, as well as the effective use of taxpayer dollars.”

Why are these measures so important? Try to think of a road like a giant sandwich buried in the ground with layers that are important to the overall flavour of the road. When you add an extra ingredient – like water – your sandwich can become a mess.

The base of the road begins at its deepest point with the sub-grade material, which is typically native material or imported fill. On top of this layer is aggregate material of varying sizes of crushed stone and other granulars that are packed into place. Finally the whole thing is topped with asphalt.

The problem comes in the late winter and early spring when the heat of the sun can warm the asphalt base to several degrees above freezing, while the ambient air temperature can often be well below zero. As snow and ice melts, it can permeate the asphalt in areas. When that water refreezes, say after sunset or doing an especially cold day, the ice and trapped water will weaken the strength of the road.

By restricting the amount of weight a vehicle carries, the damage to weakened roads can be mitigated.

“Half-load season is an effective means to protect our roads,” said de-Haan. “It won’t be long before the weather warms even more, and we will remove the restrictions.”

COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR

Article content A regional state of emergency was declared on Thursday afternoon in response to COVID-19. In a press teleconference, it was announced the City of Cornwall, the United Counties of SDG, and the United Counties of Prescott-Russell were all making the declaration together, a unified front in the battle to prevent spreading of the virus. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR Back to video “We felt a regional approach to a declaration of emergency would be best,” Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement said. “It strengthens the (regional response), the importance of the message.” The message? Most have heard it but too many have not listened to it, mainly that those who are sick or are a returning traveller must isolate at home for 14 days. For those who are healthy, leaving the home should only occur when it’s an essential trip. And, people should keep two metres apart, buy only what they need at stores, wash their hands and help their neighbours. Speaking forcefully, Clement said “the time is now to flatten the curve,” and that community buy-in is “how we’re going to beat this thing. I’m calling on residents to do the right thing: stay home, stay connected, stay healthy.”

Article content Prescott-Russell Warden Pierre Leroux, in noting the measure gives municipal leaders extra powers during a crisis, said the redeployment of county resources such as personnel for emergency services was one example. Paramedic services is Prescott-Russell’s responsibility in that area, whereas the City of Cornwall administers the paramedic service within its borders and also within SDG. Leroux said the COVID-19 situation in the region “is still manageable,” but it is and will be more difficult because “we do have some ‘COVIDiots’ out there. . . we all need to get the message loud and clear.” Medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, started the teleconference by saying he’s been in close contact with municipal leaders for the last four to six weeks, and that now, that on March 26, “we felt it was a very important time to declare an emergency.” Why now? Because health experts, while acknowledging there are currently just four positive cases so far, expect the number to soon rise, and possibly quite dramatically. “We’re at the bottom of the curve, just starting to go up,” Roumeliotis said. Roumeliotis said that for the region overall, there are 300 tests still pending. He reiterated he believes there is community spread of the virus at this point, and that “our population is a vulnerable population,” because of demographics and a large number of elderly citizens, and a population with high incidence of chronic illnesses.

Article content More On This Topic Cornwall will push out funds to agencies ASAP EOHU to receive quarantine enforcement guidelines shortly Cornwall ready, and waiting, to declare a state of emergency SDG Warden Frank Prevost stressed the importance of following quarantine, self-isolation procedures, and that the declaration “gives us the opportunity to make decisions efficiently to protect the well-being of our residents.” In a question and answer session during the call, which was quite chaotic at times mainly because of ambient noise and some technical difficulties, Leroux said the declaration was both one that gives officials more power, but that it was also, and importantly, symbolic, in that “we want to make (the measures are) clear to all.” Clement expanded on earlier comments about the declaration, saying it “does give us more flexibility in how we direct resources to deal with the emergency. But the point of the regional approach is to send the strongest possible message to our residents that the time is now to slow down the spread of the virus.” The biggest concern for municipalities seems to be a flexibility to shuffle resources within their ranks. Clement explained the declaration allows staff members to be redeployed to wherever needs might be greatest moving forward, even for tasks that may not fall under that person’s collective agreement. Should the city’s own employees start to be impacted by COVID-19, that flexibility is needed to ensure the city can continue to operate. Roumeliotis was asked if a curfew could be invoked, limiting times during the day that people could be outside their homes. “It’s a last resort,” the doctor said, saying so far there’s been a “progressive approach” to having people stay at home, and that further limitations in the size of gatherings is what likely would come next. But, he said, all measures including a curfew are on the table, and that which course of action is taken “will depend completely on how the disease progresses and what toll it takes.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

Article content Bergeron went to the Downtown Business Improvement Area (BIA) website and grabbed a list of business from there. She worked with Chris Munro at Life’s Little Pleasures to have other businesses participate. Munro threw a message out on Facebook notifying owners and Bergeron reached out to the Cornwall and Area Chamber of Commerce herself so it could help spawn the idea quickly. “What happens on the business side is I take in all of the proceeds and pay it out once a week,” said Bergeron. “I’m very transparent. I shared a spreadsheet with those businesses that have made sales already. I have mentioned to them that they will get paid out every Friday through electronic money transfer (EMT). If some don’t do it that way, we’ll do cheques. “We’re really working with them to make sure that we’re promoting this in getting the word out as quick as possible because there’s just such a small margin for businesses at this point, especially restaurants.” For a full list of participating restaurants visit www.cornwall-gift-certificates.ca/.

111,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/in-updated-ndc-chile-aligns-climate-and-sustainable-development-agendas/,"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"In Updated NDC, Chile Aligns Climate and Sustainable Development Agendas","Chile has submitted its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, following submission of its first NDC in 2015. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and its Development Initiative (IDI) released this guidebook for Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs). The guidebook provides practical “how-to” guidance for SAIs in auditing their respective countries’ SDG implementation. The IDI SDGs Audit Model (ISAM) adheres to five principles: focus on outcomes; recognize SAI diversity; base the guidance on International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs); inclusiveness; and add value.

For the purposes of the SDGs Audit Model, an audit of SDG implementation is defined as a “performance audit that focuses on the achievement of nationally-agreed targets linked to the SDG targets.” It does not focus on entities, projects, programs, or processes. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between the entities, projects, programs, and processes for the achievement of cross-cutting results. The audit methodology presented in the guidebook focuses on the achievement of outcomes while also encouraging audit institutions to mainstream actions for enhancing impact throughout the audit process.

The guidebook includes chapters on how to select topics for audits, how to design an audit of SDG implementation, how to draft a report that has an impact, and how to follow up on the audit. It also includes sections addressing how to audit a government’s efforts related to coherence and integration, multi-stakeholder engagement, efforts to ensure no one is left behind, and policies related to the achievement of a national target.

The ISAM encourages SAIs to focus on the “leave no one behind” principle underlying the 2030 Agenda as a key consideration in defining audits of SDG implementation and throughout the audit process.

The English version of the ISAM was launched on 31 March 2020. It is currently available in English and Spanish. It will be translated into Arabic and French prior to June 2020. The ISAM will be updated based on lessons learned during pilot audits and other feedback.

113,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ffd-forum-highlights-calls-for-debt-standstill/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,FfD Forum Highlights Calls for Debt Standstill,"The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) held its annual Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum) to hear remarks from officials on financing sustainable development in the context of COVID-19. The outcome document of the 2020 Forum was negotiated among Member States through virtual means, and placed under consideration via silence procedure.

Opening the virtual FFD Forum on 23 April 2020, ECOSOC President Mona Juul drew immediate attention to the importance of debt relief. She welcomed:

the Group of 20 (G20) Finance Ministers’ Action Plan calling to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries,

a call by the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,

actions by the Paris Club; and

the call by Pakistan’s Prime Minister for a Global Initiative for Debt Relief, proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt issue and financing for sustainable development.

Also on debt, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 are amplifying existing debt risks. He called for extending the G20’s proposed debt moratorium to all countries that request forbearance, including middle-income countries (MICs) that lose access to financial markets. He said more targeted debt relief also will be needed, and to address sovereign debt restructuring in a way that supports countries in achieving the SDGs.

UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also echoed the importance of debt relief, welcoming the initiatives from the G20, IMF, World Bank, and the Global Initiative for Debt Relief called for by Pakistan.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Board Chair for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization – GAVI, explained that for many vulnerable countries, COVID-19 began as an economic crisis as global demand fell for their export products, including oil and industrial metal. Income from tourism and remittances also fell. “Then the pandemic arrived and the health crisis set in,” she said, and the necessary measures to save lives compounded the economic crisis. She said that in developing countries, 70% of workers are in the informal sector, and for them, lockdowns mean no work, no money, and no food for their families. This “perfect storm” can amount to a food crisis and lead to unrest. She highlighted the proposal for a two-year “debt standstill” as a short-term response, followed by efforts to revamp health systems and make them more resilient.

Another theme of the officials’ remarks was illicit financial flows (IFFs). Juul stressed the need to combat and prevent IFFs, as all sources of finance must be mobilized to address the virus and its social and economic consequences. Muhammad-Bande added that IFFs must be fought so countries can prevent inequalities from deepening.

Speakers also highlighted gender-related impacts of the pandemic crisis. Juul said women both carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, and are overrepresented among frontline health workers. Guterres said the pandemic has shown how economies are sustained by the invisible, unpaid labor of women, and “returning to our previous path is simply not an option.” He said women’s leadership is needed to help avoid catastrophic consequences of economic instability on women and girls.

In a keynote address, Narbada Gumbonzvanda, Board Chair, Action Aid International, outlined Action Aid’s call for a global people’s bailout of at least US$4.6 trillion. Pointing to inequality as “the mother of all pre-existing conditions,” she said we are on the brink of catastrophe because of “the yawning gaps we have tolerated in social and economic rights such as access to healthcare, clean water and rights to decent work.”

Gumbonzvanda reported that two thirds of low-income countries are spending more on debt service payments than on public health care. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only one in five people is covered by any kind of pension, social protection or safety net.

Jay Collins, Citigroup Vice Chairman for Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory, suggested using the COVID-19 crisis to strengthen resolve against climate change, and learn how to manage setbacks. He said the mobilization of trillions of US dollars in capital demonstrates that the world is capable of radical responses in the developed world, but in the developing world, the fight has just begun.

Collins acknowledged that COVID-19 has moved the SDG targets further from reach and made them even more ambitious. However, he identified “silver linings” in investors’ interest in social factors, reporting that: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds are outperforming non-ESG benchmarks; risk models for investment are being reconsidered, giving additional weight to climate value-at-risk and other concepts; and ESG scores for companies are already falling for poor COVID-response behavior.

In a statement on the occasion of the Forum, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said the impacts of the pandemic will be felt across all SDGs and the seven action areas of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD. He said recovery actions must be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and AAAA to ensure that we recover in a more sustainable and resilient way, and the AAAA in particular can act as a roadmap to a more resilient economy in the post-COVID world.

The virtual informal meeting of the Forum served as its fifth annual session, since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD in 2015. The outcome document was negotiated among Member States through virtual means in a process led by the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Latvia, and was placed under silence procedure until 27 April 2020.

Juul said the text, once adopted, will represent the first universal agreement on UN policies to finance immediate response to COVID-19 and longer-term recovery. [Meeting webcast] [UN News story] [Updates from ECOSOC President on outcome document]","Opening the virtual FFD Forum on 23 April 2020, ECOSOC President Mona Juul drew immediate attention to the importance of debt relief.
Also on debt, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 are amplifying existing debt risks.
He said more targeted debt relief also will be needed, and to address sovereign debt restructuring in a way that supports countries in achieving the SDGs.
UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also echoed the importance of debt relief, welcoming the initiatives from the G20, IMF, World Bank, and the Global Initiative for Debt Relief called for by Pakistan.
“Then the pandemic arrived and the health crisis set in,” she said, and the necessary measures to save lives compounded the economic crisis."

Consider blood donation campaigns. In most countries of the world, donating blood is voluntary. To raise donations, governments and health agencies traditionally appeal to social responsibility and a sense of civic solidarity, sometimes even providing incentives.

Imagine instead a scenario where the principal pitch-line of a donation campaign was that it remains a “voluntary” initiative, and citizens can always find “alternative” ways to express their civic responsibility. The likely result would be to discourage the noble action of blood donation.

This resembles the situation we are witnessing with the global SDG indicator framework. Following the most pessimistic declaration to date by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in September 2019, in which it noted with great alarm that the world is “off track” to meeting most of the SDGs, the response by the UN Statistical Commission at its latest session on 3-6 March 2020 was to tepidly “reiterate that the application of the global indicator framework is a voluntary and country-led process and that alternative or complementary indicators for national and subnational levels of monitoring will be developed at national level on the basis of national priorities, realities, capacities and circumstances.”

The SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, measured first and foremost by the global SDG indicators.

Why does the Commission take pains to repeat that the global indicator framework is a voluntary process, and why is it sanctioning the use of alternative indicators?

Importance of Monitoring the Global Indicators

The development and review of the global SDG indicator framework has been an arduous process that has lasted over five years and required the concerted effort of the entire international statistical community. The Commission’s seemingly paradoxical approach of downplaying its importance may be the result of objections from a small number of countries to certain SDG indicators or to their methodological specifications. Rather than tackle this handful of cases head-on, the Commission appears to have preferred portraying the entire SDG indicator framework as less binding, including allowing for “alternative” indicators and continuing to refer to it as “work in progress.”

Nobody is debating the fact the 2030 Agenda as a whole, and the SDG indicators in particular, are a voluntary commitment. But by constantly reiterating the voluntary nature of the global indicator framework, without advocating for its use for the purpose of global monitoring, the UN Statistical Commission – the highest intergovernmental decision-making body in statistics – sends an ambiguous message to countries that risks doing a disservice to the 2030 Agenda.

In our previous article published on this blog, we highlighted how poor SDG data are leading to poor implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s global commitments. In that article, we also suggested a number of pragmatic measures to tackle the huge data gaps, beginning with the need for the UN Statistical Commission to urge countries to monitor the global SDG indicator framework. Unfortunately, when the Commission met in March 2020 for its annual session, it missed this opportunity.

Alternative Indicators, Risky Substitutions

The Commission’s open invitation for countries to use “alternative” indicators may have serious consequences for global SDG reporting. To some readers, the terms alternative and complementary may at first glance appear almost equivalent. However, there is a profound difference between the two. To complement the global indicator framework with regional and/or national indicators means that countries should ostensibly report global indicators as the starting point, yet they are also free to deploy additional indicators for more specific purposes. By contrast, suggesting that “alternative” indicators can be developed effectively gives countries a blank cheque to substitute global indicators with different national indicators.

As we also noted in our previous article, alternative national indicators are invariably incomparable with global indicators, and this directly undermines the principle of mutual accountability on which the 2030 Agenda is built. There are no established criteria or procedures for determining when and how to substitute global indicators with national indicators, which leaves the door open to arbitrary choices. More importantly, when countries do not produce the official global indicators at national level, it becomes impossible to compile regional and global aggregates and thereby gain a sense of the world’s progress towards implementing the SDGs.

By allowing countries to develop “alternative” indicators, the UN Statistical Commission has overlooked associated risks, as well as the sage advice of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the Millennium Development Goal indicators (IAEG-MDG) – the predecessor mechanism to today’s IAEG-SDG. In its seminal report on Lessons Learned from MDG Monitoring from a Statistical Perspective, the IAEG-MDG noted one of the key weaknesses of the MDG monitoring framework was the fact that “discrepancies between national and international data, due to, among others, different methodologies, definitions, different choice of data sources, or time gap in release dates, created problems at the national level and tension in the international statistical community.”

The other challenge with using “alternative” instead of “complementary” indicators is that it may amount to a reinterpretation of UN Resolution 70/1 (by which the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Paragraph 75 states that: “global indicators…will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by Member States.”

The term “alternative” does not figure at all in the 2030 Agenda or its associated UNGA resolution. In introducing this term, with the real and not merely semantic implications explained above, the UN Statistical Commission has set a questionable precedent by blurring the boundaries between the roles of legislator and statistician.

Time is Running Out to Measure SDG Indicators

With a little over ten years left until the end of 2030, and an unenviable track record so far, half-hearted efforts and mixed messages will not get us to the finish line. A bold and unambiguous statement is needed to remind all actors that the SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, which are measured, first and foremost, by the global SDG indicators.

115,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/japan-and-singapore-submit-2020-ndcs/,"Thu, 02 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Japan and Singapore Submit 2020 NDCs,"Japan and Singapore have submitted their 2020 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The 2015 Paris Agreement decision requested parties to communicate every five-years either a new NDC, or an update on their existing one, depending on the respective NDC timeframe. Parties decided that their NDCs would reflect each country’s highest possible ambition, and new NDCs would have to represent a progression from the previous ones.

Since both Japan’s and Singapore’s NDCs have a ten-year timeframe with 2030 as target year, in March 2020 they submitted an update on their first NDCs. Their communication on actions and achievements to date reveal both their approaches and ongoing activities, as well as how they consider their NDCs ambitious and fair in light of their respective national circumstances.

Singapore’s 2020 NDC submission emphasizes that its “updated NDC” reflects the following enhancements:

An expansion of greenhouse gas (GHG) coverage to include nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), a chemical with a high global warming potential that is released in some high-tech industries, such as electronics manufacturing; and

An economy-wide absolute GHG emissions limitation target, in place of the previous intensity target, with a clear peak emission level at 65 MtCO2e around 2030 to achieve a 36% reduction in Emissions Intensity from 2005 levels by 2030.

Reviewing its achievements so far, Singapore highlights that in 2019 it introduced an economy-wide carbon tax, which applies to direct emissions from facilities producing 25 ktCO2e or more GHG emissions in a year, without exemption. This covers 80% of Singapore’s carbon emissions and provides an economy-wide price signal to incentivize and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Singapore’s high population density mean that the risks of nuclear energy outweigh the potential benefits. The NDC describes the country as “alternative energy disadvantaged,” noting that limited land area, relatively flat land, low wind speeds, and lack of geothermal resources present challenges for deploying solar power on a large scale. Still, Singapore is moving ahead to spur the deployment of solar PV through continued investment in “research development and demonstration” in order to reduce cost, improve efficiency, and enable innovative modes of deployment. Singapore reports that it is on track to achieve 350 megawatt-peak in 2020, and aims to achieve at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. This would meet about 4% of Singapore’s current annual electricity needs, and 10% of daily peak electricity demand today.

Singapore notes that took early and ambitious policy measures to reduce GHG emissions, and these account for many of the gains to date:

Singapore switched from fuel oil to natural gas, so that in 2019 about 95% of its electricity was generated from natural gas, compared to 18% in 2000;

Energy is already priced at market cost without any subsidy to incentivize households and businesses to use energy prudently; and

Singapore was among the first to impose a vehicle quota system to cap vehicle growth, and the only country to set a zero-growth rate for cars and motorcycles.

Singapore is also implementing concrete measures that focus on:

For the transport sector: phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles and promoting the adoption of greener vehicles; making public and shared transport and active mobility the preferred mode of travel; and enhancing the environmental friendliness of its transport infrastructure;

For the buildings sector: mandating minimum energy performance standards; and supporting the research and adoption of cost-effective, energy-efficient, and renewable energy solutions; and

For industry: enhancing grant schemes to help companies improve their energy efficiency, and supporting the achievement of systems-level efficiency gains across the sector.

Singapore also provides information on adaptation efforts to address its vulnerabilities as a low-lying island state. These include: investing in research; protecting against sea-level rise; managing water and minimizing floods; keeping essential services running well and buildings and infrastructure safe; strengthening resilience in public health and protecting biodiversity; and ensuring a resilient food supply.

Japan’s 2020 NDC submission does not include an adaptation component, but rather focuses on the country’s mitigation efforts. The document emphasizes that Japan has reduced its GHG emissions by over 8% during fiscal years (FY) 2014 to 2017, while the preliminary figures for FY 2018 indicate approximately 12% cumulative reductions. Japan will continue to aim for a reduction of 26% by FY 2030 compared to FY 2013 (25.4% reduction compared to FY 2005), and pursue further efforts both in the medium-term and long-term to reduce GHG emissions beyond this level.

Japan’s NDC reflects the country’s emphasis on technological and energy efficiency improving measures in relevant production and consumption sectors. These include iron and steel, cement, pulp, and chemical industries as well as commercial, residential, and transport sectors. With regard to the “land use, land-use change, and forestry” sector (LULUCF), Japan promotes forestry industry measures, as well as forest and soil management to increase carbon stock.

Japan notes annual progress reviews of its Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, and states that the review of its reduction target will be carried out with a revision of the energy mix. With regards to energy conversion, Japan informs of: expanding renewable energy introduction; utilizing nuclear power generation whose safety is confirmed; and pursuing high efficiency in thermal power generation.

Having faced a drastic change in its energy circumstances due to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan decided on a new Strategic Energy Plan as a starting point for reviewing and rebuilding the country’s energy strategy from scratch. Japan’s Long-term Strategy under the Paris Agreement, which it submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2019, aims to accomplish a “decarbonized society” as early as possible and as close as possible to 2050. As explained in Japan’s 2020 NDC, the strategy foresees: “disruptive innovations,” such as artificial photosynthesis and other carbon capture, use and storage technologies; and the realization of a hydrogen society. The long-term strategy further informs of the following considerations:

The Japanese energy sector faces a lack of domestic fossil resources such as oil, natural gas, and coal, and is not equipped with international pipelines or interconnections;

There are concerns about Japan’s international competitiveness in terms of high energy costs resulting from increased fossil fuels procurement following the shutdown of domestic nuclear power plants;

Japan will engage with new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplying countries, noting growing LNG exports from the U.S. as well as Russia’s abundant resource potential in the Arctic Circle; and

Decarbonization of gas itself with moderate social costs will be sought using existing LNG / city gas infrastructure and consumer-side equipment.

The submissions from Japan and Singapore bring the total number of 2020 NDCs received to only six of 188 Paris Agreement parties (given the US notification to withdraw by 4 November 2020). Collectively the six countries represent only 2.8% of global emissions, based on data calculations by the World Resources Institute’s Climate Watch. Some insiders have expressed disappointment that most countries missed the informal NDC submission deadline in February 2020.

Based on the Paris Agreement, parties’ efforts are not only communicated in their NDCs but are also subject to various types of review, including: a review of implementation through the Agreement’s enhanced transparency framework; a review of compliance through an implementation and compliance mechanism; and a review of overall progress through a global stocktaking process every five years. It is through this iterative process of submitting and reviewing NDCs that parties to the Paris Agreement envisaged that international community will eventually achieve the Agreement’s long-term objectives.

The first global stocktake occurs in 2023. It is expected to address mitigation, adaptation, and finance.

The brochure titled, ‘Benefits from Implementing a Chemical Management System,’ focuses on benefits related to: the management of industrial chemicals; agricultural pesticides; chemical accidents prevention, preparedness and response; and the establishment of the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs).

The brochure describes the ways in which sound chemicals management contributes to achieving specific SDG targets, namely:

Target 3.9 on reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination;

Target 6.3 on improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials;

Target 9.4 on making infrastructure and industries sustainable;

Target 11.6 on reducing cities’ environmental impacts; and

Target 12.4 on achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes.

In addition, the brochure points to progress and challenges related to the tracking of SDGs with PRTRs. It mentions that the OECD is exploring how PRTR data can be used to undertake analyses, and evaluate and potentially accelerate progress towards meeting relevant SDG targets.



Sound chemicals management also helps implement various chemicals-related MEAs, which were adopted between 1985 and 2013, including: the Minamata Convention on Mercury; the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs); the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC); the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer; and the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.

Participants called for accelerating the region’s progress to support the Decade of Action and Delivery.

Over 300 stakeholders participated in the virtual meeting, which convened on 19 March. UNECE originally planned to hold a one- and a half day Forum with 15 sessions and a focus on peer learning. In response to the COVID-10 pandemic, UNECE changed the conference to an entirely virtual meeting. Special webinars focused on solutions to challenges in delivering on the SDGs and the importance of gender-responsive standards, policy coherence and reliable statistics. A virtual Civil Society Meeting, which coordinated the inputs of over 150 civil society partners across the region, preceded the Forum.

In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed said “we have not yet seen the broad and deep transformative change that the 2030 Agenda requires.” She stressed, “there is no denying that we have a mountain to climb over the coming decade” and emphasized a sense of urgency for all regional fora for the SDGs.

UNECE presented the findings of a first regional report on SDG progress, which finds “some good progress and many gaps” on the way to transformative change in the UNECE region. The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators and finds increased ambition is needed to meet environmental targets. The Forum also discussed how Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) contribute to realizing the SDGs in the region.

Countries shared concrete actions to accelerate SDG progress and advance green and inclusive change, such as the UNECE Trees in the Cities Challenge. European Commission (EC) representative, Luca Marmo, presented the European Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan. Finland shared its strategy to become carbon neutral by 2035, and Denmark highlighted its Youth Climate Advisory Council as a channel for youth engagement in Denmark.

Alongside calls for accelerating SDG efforts, participants recognized the need for solidarity and multilateralism, given the COVID-19 pandemic. The vice president of the European Youth Council, Tina Hočevar, said “we can beat this crisis and we can beat the climate crisis” with rationality and solidarity. UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova welcomed the region’s “coordinated solutions to common problems,” underscoring the importance of working together to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and leave no one behind.

The brief, which was released in April 2020, explains that, while SAICM has m­­­ade significant progress regarding strengthening capacity, commitment, technical knowledge, and political will to implement and mainstream chemicals into national planning, its objectives and 2020 goal to minimize the adverse impacts of chemicals and waste will not be achieved.

More ambitious action is needed, and the brief describes progress made and considerations in moving beyond 2020 related to:

reducing the widening gap between countries;

inspiring political will to act at national levels;

sharing knowledge and information;

securing stable finances and resources;

strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure;

improving the monitoring framework to assess progress; and

addressing emerging policy issues (EPIs).

On reducing inequality between developed and developing countries and addressing human rights issues, the brief emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable and marginalized groups from chemicals exposure at work, in the home and in the environment, including through the provision of technical infrastructure, such as poison centers, and strengthened collaboration between actors in chemicals management and human rights focusing on gendered impacts of exposure and childhood exposure.



Regarding inspiring political will, considerations in moving beyond 2020 include, among others: building National Focal Point (NFP) capacity so they can fulfill mandates and encourage stakeholder buy-in and mobilization of resources; increasing ownership of SAICM to encourage implementation of the integrated approach to financing; and improving representation of health, agriculture, finance, and other relevant sectors to support national efforts to mainstream SAICM across departments.



Regarding sharing knowledge and information, the brief mentions: establishing a global system to share and fill information gaps on hazardous chemicals and waste; and creating a scientific forum with the potential to develop internationally agreed methodologies for risk and hazard assessment.



On securing stable finances and resources, the policy brief underlines the need to: mainstream SAICM’s strategic objectives into national development plans and budgets; and utilize economic instruments, such as the ‘polluter pays principle,’ to address externalities resulting from chemicals production, use and disposal.



On strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure, recommendations include enhancing linkages and collaboration between sectors to support efforts to mainstream SAICM across government departments and create linkages to each country-level UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.



The document also discusses improving the monitoring framework to assess progress by strengthening linkages to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic and Time-bound) indicators to complement or replace existing indicators.

On emerging policy issues (EPIs), recommendations include recognizing ‘highly hazardous pesticides’ as an EPI, and agreeing on the most suitable testing regime for endocrine disrupting chemicals.

119,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/dag-hammarskjold-foundation-paints-picture-on-art-of-un-leadership/,"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation Paints Picture on Art of UN Leadership,"A publication by the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation on leadership aims to stimulate the conversation on how UN leadership culture, policies and practices can be enhanced to ensure the UN’s relevance and strengthen its impact—particularly at a time when the multilateralism is being tested.

The forward, by Henrik Hammargren, notes that defining “leadership” can be a difficult task, but identifies four characteristics: 1) that it can be both constructive and destructive and therefore must be scrutinized; 2) that it should not be condensed to a particular set of skills; 3) that it is often confused with—or reduced to—management capability; and 4) that the public discourse is too narrowly-focused on the individual, and should also recognize collective responsibility and action.

Making the case for the relevance of UN leadership in the current context, the report offers five precepts that provide a framing for 26 written contributions:

The responsibility of the UN and its mandate: leaders in the UN must act in the midst of—and in response to—endemic poverty, climate change, armed conflicts and human rights violations, and uphold the UN charter in the face of resistance The recognition that no one has a monopoly of knowledge over ‘leadership’: the voices and viewpoints expressed by the individual thoughtpieces differ, each offering their own perspective The relationship between leadership and management: noting the above caveat, leadership encompasses management, but the latter can be taught, learned or otherwise implemented, whereas leadership builds on a variety of other traits spanning ethics, integrity and courage Leadership is not just at the top: leadership is to be sought, enabled and nurtured at all levels of the organization, across a wide range of professional profiles Anchoring decisions in today’s realities: recognizing that past inspirations regularly surface, the report avoids a “golden age” or “what would Hammarskjöld have done” sentimentality, recalling his words that, “Your duty, your reward – your destiny – are here and now.”

The report organizes contributions beginning with a broad exploration of what principled leadership at the UN entails, and how leadership can build consensus to address global challenges and strengthen multilateralism. The second chapter describes lessons learned from, and attributes of, individual leaders, featuring inspirational stories and an exploration of the question, “who would you want to work for?” The report’s third chapter explores the institutional role of UN leadership in coalition-building, the relevance of feminist leadership to the UN, and the relationships between innovation and leadership. The final chapter takes stock of current leadership initiatives undertaken in the wake of the adoption of the UN System Leadership Framework, and utilizes data related to UN human resources functions to revisit past assumptions and review “unexamined symptoms of ailing leadership.”

Better leadership is essential not only for ensuring trust in the UN—and in multilateralism more broadly—but also for effectively responding to today’s global challenges, the report argues. It highlights a tension between realism and idealism, where leaders must uphold universal values and principles, but also must hold governments and people to account, which involves a unique set of risks and pressures. These pressures, the report recognizes, demand that a leader demonstrate grit and courage, but also humility, compassion and empathy.

The report concludes with three emergent learnings: for leadership to grow, failures must be recognized and discussed; further stock must be taken on the UN Leadership Framework’s implementation across a fragmented UN system; and if the UN is to be impactful beyond New York or Geneva, reflections on leadership must be shared beyond these spheres, going past inward-looking perspectives to include external experiences and stakeholders.

The publication’s focus on UN leadership derives from three factors: 1) the UN reform process, of which strengthening leadership features as a core pillar; 2) turbulence, where the UN is being questioned and having its contributions and budgets reduced; and 3) historical, as 2019 marked the “centennial anniversary of the international civil servant” and the founding of the League of nations. Additionally, this September will feature a celebration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, a key theme of which will be multilateralism.

These pressures, the report recognizes, demand that a leader demonstrate grit and courage, but also humility, compassion and empathy.
Additionally, this September will feature a celebration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, a key theme of which will be multilateralism.

As part of our Mission Possible campaign, edie brings you this weekly round-up of five of the best sustainability success stories of the week from across the globe.

Published every week, the new series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their 'Mission Possible' across the campaign's five key pillars - energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and business leadership.

Despite the economic shockwaves being felt globally as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, projects and initiatives which empower businesses to play their part in achieving a sustainable future, today, are continuing to launch and scale-up.

ENERGY: Albion Capital refinances £105m renewables portfolio

Albion Capital confirmed this week that it has completed the refinancing of Albion Community Power, the £105m renewable energy portfolio consisting of wind, hydro, solar and battery storage projects have been partially delivered through Feed-in Tariffs and Renewable Obligation Certificates.

Albion Capital raised £57m of debt across the portfolio, delivering returns of 15-20% for shareholders. The company has now raised and deployed over £250m in the UK renewables sector over the last decade.

David Gudgin, partner at Albion Capital, said: “Albion Community Power introduced institutional investors to the Albion brand for the first time, and we are pleased to have delivered such a good result for our shareholders. Moving forward, the ACP fund continues to invest in renewable energy assets and we are keen to add further institutional investors targeting long term, uncorrelated, RPI-linked cash flows alongside our existing LPs.”

MOBILITY: Renault to only make EVs on Chinese Market

Renault has this week confirmed that it will end the production of traditional combustion engine vehicles in China. The move means that Renault will only produce electric vehicles (EVs) on the Chinese Market.

While the move has been welcomed, PwC studies not that 825,527 EVs were sold in China in 2019, compared to 286,330 EVs across the five largest EU countries, Norway and the Netherlands. In response, the European Wildlife conservation organisation called on the automaker to take the same step on the domestic European market.

“Currently, tens of thousands of people are dying of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, partially due to the smog to which combustion engines contribute. It is precisely for this reason that Europe needs similarly bold action from carmakers, just like Renault in China. Carmakers in Europe are also lagging behind because Covid-19 has substantially worse consequences in European countries than it had in China,” said Director Dalibor Dostal of European Wildlife.

BUILT ENVIRONMENT: The Greenhouses producing low-carbon tomatoes

Low Carbon Farming is currently developing two wastewater-heated greenhouses in East Anglia and now plans to roll-out the infrastructure nationwide. The two current projects will cost £120m and are expected to create 360 new jobs, rising to 480 in high season. But Low Carbon Farming believes that a nationwide expansion of 41 greenhouses could create more than 8,000 new jobs, deliver £2.67bn into regional economies and increase the UK’s clean heat output by almost 3TWh per annum.

The greenhouses use heat pumps to capture waste heat from nearby water recycling centres and together cover 29 hectares of indoor growing space. The greenhouses use hydroponic growing systems that will use 10 times less water while increasing British tomato production by 12%. The associated carbon emissions will also be 75% lower than conventional measures.

Low Carbon Farming’s director Andy Allen said: “Our East Anglian projects provide British farming with a bankable template for the nationwide roll-out of transformative, renewable heat solutions. Having secured the financing and proven the business model, and with the case for secure and sustainable British produce having been thrown into such sharp focus, it’s time to plan for the next stage.”

RESOURCES: HP’s latest ocean plastics workbook

Last year, HP pledged to increase recycled content plastic in its Personal Systems and Print hardware and supplies to 30% by 2025. As part of this commitment, HP will continue to incorporate ocean-bound plastic materials into its products. The company has already sourced approximately 700,000 pounds of ocean-bound plastic materials—or more than 25 million bottles—upcycling this material into HP cartridges and hardware.

This week, HP unveiled the ZBook Create, the world's first mobile workstation with ocean-bound plastic. The company has also unveiled a “Studio” notebook that is also made of ocean-bound plastics. Separately, HP has been recognised by UL for achieving levels of recycled content across five of their resins. The resins contain between 5-99% recycled content from ocean-bound plastics.

“As we continue learning how to adapt to new ways of working and learning during these unprecedented times, one thing remains constant – everyone is a creator and needs the right tools to bring their creations to life,” HP’s personal systems president Alex Cho said.

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP: BlackRock launches SDG-focused investor fund

BlackRock is the world’s largest investor, manages $50bn in solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and has recently reiterated its decision to cut investment from companies failing to act on climate change or disclose relevant data.

This week, BlackRock has unveiled its Global Impact fund, which enables investors to funnel finance towards companies that are supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, businesses that addressing access to education and affordable housing, focusing on healthcare and combatting climate change and environmental degradation could all be the focus of new green finance streams.

Rachel Lord, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa for BlackRock comments: “While launching the Global Impact Fund during a global pandemic is coincidental, it does highlight that the opportunity inherent in investing in companies committed to doing good is enduring, and is of increasing relevance to the world today.”

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

The decision was taken due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic “makes holding an ambitious, inclusive” COP in November 2020 no longer possible. The annual climate change conference brings together over 20,000 representatives from government, international and non-governmental organizations, business, and media around the world.

Among the items expected to be on the agenda at COP 26 are issues that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference did not resolve in December 2019. These issues include guidance for Article 6 (market and non-market mechanisms), common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and report of the Consultative Group of Experts. The UNFCCC subsidiary bodies were expected to resume discussion on these issues during their meetings in June 2020 in Bonn, Germany; these meetings have been tentatively rescheduled for October 2020.

In the announcement regarding the postponement, COP 26 President-Designate and UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma emphasized that countries are currently “focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting COVID-19.” Sharma added that he would continue to work with partners to “deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis”.

COP 26 is still expected to take place in Glasgow, UK, hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy. Dates for the rescheduled conference “will be set out in due course following further discussion with parties,” per the UK’s announcement.

In 2020, to mark its 75th anniversary, the United Nations have initiated UN75, the largest and most inclusive global conversation on how to build a better future.

The initiative intends to map out what works and what doesn’t within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. When calling for global participation in the conversation, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remarked that no country can solve the complex global challenges on its own. Participation is pivotal to shaping the future we want.

And 2020 will be a year of great importance: there are just 10 years left to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda.

The goals, adopted by all countries in 2015, constitute a universal roadmap for the world and represent a shared commitment for people, planet and prosperity. Among its key aims, the 2030 Agenda includes bringing to life a low-carbon, climate-smart economy, ending extreme poverty and hunger, and promoting peace, just societies and gender equality. All of which must be accomplished within the next decade.

Doing so necessitates concrete action to be taken now to safeguard the progress made over the past five years.

To deliver on the 2030 Agenda, stakeholders, stretching across sectors, societies and countries, require greater mobilisation — a point made by UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J Mohammed, when briefing Member States on the Decade of Action in late 2019. She acknowledged that “game-changing transformation” has yet to occur. Gender inequality, the climate crisis, poverty and hunger, corruption and numerous other obstacles still haunt and hinder us.

Unpacking the Decade of Action

Under the umbrella of the Decade of Action, the UN has identified three action points: mobilisation, ambition and concrete solutions. Governments and other actors need to showcase good practices and address their failures.

These three action points resonate with the SDG Lab at UN Geneva, and strike at the chord of the Lab’s DNA. As a relative newcomer in the sustainable development space, the Lab acts by serving as a connector, an amplifier, a question-asker and an innovator.

The SDG Lab’s role

The SDG Lab leverages the convening power of the UN. It brings together governments, actors from the UN system, civil society, academia and the private sector, and offers a neutral space to advance the SDGs. The role of the Lab is increasingly relevant in disseminating SDG solutions.

Among the key initiatives that the Lab has spearheaded is its work in connecting the expertise and resources of the finance and development communities. Development finance is taking a new turn. More investors are looking to drive capital for impact, and to integrate social and environmental aspects into their investment processes. Both communities acknowledge that much more can be achieved together than separately.

New sustainable finance projects have been developed in the Geneva ecosystem. One such project is the “Pipeline Builder” that aims to bridge the need for investment at country level with actors who want to drive more capital for greater impact. Another concept that is being explored is an initiative that would facilitate SDG financing by strategically utilising public and philanthropic capital to incentivise the mobilisation of additional private finance.

Bridges for sustainable finance

In 2019, the SDG Lab, together with 50 partners, held Switzerland’s first-ever Building Bridges Week (buildingbridgesweek.ch). The event’s ambition was to help influential financial players gain exposure to sustainable development and insight into impactful investments.

The Week also tapped into the growing fatigue with the “business as usual” attitude. Many citizens have pressing demands for new investment models aligned with the 2030 Agenda. They want to see their money make a difference, as well as financial returns.

In the spirit of the Decade of Action, initiatives such as these help to mobilise the SDG actors of international Geneva and beyond, boost ambitions and provide SDG solutions.

In line with the momentum of UN75, the SDG Lab will continue to do its part to accelerate implementation of the goals.

According to the fund giant, which came under the spotlight last year over its engagement with climate issues, the high conviction equity strategy gives investors access to businesses that are “helping to address major world challenges”, and that are advancing the UN’s ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs).

The portfolio focuses on a broad spread of themes including access to quality education and affordable housing, and developing healthcare innovation to help with societal challenges such as the current Covid-19 pandemic which has caused over 130,000 deaths worldwide at the time of writing.

The actively managed fund will also search for growth in firms that are pushing for financial and digital inclusion, preventing climate change, reversing environmental degradation, and increasing efficiencies in water usage and deployment, the US asset manager said in a statement.

According to portfolio manager and head of active equities impact investing, Eric Rice, who joined BlackRock last year, impact investing is becoming more popular as investors ""increasingly require their investment targets to advance their sustainability objectives"".

“Launching the fund during the Covid-19 pandemic has further highlighted the important role companies play in society. Covid-19 is one of the greatest societal challenges the world faces right now, and we see impact investing playing a meaningful role in how we overcome it,” he said.

He added that capital from the fund will be invested in companies focused on medical diagnostic tools and vaccines to combat the coronavirus crisis, as well as ""crisis mass notification systems"" and microloans.

SDGs, a collection of 17 global goals, were set in 2015 by the UN with the intention of creating a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”.

Life is difficult right now – there’s no way to sugar coat it! We’re modifying our behaviours, adjusting our routines and giving up time with our loved ones. The pay off should be worth it, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard.

In difficult times, hearing heartwarming stories can provide us with an extra boost of positivity. Everyone is looking for ways to stay positive and to help make things just a little easier for their loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, etc. I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

There have been a lot of stories of individuals and organizations using their 3D printers to provide protective equipment to healthcare workers – within days of closing, Library staff were involved in testing these types of printing projects for Glengarry Memorial Hospital.

Since that first week, staff have been working to print face shields and most recently, mask straps. The face shields are still in progress, as the print jobs originally took nine hours and finding the clear plastic is difficult to source. The library has arranged to have their shields available to GMH staff as a back up should they run out of their supply of protective equipment. Thankfully, there has been no need for that yet.

The mask straps, designed to relieve the pressure on the ears from wearing a face mask for extended periods of time, were delivered to extremely grateful hospital staff last week.

We’re proud that we are able to use our equipment to provide support to our brave healthcare workers. Printing these items has been a real team effort, involving numerous staff to make it happen. Library staff continue to demonstrate that we are a resourceful bunch – and we’re ready to respond to any needs we can during this difficult time.","I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

The flat portions of the rails are longer than others to help nail your seat position. This is a super nice detail for taller riders who often end up with slack effective seat-tube angles once their saddle height is correct. More adjustability is a big help for them.

Some SDG fairs already cancelled due to COVID-19 Back to video “I think this is the first time it’s been cancelled,” said Steve Rolland, president of the Maxville Fair’s board of directors. “It was a very hard decision to take. All the directors voted on it through email because we couldn’t get together.” During an interview with the Standard-Freeholder, Rolland said the difficult decision was made in order to protect local residents who take part in the fair. “We actually start planning the fair before April,” Rolland said. “That’s why we took the decision to cancel it this year. This whole pandemic doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Our fair is based on our community.

We’re not sure how this is going to affect next year’s fair, but hopefully the sponsors and everyone else understand.” The Avonmore Fair also recently announced its board of directors had taken the decision to cancel this year’s edition. This year’s fair would’ve taken place in July and would’ve marked the 160th anniversary of the event. “The decision to cancel our fair, like many fair boards are having to consider, was not an easy one,” read a statement on the fair’s website. “2020 marks our 160th year and we were excited to share it with you. Instead, we will celebrate it at our fair in 2021. We appreciate the hard work of our volunteers, as well as the support of our community and we are looking forward to the 2021 Avonmore Fair.” The president of the Williamstown Fair said its board had not yet made up his mind regarding the possible cancellation of the event. Williamstown is the longest-running fair in Ontario, spanning over 200 years. This year, it is slated to take place from Aug. 7-9. “While preparations have started, we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic situation at this time,” said president Mike Seguin. “We know that some people are wondering whether there will be a fair this summer. Although it is not business as usual, we believe that it is premature to make a decision on the fate of this year’s fair.

Article content Hospitals in SDG and Prescott-Russell have about a week to a 10 days’ worth of personal protective equipment before they run out. Eastern Ontario Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis confirmed this Monday, saying unless the region received a massive supply of equipment within the next few days, local hospitals could be forced to decontaminate masks and reuse them.

SDG/Prescott-Russell to run out of PPE within 10 days: EOHU Back to video “We’re also being told that any day now we should be receiving a massive supply, so were crossing our fingers,” Roumeliotis said during Monday’s teleconference briefing. “At this point it’s either we decontaminate it and reuse it, or we get a big supply.” According to Roumeliotis, directives to decontaminate and reuse the equipment stemmed from both federal and provincial governments. “Medical-grade facemasks should be reserved only for healthcare providers,” he said. “Healthcare providers use those to protect themselves and to protect their patients.”

Roumeliotis still could not give an exact number when asked how many ventilators were in the Prescott-Russell and SDG area, citing that he did not have enough time to look it up. “I don’t have those numbers,” he said. “I’ve just had so many things to do.” Fifth centre opens

Five testing centres are now up and running in the EOHU area — Casselman, Hawkesbury, Winchester, Cornwall and Rockland, which opened its doors on Monday. Roumeliotis outlined there was the potential to open one in Alexandria, if needed. In total, the SDG and Prescott-Russell areas have 44 confirmed cases, with three of them currently in intensive care unit (ICU) and two in a non-ICU setting. Of the five hospitalized cases for the area, three are housed in the Cornwall Community Hospital — with two of them being in ICU. “They are all in stable condition,” answered Roumeliotis when asked about them. “There were rumours that there was a death due to the virus in the area. At this point, we haven’t had any reports of death related to COVID. So far, we haven’t had any deaths.” More On This Topic Eastern Ontario Health Unit now at 42 local cases of COVID-19 EOHU now at 34 cases, including first youth Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Data unveiled by the province on Monday outlined that of the 44 local cases, three have now been classified as resolved. Of those who tested positive, 22 are women and 24 are men. Only one case is reported as being under the age of 20. Three are in the 20s, eight in their 30s, four are in their 40s, 14 are in their 50s, 13 are in their 60s and two are in their 70s. One person’s age is labelled by the province as unknown.

Roumeliotis expressed once again that residents should not visit family members during the pandemic — especially during the upcoming Easter weekend. “Again, I urge everybody, please don’t get together with your families,” he said. “I know that for many it’s an important religious holiday, but it’s really important, particularly over the next week or two, that we stay at home, that we don’t gather and that we don’t go see grandma. “It’s well worth doing phone calls or getting together virtually to protect the most vulnerable in our community.” He also said the number of confirmed cases seems to have slowed down recently. “There’s a bit of a peak between March 14 and March 26,” said Roumeliotis. “We had about five to six new cases on a daily basis. Now it has sort of gone down. We’re looking at keeping that low and we’re going to be monitoring very closely.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine Resources: Ontario’s COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool

Roumeliotis leads 2019 Sunshine List for Cornwall/SDG

Article content This article was edited in order to correct the amount Geoff Clarke earned in 2018 – $160,059. Ontario’s 2019 Sunshine List was unveiled on March 27 and with it, information on most local top earners. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Roumeliotis leads 2019 Sunshine List for Cornwall/SDG Back to video Leading the pack at the City of Cornwall level is chief administrative officer (CAO) Maureen Adams, who made $219,383 in 2019. That compared to a wage of $205,968 in 2018. Cornwall’s general manager of planning, development and recreation Mark Boileau, was the second-highest local municipal earner, making $164,424, as opposed to $161,582 he made in 2018.

Cornwall’s manager of employee relations Bruce Donig, earned $138,721 in 2019, whereas he earned $134,156 in 2018.

Article content The 2019 list revealed some of Cornwall’s top earners, such as Adams, Clarke and Bailey, received an increase to their salaries that was higher than the 1.9 per cent provided to the employees represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees in 2019. Management wage increases are often tied to what the city’s unionized workers receive. According to Clarke, the management salary grid also echoes the one in union agreements. Which means, not just the annual cost-of-living bump, but also additional pay after a certain amount of time on the job. “We give everybody the same increase as the union had,” he told the Standard-Freeholder. “The increases you see are promotional grid steps. If I make $20 this year and my next step is $22, but it’s a 1.9 per cent increase, it’s $22 plus the 1.9 per cent increase. “What you see is somebody progressing through their pay band.” More On This Topic Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Cornwall/SDG 2018 Sunshine list The 2019 sunshine list also featured several members of the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the Cornwall Fire Services. Cornwall Police Chief Danny Aikman topped the list for first responders, earning $206,095 last year, as opposed to $183,346 in 2018. The 2019 year was his first full year as chief of police, the difference in earning reflecting his promotion. Another promoted officer, Deputy Chief Shawna Spowart, earned $173,226 in 2019, whereas she had made $151,872 in 2018.

Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Supplied

Article content A breakdown of information on local cases that many have been calling for since April 2 arrived Wednesday afternoon on the Eastern Ontario Health Unit website. Of 61 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, a multi-coloured map indicated 36 have been in Prescott-Russell, 15 in SDG and 10 in Cornwall, the numbers as of noon on Wednesday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Back to video That Prescott-Russell has the highest number does not come as a surprise to Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, the medical officer of health who in his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon said that county has 92,000 residents – more than twice the population of Cornwall, and about 28,000 more than in SDG – many living in close proximity to Ottawa, where COVID-19 has been very prevalent. “Many people who live in Prescott-Russell work in Ottawa,” the doctor said. The website presentation has several graphs and statistics, the EOHU saying it’s the most accurate information available from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS).

Article content Of the 61 cases, five people currently are hospitalized, with three in ICU. There’ve been 34 patients who’ve recovered. The latest release in the Ontario data indicated no increase in local positive cases between Monday and Tuesday, the number still at 61. Provincial data indicates three more cases are considered resolved, for a total of 45 in that category, although the total is different from the aforementioned EOHU data. Other information provided Wednesday by Roumeliotis included the two local cases involving health-care workers, who work in Ottawa. One was disclosed on March 22, a man in his 30s from Prescott-Russell who works at one of the campuses of the Ottawa Hospital. Nothing has been released about the other. Roumeliotis indicated there have not been any outbreaks at any long-term care facilities or retirement residences. More On This Topic Geographic COVID-19 case location information returning: EOHU EOHU data updated Monday indicates 60 COVID-19 cases Province and EOHU showing different, changing COVID-19 data Responding to a question as to whether he believes schools could be open later this spring, possibly in June, the doctor said “I’m not sure, it’s hard to say.” He said that with the province’s emergency measures extended into mid-May, and with it unknown as to whether it would be further extended, or what size of gatherings would be permitted, it would be “touch and go” as to whether kids would physically be back in school this spring.

Article content Roumeliotis said he expects there’ll be eventually a gradual progression in the loosening of social measures, including larger crowd sizes, but that “I don’t believe we’ll be in a state of normalcy before the late fall, and maybe not until the early winter.” Asked if there could be an emergency curfew put in place, as is the case in Akwesasne, Roumeliotis said it’s a possibility, if physical distancing and other measures weren’t being followed, and the number of COVID-19 cases began rising to the point it overwhelmed hospitals. “(A curfew is) on the table, it’s something we’ve discussed as our next step (aimed at) curtailing gatherings,” he said. “If we feel that measures need to be taken, they’ll be taken.” Roumeliotis said the number of tests done at assessment centres in the region is at just about the 800 mark. The breakdown is as follows: Hawkesbury 292; Cornwall 198; Casselman 165; Rockland 90; Winchester 51. The doctor said about half of the tests have results that are known, and that those still pending should have results come in “in the next day or so.” One graph on the EOHU website for cumulative total confirmed cases in the region, after having an upward curve for most of mid-March into early April, has levelled off over the last handful of days. Responding to whether he expects another surge, Roumeliotis said “it’s hard to say, (but) I hope not. I think what we are trying to do now is level it off. . . we’re having the odd case here, a case there, but it’s a manageable number. Our hospitals are indeed still coping.”

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

137,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/countries-preparing-for-unea-5-stockholm50/,"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Countries Preparing for UNEA-5, Stockholm+50","The UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Committee of Permanent Representatives held a virtual meeting to “continue the business of environmental governance.” The Committee discussed plans for the fifth UNEA session, which is scheduled to take place in February 2021. They also agreed on UNEA’s input to the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and considered the way forward on the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, in 2022.

At the 150th meeting of the CPR on 30 April 2020, the UNEP Secretariat updated the CPR on preparations for UNEA-5. The session will have the theme, ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ It is expected to convene in Nairobi, Kenya, from 22-26 February 2021.

The Secretariat described the session’s expected strategic and thematic elements, which include:

Agreement by the multilateral community on four areas for transformative action for nature to achieve the SDGs: Action area 1: Nature for Jobs and Economic Prosperity Action area 2: Nature for Health Action area 3: Nature for Climate Action area 4: Nature for Sustainable Food Systems

The importance of communication to citizens, and plans for the ‘Actions #ForNature’ campaign that blends the World Environment Day ‘Time #ForNature’ campaign with the UNEA theme; and

The relevance of the UNEA-5 theme in the era of COVID-19, in light of the need for urgent, transformative, and sustained actions to “deliberately reshape humanity’s interaction with nature,” including by re-building economies in ways that address systemic threats to nature (e.g. unsustainable consumption and production, rapid urbanization, weaknesses in governance and accountability).

Committee members pointed to UNEA-5 as an opportunity to provide global political leadership towards a sustainable recovery post COVID-19 and to other global sustainable development processes, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such as by centering COVID-19 recovery plans around investments in nature and green jobs, sustainable finance, sound chemicals management, and sustainable production and consumption.

Ahead of the July 2020 session of the HLPF, the CPR agreed to submit the UNEA input developed through remote negotiations and silence procedure. The input to HLPF reports that: “January 2020 was the hottest month of January ever recorded, one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years and air pollution kills millions of people every year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that the world is currently facing, and its immediate aftermath, are likely to place additional strains on the environment.” Moreover, “the climate, biodiversity and chemicals crises have not disappeared [and] the world can ill-afford delays in key environment-related decision-making and investment.”

The UNEA recommends that the 2020 HLPF, among other items:

call for ambition in the 2020 environmental negotiations whose success will be crucial for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda including the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the international sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020;

stress that COVID-19 does not provide a “silver lining” for the environment but offers an opportunity for rebuilding the world better through green and sustainable recovery efforts, sound management of hazardous medical, and chemical waste and a clear commitment to “building back better”;

recognize the role of regional level coordination as key to address transboundary issues and facilitate regionally coherent approaches; and

acknowledge the request made to the UNEP Executive Director to develop a global environmental data strategy by 2025 and ask other UN entities to contribute to the strategy.

On commemorating the 50th anniversary of UNEP, in 2022, the Committee discussed Sweden’s offer to host a high-level political meeting in Stockholm to commemorate the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment. The CPR asked the UNEA secretariat to prepare a report on substantive aspects of preparations for the 50th anniversary.

In his statement to the 150th meeting, CPR Chair Fernando Coimbra (Brazil) said “the environmental agenda remains one of our most powerful insurance policies in preventing future global pandemics like COVID-19.” He added, “we have learnt the hard way that environmental protection is not a luxury,” but essential for growth and protection of vulnerable populations.

He highlighted that the COVID-19 medical emergency is resulting in a rapid increase in medical and hazardous waste. The UNEP framework ‘Towards a Pollution-Free Planet’ agreed at UNEA-4 provides support for Member States to address capacity gaps in medical waste systems in order to minimize possible secondary impacts on health and the environment.

The Chair also recalled that a “prescient” UNEP report from 2016 found that 60% of all known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. In other words, COVID-19 is just one of many diseases now known to have crossed between animals and humans. Currently, he said, UNEP is mapping the links between deteriorating ecosystem health, habitat and biodiversity loss, and over-exploitation of species. This will allow for policies to interrupt the zoonotic transmission pathways and provide “safe operating space” for nature, to prevent future pandemics.

Coimbra stressed that an ambitious, measurable and inclusive Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as The Beyond 2020 Chemicals and Waste Management Framework, because both play a central role in keeping nature intact, diverse and flourishing. Finally, he said the postponement of the next UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) is as an opportunity to strengthen NDCs by incorporating recovery efforts and climate-friendly investments to stimulate economies, build resilience, and create green and sustainable job opportunities.

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) will coordinate the UN teams in 162 countries and territories. The teams will activate the recovery plan over 12-18 months.

Health and humanitarian funds and strategies to manage pandemic impacts were launched in March, followed by the establishment of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund and a report serving as a call to action, titled, ‘Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.’

As he launched the Fund and Report, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs must be used as a road map to enable the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis to “lead to a different economy” – more equal, inclusive and sustainable, to be more resilient to pandemics, climate change, and other global challenges.

The number of people suffering hunger has increased, climate change is occurring faster than predicted, and inequality is increasing within and among countries, António Guterres says in his ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ 2020 report.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched four years ago to address the most pressing global needs for a sustainable future, including education and health improvements and reductions in social and economic inequalities.

“I think [food price rises are] probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before. It’s like having an emergency in every single country.” Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy, WFP

“The effects of the pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact have overwhelmed the health systems globally, caused businesses and factories to shut down and severely impacted the livelihoods of half of the global workforce,” he says in the report.

It comes on top of an existing slowing in progress towards many of the SDGs, and Guterres had launched a Decade of Action in September to turn things around.

The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The report has been released ahead of UN Economic and Social Council high-level meetings scheduled for July to provide a global, data-driven overview of the SDGs.

Women and girls

Last year’s report had already warned that there was “simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls”.

In the 2020 review, Guterres says “the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled”.

Only half of the world’s women who are married or ‘in-union’ make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, based on 2007-2018 data from 57 countries, the report says.

Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.

More than 260 million children were out of school in 2017 and 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in 2018.

As of 2019, less than half of primary and lower secondary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, computers, the internet and basic handwashing facilities, the report states.

Billions of people worldwide still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, including 2.2 billion people without safe drinking water.

And, the world is projected to miss the target to end poverty in all its forms as hunger increased for the fourth consecutive year and about 50 million children experienced acute undernutrition. Globally, 144 million children under five were still affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters of these children in Central and Southern Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.

Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

“The SDGs reflected the political will of the time,” she says. “Today, in the midst of this pandemic, I think it’s safe to say global political will is in short supply.”

Food crisis

Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in institutions and development at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), says he is sceptical of suggestions in the report that progress has been made on poverty, because the quality of data from national governments has become worse.

He says that wage protections and labour rights need to be made into political issues to ensure they stay on governments’ radars.

“COVID-19 is going to make questions of hunger much worse,” Sinha says. “People are talking about a global response in terms of a vaccine, I think we should pay attention to those who are talking about a global response to the coming food crisis.”

The SDG progress report comes after the United Nations predicted last week that the COVID-19 crisis could push 130 million more people into poverty in the next 10 years.

About 35 million people are expected to fall below the extreme poverty line this year as a result of the pandemic, with 56 per cent of them in Africa, the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2020 report predicted.

The global economy is forecast to lose a staggering US$8.5 trillion in production over the next two years due to the pandemic, the UN report says.

This is a “tremendous setback” for sustainable development, Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, told SciDev.Net.

“[The pandemic] is particularly affecting the more vulnerable groups … because these are the ones whose activities generally require some form of physical proximity to others.”

Remittances

Remittances from migrant workers in the global North could face a hit – in countries such as Haiti, South Sudan and Tonga, remittances constitute more than a third of gross domestic product.

“You have an abrupt cut of people’s livelihoods and incomes, and then you’ve got different kinds of cascading effects through the bigger food system,” says Sophia Murphy, senior specialist in agriculture, trade and investment at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

There are also fears about what the pandemic could mean for long-term food security, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) estimating that 130 million more people in low- and middle-income countries may be pushed into acute food insecurity this year.

Bumper crops in some regions are at risk of being wasted. India has been hit by COVID-19 at harvest time, with crops left unpicked and difficulties getting grain to market for sale before it spoils.

This comes after rising hunger in the three years to 2018 pushed undernourishment back to levels seen around 2010.

Evidence of price rises has already emerged. In Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo, the WFP notes a 10 per cent surge in the price of a typical local basket of food – comprising fish, pulses, peanut paste, cassava flour, oil and condiments – in the space of two weeks.

The organisation expects food price rises to occur more widely, as this is happening in countries such as Syria, where prices have more than doubled in the past year.

“I think it’s probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before,” says Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy at the WFP’s London office.

“It’s like having an emergency in every single country that you’re working in.”

Some countries are already reeling from other problems, such as the locust swarms in East Africa, leading to potentially “devastating” impacts, she adds.","The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

140,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-charts-businesses-path-through-covid-19-crisis/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ITC Charts Businesses’ Path Through COVID-19 Crisis,"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a 15-point action plan to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSMEs, the action plan notes, are “the driving force behind” many essential services in the pandemic. However, they are also particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of the crisis, especially in developing and transition economies. Beyond facing weaker consumer confidence and being overrepresented in the hardest-hit sectors such as retail trade, tourism, and personal and professional services, MSMEs have fewer assets, reduced access to credit, and a more challenging trade environment relative to large companies.

The plan for MSMEs is centered around five recommendations for businesses, five for business support organizations, and five for governments. An ITC news release featuring a consolidated set of recommendations reminds the reader in each of the three sections to both “prepare your immediate response to the crisis” and to “get ready for the ‘new normal’.”

Free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food.

The plan’s introduction highlights that the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates a decline in cross-border investment flows by up to 30-40% in 2020-2021. Accordingly, trade aspects feature prominently throughout the action plan, and are especially strong in the section for governments, though the plan emphasizes that governments, business support organizations, and small business alike should coordinate the immediate response in a collaborative manner. The plan calls on governments to implement support measures built around concessional financing, tax reductions and grants, employment incentives, and targeted interventions.

Resisting the allure of trade protectionism is paramount, the plan argues. It emphasizes that free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food. Thus, the plan also recommends that governments facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services, and streamline the movement of essential products by following best practices as outlined in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Actions include, inter alia: certificates for medical equipment and essential food items; enhanced border management coordination, for example between customs and sanitary authorities; special regimes for expedited clearance of certain goods; and accelerating clearance processes for trusted traders or authorized economic operators who respect health-related rules and regulations.

The plan also notes that governments can expand and facilitate access to trade finance for MSMEs, including those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The pandemic, the plan notes, has negatively impacted the availability of trade finance for small business due to higher liquidity costs and the perceived risk of short-term finance, leaving a void for governments to fill. The document notes that several economies have expanded short-term programmes that provide financial support to national exporters. Flagging that nearly all MSMEs rely on goods that have been sourced internationally, the plan stresses that now more than ever is the time “to conserve the links between small businesses and international markets.”

The plan underscores that trade documents and procedures can be digitalized in collaboration with the private sector, noting that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement encourages countries to introduce digital clearance processes. As noted above, such processes can simplify cross-border trade whilst limiting physical contact and in-person interactions. While the plan points to the private sector as having responsibility for digitalizing trade documents, it acknowledges that the onus is on governments to provide legal certainty that these documents will be recognized within their respective jurisdictions.

Continuing a longstanding tradition of advancing the United Nation's (UN) Global Goals, student leaders, scholars, and civil society representatives evaluated 15 diverse proposals seeking to mitigate global disparities.

Challenge finalists came together virtually from across six time zones, several states and countries to present their innovative ideas to enhance sustainable development. Nine high school students, and five undergraduates presented their solutions for crafting a more just society. The proposals addressed several of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and were inspired by the finalists' personal experiences in addressing gender equality, climate action, responsible consumption, and eliminating global poverty and hunger.

In his opening remarks, Dean Courtney Smith stressed the importance of youth embracing the SDGs. He emphasized that ""the future of sustainable development will largely be shaped by the innovative ideas of young scholars,"" highlighting that ""All of our Challenge finalists showcased these qualities through pioneering leadership, a drive to venture into unchartered territory and apply their ingenuity.""

Winning first place in the graduate division, Holt Henderson, an undergraduate student from Oregon, created a proposal for reducing hunger while improving economic growth after working on occupational development initiatives in Thailand. The experience inspired him to reshape the structures of agricultural development with the input of local stakeholders in poverty-stricken countries. Henderson argued that by creating a simple framework that highlights the most cost- effective agricultural products and with the help of NGOs, locals could bypass and reduce the cost of intermediaries.

Cynthia Chockalingam, a high school student hailing from Munster, Indiana, won first place in the undergraduate division. Chockalingam proposed an initiative that would expand community gardens to limit the effects of food deserts in the United States. Her action plan focused on student involvement by updating STEM curriculums to include programming pH and moisture readers to help create sustainable gardens. Focusing on local communities first, this initiative would later be able to be scaled up to regional and international levels to reduce both poverty and hunger.

Second place winners, William Watt and Shriya Iyer, focused on solutions that would restructure critical sectors to achieve sustainable production and consumption globally. In her proposal, Iyer argued that ""ending global hunger is a mission with a moving goalpost."" Her solution to the growing dilemma was centered on reforming agricultural policy, advancing biotechnology research on high yield crops, and developing sustainable sources of protein.

Watt, an undergraduate student hailing from Nashville, Tennessee, focused on revamping the textile industry to combat fast fashion by increasing awareness of its destructive consequences with the help of civil society leaders. He argued that by updating trade deals and provisions for emissions and chemical pollutants in countries that produce textiles, irresponsible production could be limited by imposing fines for companies that lack transparency.

These students join a cohort of previous finalists and winners who, through the Challenge, have been able to sharpen their project development skills and bring awareness to new and innovative solutions to address global issues. Recent finalists Cristian Ramos and Bradley Ryktarsyk are both current graduate students pursuing their M.A. in Diplomacy and International Relations. They have complemented their Challenge proposal research with skills gained through Diplomacy classes and internships.

Ramos, a second-year graduate student from Ciales, Puerto Rico, proposed a ""Refugee Legal Defense Project,"" which focused on speeding up the asylum process to hurry the exit of 25 million refugees worldwide currently living in refugee camps. Hs proposal included the creation of Legal Aid Centers to provide refugees with the legal tools required to start, continue, and finish their applications for asylum.

""I have continued to raise awareness of refugee issues and potential pathways forward through different presentations on campus, my Master’s research project, and my work at the United Nations Population Fund. These collective experiences and the knowledge, data and skills that I developed in the process have inspired me to launch a second project, , to support male refugees who are victims of sexual violence.""

Ryktarsyk, a Michigan native who just completed his first year of graduate studies, focused on integrating SDGs into STEM classrooms. Since the Challenge, he has been using the data collection skills that he’s picked up from his classes to identify more data points to support his project. He advises future applicants to ""start with a small concrete idea that can be expanded. Starting small will give you the chance to have an immediate impact and if you really understand the project you are working on, it will be much easier to scale-up when you have the resources.""

The dialogues gather UN Member States, civil society, and UN representatives for off-the-record discussions, in parallel to the ongoing intergovernmental consultations on the declaration.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the declaration – Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden – issued an “elements paper” on 9 April. The paper proposes the declaration contain three sections: Acknowledging achievements and looking ahead; Delivering on commitments and responding to global challenges; and Building consensus and mobilizing for change.

In 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature.

The first dialogue in the series took place on 23 April with a focus on ‘Acknowledging Achievements and looking ahead,’ the first section of the elements paper. According to the discussion summary, this dialogue gathered 157 representatives from 19 UN Member States and over 100 civil society organizations. The discussion highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic represents the clearest example of several, intersecting global crises. It points to the need to strengthen multilateralism and address mistrust.

Participants noted that in 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature. It was emphasized that inclusion is “not solely for representation,” since one group’s advancement should lead to the advancement of all. Similarly, national sovereignty itself should be re-evaluated. No country is autonomous in this interdependent world, participants emphasized, and addressing problems globally is in the best interest of all.

Building on this idea, the declaration should propose that the UN no longer function to find equilibrium among competing national interests, but strive to replace an intergovernmental approach with a supranational one. Other proposals included:

Establish a post-2020 process to consider and implement recommendations for reform.

Re-evaluate process for reaching consensus, to ensure a “recalcitrant few” cannot hold back a vast majority.

Consider possible formats for a UN Parliamentary Assembly.

The second dialogue, on 30 April, took up the declaration’s possible section on ‘Delivering on Commitments and Responding to Global Challenges,’ which is expected to contain the most substantive, practical proposals, and serve as the primary vehicle to lay out a plan for the future of the UN. The third dialogue in the series will convene on 7 May, to address ‘Building consensus and mobilizing for change.’ This section is meant to serve as the call to service for the governments of the world.

The co-facilitators of the intergovernmental consultations plan to share a zero draft of the declaration in early May 2020. The consultations are taking place via written comments.

Southeast Asia is the world’s “most polluting region” for ocean plastics, as noted by ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. The region’s fast-growing cities, in particular, contribute approximately 60% of plastic waste leakage into the environment. The pollution originates from uncollected waste and leakages in municipal waste management systems.

Local governments will use digital tools to identify waste generation “hot spots.”

Launched on 5 May 2020, the ‘Closing the Loop’ project, which is supported by the Government of Japan, will help to build the capacity of ASEAN cities to plan for and manage their plastic waste using circular economy principles. The pilot cities are: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand and Da Nang, Viet Nam.

First, a digital tool will help local governments monitor plastic waste leakage and identify “hot spots” for waste generation. The tool will use remote sensing, satellite and crowdsourced data applications to produce plastic waste maps and simulations.

Second, the project will provide training and tools for policymakers to develop policy and investment strategies that apply a “circular economy” approach in managing their plastic waste streams.

The project will support local implementation of two intergovernmental frameworks: the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris; and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, which was introduced during Japan’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) in 2019. The Osaka Vision is a commitment by G20 leaders to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050.

This multifaceted crisis will keep adding pressure to fragile communities. It calls for a comprehensive and collaborative response. And at the root of it is clean energy; essential to help countries prepare, respond, and recover from COVID-19 crisis.

Clean energy can provide affordable solutions that are in line with climate targets and can help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on people’s livelihoods and local economies.

On the frontline of the battle against COVID-19, energy for households and health centers is critical. Yet 840 million people don’t have electricity, 570 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa, where one in four clinics has no energy at all, and 28 percent don’t have consistent access.

Reliable power supply ensures that core systems for the management of health programmes can function effectively.

In regions where the electricity grid is unreliable or even non-existent, clean energy technologies provide solutions that can be deployed rapidly. With reliable energy, health centers can work around the clock, instead of relying on candles or phone flashlights.

Solar for Health

The Solar for Health programme, funded principally by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, UNDP and Innovation Norway, and ongoing in 11 countries since 2016, showcases a green model that improves health services while saving lives, the environment, and money.

UNDP and its partners seek to build on this expertise to support countries in scaling up clean energy investments for the electrification of health centers.

Clean energy can also address some of the health risks that might make people more vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Nearly half of the world relies on polluting fuels and inefficient stoves for cooking, at considerable health and environmental costs. Every year 3.8 million people die prematurely from illnesses linked to smoke from open fire or stoves. Promoting the use of clean fuels and energy efficient stoves can protect billions of people from breathing in harmful fumes at home every day.

Access to energy also makes social distancing policies viable by powering the technologies and devices that help people to stay in touch with each other, receive information, engage in online education, and work from home. It can also provide reliable access to clean water, a crucial element in times of COVID-19. It also ensures food security by enabling food cold chains, and powering water pumps.

Boost investment in clean energy

Clean energy can also fuel economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. Renewable energies are an engine for job creation. A record 11 million people worldwide were employed in the renewables sector in 2018 and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that this number could rise to 42 million jobs globally by 2050.

Clean energy also boosts local economies. Decentralized, off-grid energy systems can help small businesses thrive and offer potential for sources for additional income.

Clean energy is available, affordable, and reliable. But in many developing countries and economies, the potential for large scale renewable energy projects remains largely untapped. Investments in this area are still much lower than would be required to deliver clean energy’s full development and climate benefits.

Lifting barriers

Across the world, UNDP is working with governments to lift the barriers that impede these investments. By addressing the policy and financial risks associated to such investments in developing economies, UNDP aims to help government create an enabling environment for renewable energy. UNDP’s Africa Minigrid Programme and Solar for Health, being set up in over 11 countries, is set to expand across the continent.

As nations prepare for the COVID-19 aftermath, there is a tremendous opportunity for a global reset. Ambitious green stimulus plans will help countries restore their economies while deepening their energy transition. As oil prices drop to historical lows, we need to ensure the world stays on track with its climate targets. Now is a good time to reform fossil fuel subsidies and re-assess the options countries have to accelerate their clean energy transition to sustain a recovery that’s better for all.

The report has been prepared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

SDG 7

Sustainability

According to the report, significant progress had been made on various aspects of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 prior to the start of the COVID-19 crisis. This includes a notable reduction in the number of people worldwide lacking access to electricity, strong uptake of renewable energy for electricity generation, and improvements in energy efficiency.

Despite these advances, global efforts remain insufficient to reach the key targets of SDG 7 by 2030.

“Even before today’s unprecedented crisis, the world was not on track to meet key sustainable energy goals. Now, they are likely to become even harder to achieve. This means we must redouble our efforts to bring affordable, reliable and cleaner energy to all – especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need is greatest – in order to build more prosperous and resilient economies,” noted Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of IEA.

The number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 789 million in 2018, however, under policies that were either in place or planned before the start of the COVID-19 crisis, an estimated 620 million people would still lack access in 2030, 85% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. SDG 7 calls for universal energy access by 2030.

Other important elements of the SDG 7 goal also continue to be off track. Almost 3 billion people remained without access to clean cooking in 2017, mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Largely stagnant progress since 2010 leads to millions of deaths each year from breathing cooking smoke. The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is only inching up gradually, despite the rapid growth of wind and solar power in electricity generation.

An acceleration of renewables across all sectors is required to move closer to reaching the SDG 7 target, with advances in heating and transport currently lagging far behind their potential.

Following strong progress on global energy efficiency between 2015 and 2016, the pace has slackened.

The report says the rate of improvement needs to speed up dramatically, from 1.7% in 2017 to at least 3% in coming years.

Accelerating the pace of progress in all regions and sectors will require stronger political commitment, long-term energy planning, increased public and private financing, and adequate policy and fiscal incentives to spur faster deployment of new technologies an increased emphasis on “leaving no one behind” is required, given the large proportion of the population without access in remote, rural, poorer and vulnerable communities.

Riccardo Puliti, Global Director for Energy and Extractive Industries and Regional Director for Infrastructure in Africa at the World Bank, commented: “The report provides solid data and evidence that build the case for why it is necessary to act now, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where under the status quo, 530 million people–or more than two times the population of Nigeria–will still be without electricity in 2030.”

Moving towards the 2030 Agenda

The 2020 report introduces tracking on a new indicator, 7.A.1, on international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy.

Although total flows have doubled since 2010, reaching $21.4 billion in 2017, only 12% reached the least-developed countries, which are the furthest from achieving the various SDG 7 targets.

The five custodian agencies of the report were designated by the UN Statistical Commission to compile and verify country data, along with regional and global aggregates, in relation to the progress in achieving the SDG 7 goals.

“This report is an exemplar case of cooperation between the custodian agencies of SDG 7 to present comprehensive data and analysis, delivering a common message regarding the progress towards ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

As to the current situation, it concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic can either widen the sustainable energy access gaps or accelerate the path towards achieving SDG 7, depending mostly on priorities of national economic stimulus packages and the global response to support those most in need,” said Stefan Schweinfest, UNSD Director.

The report presents policymakers and development partners with global, regional and country-level data to inform decisions and identify priorities for a sustainable recovery from COVID-19 that scales up affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy.

This collaborative work highlights once more the importance of reliable data to inform policymaking as well as the opportunity to enhance data quality through international cooperation to further strengthen national capacities.

The report has been transmitted by SDG 7 custodian agencies to the United Nations Secretary-General to inform the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s annual review.

It argues that the “true test” of 2030 Agenda financing is not how much is invested in projects on one or more of the 169 SDG targets, but whether projects are designed to minimize the negative externalities and maximize the positive externalities across multiple Goals and targets.

Authors Maria Alejandra Riaño and Damien Barchiche explain that synergies among SDGs and their targets “do not occur automatically.” As shown by the ongoing pandemic, one missing element such as efficient governance, health system, energy provision, or management of natural resources—can have effects throughout the economy and society.

This is related to the growing risk of “SDG-washing,” the authors suggest. Understanding the actual impact of investment flows is particularly important during a crisis. They report that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on several initiatives to help map financing flows to the SDGs and assess remaining needs and gaps.

With regard to country-level financing, the brief recommends developing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, as agreed by UN Member States in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development. The Frameworks would spell out financing and implementation plans for the national sustainable development strategy, thus providing investors with clarity and predictability “across the three time horizons of relief, recovery and long-term structural transformation.”

The issue brief titled, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: prerequisites, and opportunities for the post-Covid-19 crisis,’ says effectively implementing and financing the 2030 Agenda requires “forceful” alliances and partnerships that are grounded in local and national needs and capabilities, invest heavily upfront, invest in innovation and use science-based solutions, and have the support and participation of government authorities.

The Campaign for a Decade of Accountability is a multi-stakeholder partnership to aims to “bolster concerted action and amplify efforts to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development in a coordinated manner.” Advisory Group members to the Campaign include the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), the UN Global Compact, and World Vision. The Campaign is complementary to the UN’s Decade of Action and Delivery for the SDGs.

Survey respondents are asked to: rank specific challenges to accountability for the SDGs in their country, and indicate support needed to address them; comment on expected impacts of COVID-19 on SDG accountability in their country; share information on their country’s platforms enabling stakeholders to engage with the SDG accountability; and how global processes can help to advance SDG accountability. The survey also requests examples and case studies on specific actions that have been undertaken to enhance SDG accountability.

Inputs collected through the survey will feed into the forthcoming ‘Global SDG Accountability Report’ with recommendations for advancing accountability for the 2030 Agenda. The survey is available in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish.

Also on advancing accountability, the Transparency, Accountability and Participation (TAP) Network and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) launched a publication analyzing how nine countries’ voluntary national reviews (VNRs) have addressed SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), in comparison with how civil society reports have done so, over a two-year period. The publication provides recommendations for stakeholders to enable stronger and more inclusive reporting for SDG 16 in subsequent reporting cycles, including:

Integrate findings from civil society reports into VNR reports;

Scale up reporting, monitoring, and review of SDG 16-related actions, such as: measures to mainstream SDG 16 into development plans, collection and use of data, including non-official sources, and targeted policies with a focus on leaving no one behind;

Establish platforms for civil society representatives to regularly engage with government on issues relevant for sustainable development;

Use existing platforms (HLPF, regional economic commissions’ fora for sustainable development, expert group meetings on specific SDGs) to encourage dedicated awareness raising, peer exchange and global learning; and

Increase comparability of civil society reports, possibly through templates and other guidance.

Gahouma-Bekale highlights 2020 as “an important year for the completion of the rules of the Paris Agreement and the Communication of revised and updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as well as the start of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.” He laments the postponement due to COVID-19 of many events which are crucial to building political momentum before the sessions of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies and COP 26.

The AGN emphasizes the urgency for all nations to take ambitious collective climate action at COP 26. Highlighting African countries’ particular vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the Group notes scientists have warned that the world has reached a “tipping point.”

The AGN calls on developed countries to close the climate finance gap by the end of 2020 despite the postponement of the COP, in line with the commitment by developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. However, the statement notes, a September 2019 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that developed countries provided only USD 71.2 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2017.

An Assessment of VLRs to Date,"There are only ten years left to deliver the 2030 Agenda. However, as speakers and reports prepared for the 2019 SDGs Summit clearly demonstrated, we are not progressing fast enough. To increase momentum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres inaugurated the ‘Decade of Action’ in January 2020. The Decade is built on three levels of action—global action, local action, and people action—to accelerate progress on the SDGs.

Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) could be an important vehicle to accelerate ‘local action’. Four VLRs were launched during the July 2018 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – by Kitakyushu, Shimokawa, and Toyama in Japan, and New York City in the US. These VLRs have ignited enthusiasm among other cities.

Building on these efforts to localize the SDGs and to further our contribution to the “Decade of Action,” the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) has released two complementary publications to highlight and support the work of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) in implementing the 2030 Agenda:

The “State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs” is a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020.

“The Shimokawa Method for Voluntary Local Review: A Blueprint for Localising the SDGs” is a method on how to conduct a VLR based on Shimokawa’s experience.

We understand the VLR as a process in which LRGs voluntarily review and follow-up implementation of the SDGs. This process becomes a vehicle for sharing experiences, challenges and lessons learnt, as well as to open avenues for new partnerships to address any current shortcomings LRGs might confront. It can also enable LRGs to engage communities in the process, thereby strengthening the accountability and inclusiveness of their policymaking.

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report analyzes the 16 VLRs that had been identified as of February 2020. Of these “first generation” VLRs, four were launched in 2018, ten in 2019, and two in 2020 (all are available at the VLR Lab, here). After summarizing the main characteristics of the 16 VLRs, this report focuses on two crucial aspects of conducting a local review: the level to which the VLR process engages with stakeholders, and the alignment of the VLR with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process. The report reviews the impressive number of commitments and actions that are already underway at the local level, details which are often missing in VNRs.

The comparative analysis of VLRs revealed that conducting a VLR can unlock meaningful opportunities for cities and regions. In particular, a VLR: 1) allows the local government to listen to the needs of its people and reflect them into local policymaking; 2) invites self-reflection; 3) provides for a process that is data-driven and can be used to plan for action to achieve the future we want; and 4) gives a local take on the global conversation on sustainable development. Altogether, these opportunities can lead to transformation. The report also found that the majority of the first generation of VLRs have focused chiefly on aligning the SDGs with local policies, but have not explicitly included a stakeholder engagement process, with notable exceptions being Shimokawa, Manheim, and New Taipei.

In the conclusion of the report, we emphasized the need to envision the next generation of VLRs. The next generation should maximize the meaningful opportunities provided by the VLR process, as identified in the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report, to capture all its benefits. We suggest that these opportunities will only be fully crystalized once the current approach is changed.

A key recommendation for maximizing these benefits is to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the VLR process, and to enable this engagement to be thorough and self-organised. In the case of Shimokawa, a community-led platform with staff from all bureaus of the town hall developed the new 2030 vision, fully embracing the SDGs. This vision then guided Shimokawa’s comprehensive plan (the highest level of planning), and contributed to fostering ownership of the town vision and plan. In addition, Shimokawa specifically tried to engage communities during the action-plan setting phase and helped establish an implementation platform that could mobilize different stakeholders for different community-led initiatives.

This planning process was built on “backcasting,” an approach that identifies a desirable outcome and then walks backwards to find measures to reach the final destination. The case of Shimokawa demonstrates that this approach enables a more robust, transformative policy process than through the use of forecasting, while also allowing for continuously revisiting the vision initially set if the circumstances change.

The report on the Shimokawa Method for VLRs builds on the mechanism used in the Shimokawa case, translating it into ten practical and straightforward steps, This report also incorporates findings from the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report and contains a guide for “VLR format” to which cities can refer as they construct their own VLRs.

The Next Generation of VLRs

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report presents an assessment of the currently available VLRs, while the Shimokawa Method report provides a handbook for implementing VLRs. These two documents seek to pave the way for improving the VLR process. While many internal areas of improvements related to VLRs can be addressed by using the Shimokawa method, more must be done. In particular, when looking to increase the global and national impact of VLRs, cities must strive to integrate their VLRs with their national VNR processes, so that a country can address territorial challenges and scale up successful local solutions.

The principles that underlie the 2030 Agenda resonate strongly with the ongoing global crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic is reminding humanity that society as a whole is as vulnerable as its most vulnerable people. It also brings into sharp focus the ramifications of inequality at many levels. These challenges cannot be suddenly alleviated during the crisis. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.” Recovery must go beyond “returning” and aim to “Build Back Better”, anchored in leaving no one and no place behind. VLRs can be instrumental to this end, building resilience and transforming our cities.

The event provided the opportunity for AOSIS members and others to highlight synergies between the disruption of COVID-19 and climate change, and the ways in which responses to the pandemic support more sustainable climate action and ambition in the lead up to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC and beyond.

The Placencia Ambition Forum convened virtually from 20-22 April 2020, and was hosted by the Government of Belize, which is currently serving as AOSIS Chair.

The Forum made the case for accelerating inclusive, green transitions, with COVID-19 magnifying the importance of the priorities of small island developing States (SIDS) for the global climate change agenda. For example, reduced use of transport and energy demand due to the pandemic show that change is possible.

Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that retreating on climate action in the face of the pandemic is not an option given that the social and economic devastation caused by climate disruption will be exponentially greater than the COVID-19 crisis. He emphasized the need to “build back better” from the pandemic and use the recovery from COVID-19 impacts to ensure a more sustainable and resilient future. He said he will continue to advocate for debt relief, including for middle-income countries (MICs), to enable SIDS to survive both the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change.

Others also reiterated their support for SIDS. For example, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) committed to work on innovative financial structuring to ensure that stimulus packages do not compound the debt burden faced by SIDS, and to improve access to finance, especially in response to the pandemic.



The Forum reiterated that the intersecting climate and COVID-19 crises require actions that simultaneously address both challenges, with stimulus packages and other COVID-19 responses that are aligned with climate targets and that enable transition to greener, cleaner, and more resilient societies. For example, expanding renewable energy capacity in SIDS and least developed countries (LDCs) is consistent with efforts to enhance the sustainable water and energy supply required for medical purposes.

The Forum resulted in a Declaration titled, ‘2020 – Our Year of Ambition,’ which calls for:

ambitious, detailed, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that will close the gap between where we are now and where we need to be to limit global warming to 1.5°C;

new financial commitments that deliver on support and reflect ambition, including deeper discussions at COP 26 on the long-term finance goal to provide certainty for more ambitious mid- to long-term climate actions; and

enhanced near-term action to protect the vulnerable, including short-term action and domestic reform within the context of building long-term resilience.

The Declaration also urges countries to follow through with COVID-19 recovery plans that incorporate policies and measures that help jump start NDC implementation and lead to enhanced ambition and action. It calls for a ‘Roadmap for Political Momentum’ towards COP 26, and welcomes the Group of 20 (G20) commitment to use the SDGs and other international commitments to guide recovery from COVID-19.

The Declaration explains that the health and climate crises both reveal vulnerabilities to systemic shocks and demand unprecedented transitions to “flatten their respective curves and drive an exponential shift in their trajectories.” The Declaration calls for 2020 to be “the year of ambition,” beginning with plans to change emission trajectories towards achieving 1.5°C.

The Forum fed into the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which recognized efforts of the Placencia Ambition Forum to maintain the momentum in addressing climate change despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

SDG officially releases their new Bel-Air V3 saddle

Intense and GT were early adopters of the Bel-Air, along with the Honda G-Cross Team, pictured here using the first Bel-Air I-Beam version.

Back in 2005 the Pinkbike DH Team ran animal print Bel-Air saddles

What Has Changed Then?

- Shorter and Slimmed Down Profile:

I’ve ridden SDG saddles and almost every Bel-Air model since the early 2000s. The new V3 is slimmed down and hugely versatile. I now run it across the board, including my slalom bike, trail bike, long travel and ebike. — Kyle Strait

- Enhanced Comfort Features:

The new ""Fuel"" colorway.

- Modernized Construction and Aesthetics:

Brage Vestavik and Kirt Voreis

I’m proud of the new Bel-Air V3. Understanding our roots, it was important for us to keep the heritage of the Bel-Air alive. My team and I worked tirelessly to further enhance and I strongly believe that the new Bel-Air V3 will continue to keep riders satisfied in the saddle for another decade. — Tyler Anspach (SDG Owner)

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles. The SDG Bel-Air V3 extends premium craftsmanship across the full lineup and hits several price points thanks to several rail material options.

From large broadcasters and established print media, to news agencies, radio stations and newer digital publishers, the SDG Media Compact spans 160 countries on five continents, reaching a combined audience of about 2 billion people through well over one hundred outlets owned by Compact members.



“Media play a crucial role in countering misinformation and galvanizing action for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis based on science, solidarity and our common roadmap, the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications. “We are proud to have one hundred SDG Media Compact members from across the globe, committed to covering the critical issues of our time and driving progress toward a healthier and more peaceful world.”



The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by world leaders in 2015, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030. UN expert voices, data, reports and stories are regularly shared with SDG Media Compact members, inspiring coverage of the Goals without interfering in editorial freedom. As part of the UN’s new Verified initiative, Compact members will also be receiving trusted and accurate content about COVID-19 to counter misinformation and flood the internet and airwaves with content on science, solutions and solidarity.



For Sky Group, Europe’s leading media and entertainment company, being part of the SDG Media Compact means acting on the big global issues that matter. “We’ve aligned our strategy with the Sustainable Development Goals because they provide clear purpose to ensure business drives the change that is crucial to improving our world,” said Jeremy Darroch, Sky Group’s CEO.



Shanghai Media Group, one of the newest members, joined the Compact to be part of a global alliance working toward common goals. “It is our sincere wish to work closely with global media organizations to jointly build a community of shared future for mankind,” said Chairwoman Jianjun Wang.



For ATTN:, a digital publisher based in the United States, “partnering with the United Nations and having the ability to tap into their expert voices and data helps us ensure that our storytelling is well-sourced and informational, giving human interest stories the power to have real impact,” said Charlie Goldensohn, Senior Strategist at ATTN:.



“In a digital world full of misinformation and fake news, credibility is vital, and that is what we have greatly gained through our partnership with the SDG Media Compact and the rich editorial content shared,” said Maikem Emmanuela Manzie on behalf of Ndefcam radio in Cameroon. “The free flow of information on current issues, especially on COVID-19, has helped in building our stories on how the community can better fight this new virus.”



Many members have already played a crucial role in countering misinformation, disseminating science-based information to fight the virus, and covering the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 in the context of the broader sustainable development agenda.



SBS Australia examined how and why conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus are spreading so quickly. Sky News debunked the conspiracy theory linking 5G radio antennas to the coronavirus. Noticias Positivas reported on the issue of fake news related to the pandemic. ATTN: launched a digital literacy series focused on helping young people distinguish fact from fiction on COVID-related content. And the Asahi Shimbun explained why antagonizing the World Health Organization won’t bring the world closer to containing the virus.



On the socio-economic front, Euronews, in an interview with the UN Secretary-General, called attention to the need for global solidarity for the world to emerge stronger from the crisis. CGTN published a number of pieces calling for debt relief for the poorest nations. The Nikkei reported on the need for mental health services as an essential part of the COVID-19 response. And Prensa Latina disseminated the Secretary-General’s call to protect the well-being of children.



On environmental matters, the Jakarta Post was among the outlets that amplified the UN Secretary-General’s call for a green recovery from the pandemic, SBS looked at how COVID-19 could be a chance to green our economies, In Depth News explained how ecosystems and human health intersect, and Scientific American reported on the crisis’ impact on CO2 emissions and implications for a green recovery.



Looking at the gender dimensions, the Mainichi amplified the UN Secretary-General’s call to address the pandemic’s consequences for women and girls. Devex, in an interview with UN Women, highlighted the outsized impacts of the crisis on women’s work, health, and livelihoods. And Sky aired the UN Secretary-General’s message urging governments to prioritize the prevention and redress of violence against women in their COVID response plans.

They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform

Maybe it’s time we agreed on another SDG – The 18th Goal: Managingor Handling Pandemics.

The SDGs or Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in September 2015 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform. Of course, they followed the somewhat unsuccessful MDGs or Millennium Development Goals that the member states had adopted earlier. These were eight goals expected to be realised by the year 2015 that were adopted at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.

It was,however, found by 2013 that progress towards the MDG goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. Experts and critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. The UN therefore, felt it appropriate to redesign the world’s goals for development and member states thus officially adopted the historic new agenda for development, entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” and now includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets.These 17 SDGs are comprehensive, and all-encompassing and embrace all aspects of development for the world including poverty, inequality and hunger; health and education; water and sanitation; energy and industry; decent work; infrastructure and urbanisation; climate change, peace and justice. They balance the economic, social and ecological dimensions of sustainable development, and place the fight against poverty and development on the same agenda for the first time. Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. In India, the NITIAayog is coordinating the SDGs progress and implementation. It has constructed the SDG India Index spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs and tracks progress across all States and UTs. It also measures their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India.

We are now in 2020. Five years since 2015 and the adoption of these SDGs and we find that at the international level, progress in some areas, such as on extreme poverty reduction, widespread immunization, decrease in child mortality rates and increase in people’s access to electricity, but slow going on many other programmes. Probably the global response has not been ambitious enough, leaving the most vulnerable people and countries to suffer the most.

And as we face the COVID 19 pandemic, there is danger that many societies may slip on the progress made so far. The most important thing that COVID 19 has taught us is global cooperation. Even the very competitive multi-national pharma companies are sharing their individual confidences and collaborating with other pharma companies and labs in trying to find a Vaccine. Today we need effective collaboration and shared communication among health experts, economists, scientists and policy makers. That is the only way we will manage to manageto contain this Corona Virus.

As Yuval Noah Harari, the famous Israeli historian and philosophersaid in a recent interview, we now need a collective leadership – ‘like a coalition of the willing’! He argues that even for promoting nationalism it’s better to protect your own when everybody is protected. Emergencies accelerate the momentum of history. We thus need global solidarity to take the right decisions now and that is why we need a new SDG 18!

Many people predict the future but hardly anyone listens. Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 2015 famously talked about preparing for pandemicsand today we have social media claiming that he did it to promote his work in vaccines! Cynics will always abound, but global governance must use the structures it has to take collective decisions. Because if you solve it in some countries but the poor countries remain affected, you may get unmanageable immigration and even conflict.

Some of the lessons from COVID will change our social behaviour for example online meetings and virtual education, but basic human nature and structures of governance will still be there. The earlier epidemics didn’t change these either whether they be SARS, Spanish Flu or AIDS. So, if the same structures of global governance remain then we must use these structures to address this pandemic and its aftermath.

It could be argued that the SDGs already have Goal 3: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’. However, it could also be argued that this is too narrow an agenda. This Pandemic is proving to be much more than just a health issue. Despite the life vs livelihood debate the fact remains that the global economy is in a downward tailspin. This debacle will impact not just health but the very basis of what we consider to be human. The response to it must therefore be multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral. Thus the need for a new development agenda – SDG 18: Managing Pandemics.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

In 2019, 76 third-parties submitted 119 proposals from 40 developing countries. Eighty-five percent of the nominated ventures had raised at least half a million dollars at the time of nomination, and closed their Series A. All 12 finalists were mid-sized, with an average of up to 50 employees, annual revenue of over US$3 million, and with a cumulative impact on more than 15 million lives through their products and services.

This second edition is made possible through partnership with EPFL Tech4Impact, Orange, and Software Company, SAP.","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) this week invited 12 entrepreneurs from developing countries to pitch at the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Finance Geneva Summit (SGSGeneva).
According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.)

157,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/observations-on-the-quest-to-build-back-better/,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Observations on the Quest to Build Back Better,"The SDG Knowledge Hub spoke with Mandeep Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer at CIVICUS, about his assessment of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on the 2030 Agenda. Tiwana highlights the persistence of “MDG mindsets” and an increase in censorship and surveillance. He also suggests five ways to build a better post-pandemic world.

What have you observed about the SDG community’s responses to the pandemic?

Significant attention is being focused on the negative impacts of COVID-19, especially on impoverished and excluded communities. Important issues such as debt relief and financing for development have come to the fore. For example, the IMF announced immediate debt service relief for 25 countries in April, and further efforts are underway.

Yet, across the board, “MDG mindsets” remain stubbornly prevalent. The MDGs were weak in their comprehension of development by focusing on a small sub-set of rights. They were also charity-oriented in their approach, and reinforced top-down aid in the Global South.

The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential. However, five years since the passage of the SDGs, the impulse in many quarters is still to scale up existing approaches. A lot of the emphasis remains on “soft” communications and feel-good actions, rather than to push for fundamental changes in how our societies and economies function to better realize rights.

What impacts do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda?

COVID-19 could be a turning point. I have guarded optimism that we could overcome the paucity of ambition that has held us back from making transformative shifts.

COVID-19 has exposed and accelerated existing problems in our societies. Inequality, exclusion, and lack of voice were already marring progress on the 2030 Agenda. With COVID-19, the worst impacts are being felt by the disadvantaged as hunger and deprivation abound. Violence against women and excluded minorities has spiked. All of this is undermining the commitment to leave no one behind. Recent protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world highlight the importance of people’s participation for overcoming structural inequities and getting States to discharge their responsibilities to ensure proper health care, education, and access to justice for those most at risk. Thus, a silver lining has been renewed purpose among activists and civil society organizations to demand radical shifts to ‘leave no one behind.’

However, a less constructive trend has emerged as well. As public safety has taken center stage, censorship and surveillance have ramped up along with official propaganda. Many governments have sought to control the narrative about their pandemic response by clamping down on civic freedoms. Even before COVID-19 struck, only three percent of the world’s population lived in countries where the fundamental civic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association were adequately protected, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, our participatory research platform that measures civic space around the world.

There are worrying signs that COVID-19 emergency restrictions could be used as a smokescreen for a broader crackdown on dissent. The negative legacy of COVID-19 could last as long as the wave of dubious security measures passed in the wake of 9/11. This would undermine accountability for the 2030 Agenda.

Have any new lessons emerged that can inform plans and strategies to “build back better”?

Our vulnerabilities stand exposed by COVID-19. However, as we begin this Decade of Accountability for the SDGs (a multi-stakeholder campaign to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development), we still have an opportunity to build better forward by creating greener and fairer societies. In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.

First, civic freedoms and democratic rights are essential as our leaders are making life-or-death choices that could define the fate of generations. Concerned citizens, the media, and civil society organizations must have access to credible information and be able to exercise fundamental civic freedoms, in order to shape decisions in people’s best interests and hold decision makers to account. In a positive example in Paraguay, the government has set up a website that allows the public to track COVID-19 expenditure and engage directly with public officials.

Second, now is the time to rethink how our economies are structured. This means avoiding harsh austerity policies or market fundamentalism that prioritizes the interests of big business in recovery. To make a dent in inequality we need radical shifts such as progressive taxation and reinforcing the state’s responsibility to directly provide quality essential services. State funding for military infrastructures and repressive state apparatuses should be repurposed towards social safety nets.

We also urge better protection of worker’s rights. Towards this end CIVICUS has put in place a social security protocol to ensure job security, and to protect the mental and physical well-being of our co-workers.

Third, the needs of the most excluded people should be placed front and center. Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first. Steps must be taken to safeguard the rights of women and the health and wellbeing of older people and children, and to prevent violence against them. Economic stimulus plans should target those who are most vulnerable. For example, Spain has taken steps to introduce a basic monthly income for about a million of the country’s most impoverished households. We encourage other countries to adopt a similar policy.

It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts. CIVICUS is urging funders to exercise flexibility and listen to their partners as they navigate disruptions in programme activities and planned convenings. We also call for a greater proportion of funds to be delivered to organizations directly serving people on the ground.

Fourth, international cooperation remains vital. Multilateral institutions need to be adequately resourced and supported by governments in the spirit of multilateralism. Responses to the pandemic must strengthen and uphold the autonomy of international institutions, not only the World Health Organization but also institutions that promote human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Like pandemics, major contemporary challenges such as conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation have spillover effects beyond their borders. Strong international institutions and cooperation are needed to realize initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire.

Fifth, now is an opportune time to ramp up action on climate change. The healing of nature seen in so many places should be nurtured. New ways of working introduced during the crisis that reduce carbon footprints should continue where possible. The Paris Agreement must receive new life to ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and rises in global temperature are kept to a minimum. Recovery plans are an opportunity to invest in employment that advances the transition to a green economy.

Human rights cut across many of your proposals, for example in the need for transparency, protecting workers and the most disadvantaged, and strengthening human rights institutions. Why are human rights so relevant during COVID-19?

Countries that appear to have done better are ones that have empathetic leaders who have been inclusive in their policy responses and have involved civil society in decision making. This is all part of a human rights approach. In April this year, over 650 civil society organizations from around the world co-signed a letter calling on world leaders to respect human dignity and rights in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We can’t turn the corner towards transformation after COVID-19 without a human rights approach.

The post-2020 approach to international chemicals management had been scheduled to be adopted during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020. The pandemic caused the postponement of the final preparatory meeting for ICCM5 a few weeks before it was scheduled to take place at the end of March 2020, along with the postponement of ICCM5 itself. Both events are now expected to take place in 2021.

During a webinar organized by the Geneva Environment Network to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sound management of chemicals and waste, Nalini Sharma, SAICM Secretariat, noted that the Strategic Approach’s work is connected to the pandemic, particularly through the issue of waste management. She highlighted challenges for SAICM Beyond 2020, including linkages to other agendas, such as biodiversity and climate change. She added that a discussion on linkages between the SAICM Beyond 2020 and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework processes includes identifying activities for better coordination between the two clusters.

Three options for the rescheduled preparatory meeting were identified by Valentina Sierra, Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN in Geneva. One option under consideration is early March 2021 in Bucharest, Romania, where it was originally scheduled to take place in March 2020. The other two options are early March 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with the fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 5), in Nairobi, Kenya, or early July 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with ICCM5 itself, in Bonn, Germany. ICCM5 has been rescheduled to take place from 5-9 July 2021, in Bonn, Germany.

Sierra reported that small virtual working groups, open online briefings, and submissions of written comments could also contribute to the finalization of outcomes for SAICM Beyond 2020, for adoption at ICCM5. She also called attention to the work of the High-Level Ambition Alliance for chemicals and waste, which seeks to raise awareness and ensure commitment for action on chemicals and waste management.

WHO has estimated that sound chemicals management could prevent at least 1.6 million deaths per year.

Representatives from Geneva-based UN agencies discussed the linkages between chemicals management and the issues that their organizations focus on. Manal Azzi, Senior Specialist on Occupational Safety and Health, International Labour Organization (ILO), stressed the importance of the ILO in the chemicals’ field, notably because of workers’ exposure to chemicals along the entire supply chain. Carolyn Vickers, Head, Chemical Safety and Health Unit, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized the WHO Chemicals Roadmap, and establishment of a global chemicals and health network, where national ministries network to facilitate the implementation of the roadmap. Vickers highlighted that at least 1.6 million deaths could be prevented annually by the sound management of chemicals and waste.

Discussing the role of civil society in the Beyond 2020 process, Giulia Carlini, Center for International Environmental Law, said the July 2021 ICCM5 and BRS COPs in Bonn, Germany, would disadvantage non-European participants. She said an online process, including virtual working group sessions and technical briefings, should ensure meaningful and effective participation going forward.

The webinar was part of the GENeva Environment Dialogues’ special bi-weekly COVID-19 series, which focuses on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global environmental agenda.","The post-2020 approach to international chemicals management had been scheduled to be adopted during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020.

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

By the latest version of the text, the UNGA would specify eight SDGs for in-depth review during the 2021 session of the HLPF, and hold more forward-looking discussions during the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021).

Kaha Imnadze (Georgia) and Jean-Claude do Rego (Benin), co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations for the review process of ECOSOC and HLPF, explain that they focused the revised draft only on 2021 partly in order to “bridge the gap between the positions of delegations.”

The co-facilitators released the zero draft of the resolution on 24 April, which proposed themes, SDGs, and “areas for acceleration” to be discussed at the next three HLPF session (2021, 2022, and 2023). By that draft, SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnership for the Goals) would be reviewed each year. Member States discussed the zero draft on 8 May, and several delegations subsequently submitted written inputs: Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, the Group of 77 and China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The revised version of the text, dated 8 June, now identifies SDGs for review only during the 2021 session of the HLPF. Preambular paragraphs in the revised draft note that the COVID-19 pandemic poses threats to sustainable development, including in the areas of health and the world economy, and that the poorest and most vulnerable people are the most affected. This hampers progress towards the SDGs. The introductory text continues, “implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial to help better equip the world for future systemic shocks,” and the SDGs provide a “blueprint” for recovery that leaves no one behind.

The revised draft proposes that the 2021 theme for ECOSOC and HLPF would be ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action.’ The 2021 HLPF would take up three “areas of acceleration”: health and human well-being; sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies; and healthy nutrition patterns.

In-depth reviews would be held on several SDGs – “namely, but not limited to” the eight SDGs most closely associated with these areas: Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and wellbeing), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals). The in-depth reviews will address interlinkages between the SDGs to promote actions that “create co-benefits, address synergies and trade-offs, and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.” They would also account for the impacts of COVID-19 on the SDGs.

By the revised draft resolution, the UNGA would decide to conduct the reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF during its 75th session, which begins in September 2020. The informal meetings for the review would be open to major groups and other relevant stakeholders.

Discussions during the 75th session also would define the themes for the HLPF and ECOSOC sessions in 2022 and 2023.

A virtual consultation will convene on 15 June for a paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the revised text.

161,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-covid-19-impacts-on-investment-flows/,"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNCTAD Report Details COVID-19 Impacts on Investment Flows,"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released the World Investment Report 2020, which states that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a “steep drop” in investment flows and has hit developing countries the hardest. The report finds that lockdown measures have slowed existing investment prospects and caused multinational enterprises to reassess new projects.

The World Investment Report 2020 titled, ‘International Production Beyond the Pandemic,’ projects that global foreign direct investment (FDI) will decrease up to 40 percent in 2020, bringing FDI below USD 1 trillion for the first time since 2005. FDI is expected to decrease 5-10 percent in 2021 and to begin to recover in 2022, led by global value chains, replenishment of capital stock, recovery of the global economy, and restructuring for resilience. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said the outlook is “highly uncertain” and depends on “the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.” He stressed that the transformation underway in international production will “impact developing countries over the coming decade” and requires a “major policy rethink.”

The 2020 report highlights three technology trends of the industrial revolution that are expected to shape international production: additive manufacturing; enhanced supply chain digitalization; and robotics-enabled automation. The policy environment for trade and investment and sustainability concerns, such as differences between regions and countries on emission targets and environmental, social, and governance standards, will influence the pace and extent of technological adoption. The report states that there is an opportunity for increased sustainability if countries and regions take advantage of the new industrial revolution and overcome growing economic nationalism. The report describes four possible trajectories: reshoring; diversification; regionalization; and replication.

The outlook depends on the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.

The report features a chapter on investment in the SDGs, which finds that international private sector flows to four out of ten key SDG areas have “failed to increase substantially since the adoption of the goals” in 2015. Progress on investment in the SDGs is visible in infrastructure, climate change mitigation, food and agriculture, health, telecommunication, and ecosystems and biodiversity. Although sustainability-themed funds are growing rapidly in number, size, and variety, these finances are not yet translating into investments on the ground in developing countries. The report also finds that very few national strategies on sustainable development address the promotion of investment in the SDGs, and further warns that existing investment promotion instruments related to the SDGs are “limited in number and follow a piecemeal approach,” with countries most often promoting investment in the SDGs through incentive schemes. To ensure that increased interest in SDG finance translates into increased SDG investment, the report presents an ‘Action Plan for Investment in the SDGs.’

The Action Plan presents six transformative actions: mainstreaming the SDGs in national investment policy frameworks and in the international investment treaty regime; reorienting investment promotion and facilitation strategies towards SDG investment; establishing regional SDG investment compacts; fostering new forms of partnerships for SDG investment; deepening environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices’ integration in financial markets by establishing a global monitoring mechanism with a harmonized approach to disclosure; and changing the global business mindset. The Plan is a response to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution on ‘Promoting Investments for Sustainable Development’ (A/RES/74/199) that calls for concrete recommendations for advancing investment to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In Africa, investment flows are predicted to decline 25-45 percent in 2020, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and low commodity prices, especially for oil. The region’s manufacturing and service industries, including aviation, hospitality, leisure, and tourism have also been “hit hard,” a trend that is projected to persist into the future. The report identifies two factors that “offer hope” for the recovery of investment flows in Asia: major global economies are recognizing ties to the continent and promoting investment in infrastructure and industrial development; and trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is deepening regional integration.

In Asia, investment flows are predicted to decline 45 percent in 2020. The pandemic caused lockdown measures and factory stoppages that impacted factories’ production and supply chains in the region. In addition, decreasing corporate earnings and the economic slowdown have resulted in multinational enterprises postponing investment plans.

In Latin America, investment flows are expected to halve in 2020. The pandemic has compounded structural weaknesses and political and social unrest, exacerbating foreign investment challenges and triggering a “deep recession.” These shocks are expected to have the most impact in the commodities, tourism, and transport sectors. In addition, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, which depend on FDI in extractive industries, will be hurt by low oil and commodity prices. The Caribbean is expected to be “hit hard” by the collapse in tourism. The region is also predicted to be “strongly affected” by the global slowdown in demand, particularly in trade with China and the US.

Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.

On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated “elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.

Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.

According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.

The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.

Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).

Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:

Summit on Biodiversity (proposed to reschedule to 30 September);

High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); and

High-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).

The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.

In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.

A virtual meeting to discuss the proposal took place on 12 June. Member States are invited to submit written comments by 19 June.","UN Member States and officials are considering changes to the format of the UN General Debate for the 75th UN General Assembly session and the surrounding high-level meetings in September 2020.
According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020.
Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall.

Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

In the first article in this series, it was noted that the SDGs can help us chart a path out of the current socioeconomic crisis and into a more resilient and regenerative future. At this point you may be thinking: Our company has already figured out our SDG approach. Well, before you get too comfortable, not all SDG responses are created equal.

The Future-Fit team has examined hundreds of sustainability reports over the past few years, and we’ve found that business responses to the SDGs typically follow one of three patterns: Defensive, Selective or Holistic.

Image credit: Future-Fit Foundation

Defending the status quo merely justifies ‘business as usual’

The first pattern is to defend the status quo — to tell a story about what the company is already doing on topics relating to the SDGs, rather than seeking out opportunities to change.

For example, a company which already has a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions might claim it is aligned with SDG 13 – Climate Action. But most of today’s GHG targets fall far short of the rapid decarbonisation trajectory we need.

Or a company might say it is contributing to SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – merely because it is creating jobs. But what if those jobs pay less than a living wage, or if working conditions are so onerous that employee wellbeing suffers?

Emphasising storytelling over action merely justifies business as usual — which is what got us into this mess in the first place.

A defensive approach to the SDGs may appeal to CEOs who still believe in the primacy of shareholder value, whereby companies exist only to deliver financial returns. But defensive claims lack both ambition and authenticity, and only leave companies open to accusations of SDG-washing.

Any company taking a defensive route is unlikely to attract and retain great employees, loyal customers, and increasingly-concerned investors.

A selective response can be counterproductive

The second pattern is to consider just one or a few of the 17 SDGs.

This selective approach is akin to the notion of Creating Shared Value: focusing on areas where the company’s current business model already intersects with a societal need.

For example, a pharmaceutical company may choose to focus on SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being – by making medicines that help people to live productive lives. Such efforts may indeed make a genuine contribution to SDG 3 — if the medicines are affordable and accessible to those who need them most.

But is that enough? What if manufacturing the medicines uses huge amounts of fresh water, and the production takes place in a water-stressed area? For local communities in that region, the company may actually be undermining SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation.

And what if that same company can only bring its medicines to market profitably by relying on low-cost suppliers who aren’t paying their workers a living wage? In that case, the company’s success may actually be slowing down progress toward SDG 1 – No Poverty.

The reality, of course, is that today’s companies exist only as part of a complex value web that touches multiple, interlinked systems: markets, communities, ecosystems and so on.

In this sea of complexity, linear notions of cause and effect start to evaporate — and without careful consideration, any action in one area can lead to undesirable consequences elsewhere.

So, a selective approach to the SDGs can be counterproductive: Even the most well-meaning company might be inadvertently exacerbating one problem attempting to solve while another.

Are such trade-offs acceptable? Possibly, but how can we be sure if we do nothing to identify and measure them?

A holistic approach measures and mitigates trade-offs

That brings us to the third pattern: taking a holistic approach — one which considers all of a company’s SDG impacts, both positive and negative, across the company’s value web.

No business decision is ever free of trade-offs. But if we take a systems approach — by looking at all interactions between the company and its suppliers, its customers, other socioeconomic actors, and the environment — it is possible to identify otherwise unforeseen issues. Negative trade-offs across the company’s value web can then be anticipated and avoided — or at the very least mitigated.

This kind of systems approach to managing extra-financial performance is crucial, because positive and negative impacts almost never cancel each other out. Greenhouse gas emissions are an exception: a ton of CO2 emitted in Johannesburg may be ‘neutralised’ by a ton of CO2 drawn down from the atmosphere in Tokyo. But other kinds of impact — product waste, water stress, land use change, human rights violations — cannot typically be netted out, across time or location.

Gradual improvements in one area, and the expense of exacerbating problems elsewhere, aren’t going to bring the SDGs in reach. We must eliminate — and eventually reverse — all of the damage done to our natural systems and social fabric; and that means striving to maximise the good while working consciously, continuously and collectively to eliminate the bad. Such a holistic response is essential if we are to make the SDGs a reality.

We can think of this third option as striving to create not just shareholder value, or even shared value, but system value.

Take a minute to scan your last sustainability report’s CEO statement, and to peel back the glossy SDG infographics. Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is holistic? Are you committed to creating system value?

If the answer is yes, that’s fantastic — and I’d love to hear from you, because such examples are few and far between. And if you’re not so sure, maybe the Future-Fit Business Benchmark can help you get there. Take a look at our SDG Explorer, which explains what every company must strive to do, to be sure it in no way undermines our collective progress toward a resilient and regenerative future.","Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

In the wake of the crisis, visibility and urgency on issues such as climate change, income inequality and human rights have risen and the five-step framework seeks to support investors in creating investment outcomes that are aligned with the UN goals, the PRI said in its report.

It comes as the investor organisation, with $89trn (€78trn) in assets managed by its signatories, has registered an increase in its members mentioning the SDGs in their reporting, with 650 in 2020, compared to 418 last year.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that meeting the 17 SDGs by 2030 will require $5trn to $7trn per year from the private sector, the PRI report said.

To support the SDGs, investors need to increase the positive outcomes and decrease the negative outcomes of their actions.

Investors need to redirect existing capital and engage with investees to improve positive outcomes.

The PRI report states that there is a continuous feedback cycle between environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities and (SDG-aligned) outcomes, shaped by investor actions (see figure 2 below).

This applies particularly for ‘universal owners’, who are long-term investors and so large that they hold a slice of the overall market.

“For such investors, overall economic performance will influence the future value of their portfolios more than the performance of individual companies or sectors, incentivising them to support sustainable growth and well-functioning financial markets,” the report noted.

Focusing on SDG outcomes allows investors to, for example:

identify opportunities, such as through changes to business models, across supply chains and through new and expanded products and services;

prepare for and respond to legal and regulatory developments, including those that may lead to asset stranding; and

protect their reputation and licence-to-operate (eg the trust of beneficiaries, clients and other stakeholders), particularly in the event of negative outcomes from investments.

The framework follows previous work by the PRI on the SDG investment case in 2017 and is the starting point for more work on the subject. It will also be the basis for future guidance and support, the report explained.

Next steps

Going forward, the PRI will work with signatories, who seek to shape outcomes in line with the SDGs, to provide best practices and develop a consensus on how to address common challenges, it said.

The PRI will also include an initial set of questions on shaping real-world outcomes in the pilot year of its new reporting framework in 2021.

Junko Nakagawa, president and chief executive of Nomura Asset Management, commented: “It is clear that large asset managers have a crucial role to play in supporting outcomes in line with the SDGs through both investments in equities and engagement with publicly-listed companies.

“Whilst we recognise the difficulties associated with pursuing impact through public investing for certain SDG targets, large public companies are among the most important stakeholders for achieving success. These companies have the resources, scale and investment power to bridge the huge funding gaps, while major asset managers are uniquely positioned to engage with these companies and help to enhance their impact.”

Darryl Murphy, managing director, infrastructure at Aviva Investors, said: “As long-term investors, we believe infrastructure – and real assets more broadly – have a critical role to play in moving towards a truly sustainable future.

“[The SDGs] help us to define objectives for a project and shape terms and conditions of an investment agreement, ensuring that borrowers adhere to certain practices and standards over the long-term.”

The five steps of the PRI’s framework are:","The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) has released a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, as it believes that the pandemic has increased expectations on investors to deliver on the goals.

The brief on ‘Achieving the SDGs through the COVID-19 response and recovery,’ released on 22 June 2020, reports that accelerating efforts to reach the SDGs will also better position countries to recover from COVID-19.

The SDGs can serve as preventive medicine against future shocks.

Moreover, progress on several SDGs that had been achieved before the pandemic can be seen mitigating its impacts. For example, the authors say, progress on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) has enabled more people to wash their hands regularly, an important strategy for containing the COVID-19 virus. Past progress on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and community) has reduced crowding and therefore virus exposure, and improved access to basic services. Past progress on SDG 3 has lessened pre-existing health conditions that can make COVID-19 cases more severe. Finally, progress on SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 9 (which includes internet access) have helped to mitigate the overall impacts of the pandemic.

Going forward, authors Shantanu Mukherjee and Astra Bonini suggest that the SDGs can serve as “preventive medicine against future shocks” as long as countries adopt more equitable and sustainable ways forward. These could include a just transition for workers to the green economy, elimination of fuel subsidies, and introduction of carbon taxes.

The brief also asserts that the world can move towards achieving the SDGs through “thoughtful and targeted” actions, including accelerating the universal provision of quality basic services, and protecting nature from further degradation.

DESA also issued a policy brief illuminating how forests can be “at the heart of a green recovery” from COVID-19. One aspect of this recovery is the role of healthy forests in reducing the risk of future pandemics, since habitat loss is associated with zoonotic infectious diseases. Forests also remove about one third of the world’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, thus helping to mitigate climate change, which is another driver of emerging zoonotic diseases and other epidemic diseases.

The forestry sector is labor-intensive, job training requirements are low, the work requires minimal planning and procurement, and social distancing is possible when doing forestry work. The brief identifies several countries that are utilizing forestry for job creation and including it in economic stimulus packages.

Forests serve as “safety nets for the rural poor,” providing food, income and nutritional diversity for about 20% of the global population, especially women, children, landless farmers, and other vulnerable segments of society. In addition, many indigenous peoples are coping with the pandemic by retreating deeper into forests for food, fuel and shelter, and to protect themselves from the risk of COVID-19 infection. It is also noted that reliance on firewood is likely to grow during the COVID-19 crisis, as supply chains of other energy sources get disrupted.

Finally, forests are needed to ensure availability of clean water for frequent handwashing. Three quarters of the planet’s accessible freshwater comes from forested watersheds. Forests also affect rainfall patterns, filter water, reduce soil erosion, and provide most of the drinking water for over one-third of the world’s largest cities.

Author Mita Sen highlights that a path to sustainable management of forests and trees has been charted in the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2030 with its Global Forest Goals, as well as in the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. As additions to these frameworks to support COVID-19 recovery, she suggests:

Post COVID-19 recovery programmes focused on forest-dependent people, indigenous peoples and local communities;

Investment in forestry-related jobs as part of COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages;

Strengthened national forest authorities and measures to combat illegal logging and illegal trade in wildlife; and

Timely and appropriately disaggregated official statistics on the status of forests, including on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress towards sustainable forest management.

The two policy briefs are part of a larger series being produced by DESA.

COVID-19 comes just as the public was beginning, slowly, to come to terms with the climate crisis and its far-reaching implications. The pandemic highlights how interconnected we are, and how impossible it is to disentangle the problems we all face in a globalized world. Holistic approaches to these problems are needed and they are needed fast. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), an umbrella term to describe a wide array of ecosystem-based actions that incorporate the natural environment to mitigate climate change and ensure ecosystem sustainability, has grown in prominence in recent years as potentially being such an approach.

Many companies are increasingly aware of the impact their unsustainable commodity production has on the environment and are recognizing that business cannot thrive in a world of environmental stress, poverty, and uncertainty. Some of those companies are starting to plan and implement preventive and restorative actions within their operations, with NbS providing a cost-effective tool to create a seemingly more responsible and sustainable forest-risk commodity value chain.

Detailed information on how companies are carrying out NbS within their operations, however, is still lagging. In a recent briefing, CDP analysed its 2019 Forests disclosure data on 543 companies that gathered information about the integration of NbS into their operations. We found that only 15% of companies reported having implemented any form of NbS, as well as a lack of consistency amongst those who did. The results spoke a clear message: we have a long way to go to encourage more widespread and ambitious implementation of NbS. As stated in the recent #TogetherWithNature statement, NbS must be considered a complementary approach to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, in addition to following a pathway of decarbonization, enacting comprehensive climate policies and enforcing proper accountability.

In the last year, NbS has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions on the environmental crisis. They featured heavily in the UN Climate Action Summit, particularly in the NbS Coalition co-led by China and New Zealand. At COP 25 in December, NbS were constituted a central theme in the high-level segments and the Santiago Call for Action on Forests. NbS are also set to take centre-stage in the negotiations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. For the private sector, it pays to be transparent, as businesses that disclose and take leading action on climate change can better identify and measure their environmental risks and opportunities. Data from STOXX has shown that CDP’s ‘A List’ has outperformed its global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a 7-year period.

The private sector presents a largely untapped opportunity for the implementation of NbS, when implemented in accordance with the best available science-based targets and with appropriate safeguards. As the COVID-19 crisis recedes, policymakers should seize the political momentum for the 2021 – 2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and recognize the role and participation of non-state actors in driving NbS, creating regulatory environments that are both institutionally and financially conducive for all stakeholders to take ambitious, measurable action. To start, they could:

1. Encourage corporate environmental disclosure

Disclosure is the bedrock of action. Corporate environmental disclosure needs to be more transparent and common, including for NbS. For this to occur, there needs to be improved regulatory frameworks to promote transparency in supply chains, fostering the integration of environmental protection assessments in business operations.

2. Mainstream NbS into legislation and regulatory frameworks for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development

Situating NbS as a cross-cutting policy tool within NDCs, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the SDGs (especially SDGs 12, 13 and 15) would not only help with the implementation of projects but would promote more accurate measurement of their effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

3. Improve the criteria, metrics and measurement of NbS

Whilst NbS are present in the majority of NDCs submitted to date, most of these do not include quantifiable targets. In order to harness private sector potential on the implementation of NbS and be part of a coherent global response to climate and biodiversity, there must be adequate and science-backed targets outlining the direction of action.

International policy efforts have multiple windows of opportunity to introduce integrated solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, and human development. All these issues are underpinned by our relationship with nature. Policymakers and corporate actors must engage in mutually supportive, ambitious, and carefully implemented action, to ensure that the potential of nature to be an important part of the solution to the current crises is unlocked.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations. (Since our previous update on VNR countries, Zimbabwe no longer appears on the list of second-time presenters).

The studies also present trends and perspectives for transitioning to safe alternatives.

The studies show that these countries have all experienced an increasing trend in the use of HHPs, which can permanently undermine human health and affect future generations. HHP poisoning can lead to chronic disability or death. An overall summary of the studies provides a snapshot of each country’s HHP use.

The Russia study highlights: partial contamination of land and adjacent environments with harmful substances due to long-term use of HHPs and agrochemicals in agriculture and forestry; challenges ensuring environmental safety due to a lack of effective state supervision over the safe handling of pesticides and agrochemicals in agricultural production; and environmental pollution in areas where obsolete and banned pesticides are stored.

In Armenia, more than 60% of pesticides allowed by legislation are HHPs, with one third of them categorized as carcinogens or possible carcinogens.

Many pesticides registered and officially used in Kazakhstan contain one or more active ingredients from the HHP list. The study from explains that, as of March 2019, 74 active ingredients belonging to HHPs are used in Kazakhstan, with 25 of the active ingredients banned in other countries. Of the 1,021 trade names of pesticides registered in Kazakhstan, 386 contain one or more active HHP substance.

In Uzbekistan, 59 HHPs are allowed for use, 34 of which are banned in other countries. Uzbekistan has established a database of laws and regulations governing the production, use, injury, and liability of individuals and legal entities and the sound management of chemicals, including the registration, licensing, and prevention of stockpiling of hazardous chemicals.

In Ukraine, the study concludes that among 3,966 preparatory forms of pesticides, 1,125 formulations contain one to three active ingredients of HHPs. Thus, around one third of pesticides and agrochemicals allowed for use in Ukraine are HHPs. Eighty-three active ingredients of HHPs in preparative forms of pesticides and agrochemicals are allowed for use in Ukraine, 41 of which are already prohibited in other countries.

Recommendations include: reducing and eventually eliminating HHPs in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia through increased information on safe HHP substitution, including use of the ecosystem-based approach and traditional knowledge in agriculture; and Regional Focal Points to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) collecting lessons learned from this process and sharing them with national officials to facilitate the switch from HHPs to safer alternatives.

The executive summaries are in English, while the full reports are provided in Russian. The studies were undertaken as a part of IPEN’s Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign, which focuses on international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral cooperation to support chemical safety and sound chemicals management and waste objectives beyond 2020. The Campaign contends that advancing chemical safety is necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It seeks to engage civil society organizations to further advance its objectives.

The studies are related to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land).

IPEN Participating Organizations have been undertaking activities related to the Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign since 2018. Activities address agroecology, chemicals in products, endocrine disrupting chemicals or POPs, hazardous chemicals in the lifecycle of electronics, HHPs, lead in paint, women and chemicals, workplace right-to-know, and/or zero waste issues.

In addition to the above five countries, activities are ongoing in Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Mozambique, the Philippines, Senegal, Serbia, Thailand, and Togo.","The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) has published a series of studies on the production and use of highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) in Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
Many pesticides registered and officially used in Kazakhstan contain one or more active ingredients from the HHP list.
The study from explains that, as of March 2019, 74 active ingredients belonging to HHPs are used in Kazakhstan, with 25 of the active ingredients banned in other countries.
Of the 1,021 trade names of pesticides registered in Kazakhstan, 386 contain one or more active HHP substance.
In Ukraine, the study concludes that among 3,966 preparatory forms of pesticides, 1,125 formulations contain one to three active ingredients of HHPs."

(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). The purpose of the HLPF, scheduled for 7-16 July 2020, is to evaluate the global implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Organizations are concerned that measures are not in place to ensure their meaningful participation in the meeting, which will take place virtually due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“We as churches have invested significantly in the implementation of the SDGs and our experience on the ground could contribute to global level discussions such as those in the HLPF”, says Isaiah Toroitich, LWF Head of Global Advocacy.

Fear that voices will be “muted”

The LWF through the initiative “Waking the Giant”, builds on the potential of the 148 LWF member churches to contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. At the national level, Waking the Giant helps to establish and strengthen the link between faith-based actors, relevant government ministries and UN agencies. It facilitates joint planning and new partnerships to further strengthen the churches’ engagement.

Like the almost 500 signatories of the letter, LWF also fears that the perspective gathered in working with local communities will be lost if the virtual conference does not open up sufficient spaces for civil society actors, including churches. The organizations urge the UN member states to adjust formal procedures in order to ensure visibility and participation of civil society.

“About people and communities”

As countries evaluate the efforts made to address issues such as civil freedoms, gender equality and poverty, “It is vital that civil society actors actively participate to provide insights into the impacts of efforts made to general populations around the world,” the letter reads.

“The SDGs are about people and communities,” Toroitich adds. “Without the meaningful participation of civil society in the High-level Political Forum, the entire agenda loses meaning. No one should be left behind in the SDGs work”.","“Experience on the ground can contribute to global discussions”(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF).

171,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/forests-and-pollinators-close-companions-with-a-shared-destiny/,"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Forests and Pollinators – Close Companions with a Shared Destiny,"Unobtrusive and often unobserved, the insects, birds, and mammals that help to keep plant populations diverse and abundant are easily overlooked as they go about their tasks. Yet their contribution to food production in terms of quantity, quality, and diversity is incalculable, through the act of pollination – that quintessential symbiosis, which allows animals to draw nectar from plants while transferring pollen so that plants can reproduce.

Most wild plants rely on pollinators for fruit and seed set, including more than 70 percent of global food crops, which are dependent on animal pollination for yield or quality improvements. An estimated 88 percent of wild flowering plants globally are pollinated by animals. These include wild bees, butterflies, hoverflies, wasps, moths, and bats, to name but a few. Worldwide, there are around 20,000 species of bees alone but, together with other important pollinators, their numbers are dwindling – and with them the services that they provide to the ecosystem and to humanity.

Habitat fragmentation and intensive agricultural management are the main culprits, both of which have transformed natural landscapes beyond recognition over the past 50 years, triggering a domino effect that has serious repercussions for food security and livelihoods, compromising resilience to threats such as climate change and pathogens.

An essential source of pollination services, forests host a rich and complex array of nesting and foraging sites, and their presence is essential for the continued survival of a whole range of valuable insects and other animal pollinators. The close relationship within this tight-knit ecosystem means that the survival prospects of both parties are intertwined: pollinators rely on forests for their homes and food, while forests themselves depend on the services of pollinators for their natural regeneration and resilience through genetic diversity.

Perhaps ironically, despite the readiness of some landowners to rip out every tree or hedge, there is evidence that agricultural production can actually benefit from the presence of nearby forests and trees. It has been shown that agricultural landscapes adjoining fragmented forests and natural areas benefit from pollinator services, with animal-pollinated crops achieving higher fruit set as a result. For example, in West Java, Indonesia, an increase in tree cover – using mixed-tree agroforestry rather than monocrop rice paddy fields – led to 93 percent of the crop pollinators found in natural forest being maintained, with consequent benefits to agricultural production.

In some forest settings, especially in tropical countries, non-wood forest products such as Brazil nuts, latex, and palm fruits are essential sources of revenue for local communities, and pollinators play a critical role in assuring their reproduction. In India, a study found that 40 percent of 139 species important for local livelihoods benefited directly from biotic pollination, generally by bees and other insects. Açaí palm, a source of income for around 25,000 forest-dependent people in the Amazon River Delta, with an annual market value of USD 149 million, is highly dependent on biotic pollination, but intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and the ecosystem function of pollinators.

Climate change is likely to aggravate the precarious position of many of the planet’s pollinators. Extreme temperatures and events are affecting the animals and their habitats, while also leading to changes in the plants with which they have such a delicate relationship, affecting leaf unfolding, flowering, and fruit maturation. In Brazil, climate change is predicted to lead to a decline in yields of key crops such as tomatoes and coffee due to reduced pollination.

Landscape and forest management practices, especially those that promote a mosaic approach, can help to ensure the continued availability of pollinators and thereby increase resilience and productivity of both forestry and agriculture. Building connections between fragmented habitats, particularly through biological corridors or stepping stones made up of agroforestry, groups of trees or even single trees, has been shown to have a powerful effect in promoting the movement of pollinators and restoring their establishment and beneficial services.

Within forests themselves, practices that are conducive to maintaining healthy pollinator populations include regulating grazing in forests to minimize competition for floral resources, retaining dead standing and lying wood for nesting, and conducting selective logging, burning, mowing, coppicing, and thinning. In Germany, selective thinning was shown to increase flower budding, leading to a greater abundance of pollinators. It also resulted in improved fortunes for the threatened capercaillie through increased fruit setting of the bird’s main food source, the bilberry.

Despite their critical importance to food security, the role of pollinators has not been given sufficient attention in practitioners’ circles, especially in connection with forests. Yet the sustainable management of forests for pollination services can help to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, in particular SDG 15 (life on land). A new report, ‘The Pollination Services of Forests,’ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and Bioversity International, presents a range of measures that forest and land managers could take to retain pollinators in forests and landscapes.

Any real progress in halting the loss of animal pollinators will involve innovative policy instruments, which create incentives for pollinators to be nurtured, such as payments for pollination services to land users who adopt landscape management practices that can attract and maintain pollinator populations. Let us remember the urgency of acting to protect our pollinators and make sure that we act now.

Saturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

The update, posted to the EOHU website shortly after 2 p.m., showed three new cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, and one in Prescott-Russell. This brings the total number of confirmed cases within the EOHU region to 158 and represents the largest single-day jump in weeks.

Three of the cases are dated to Thursday, with one Wednesday and the last on Friday. The EOHU does not hold its briefings on weekends, so any further information about these five new cases, and any added to the count on Sunday, will await Monday afternoon’s briefing. Based on the episode dates alone, none of these new cases should be related to the region entering Stage 2 on Friday.

The EOHU also noted two additional resolved cases, both in Prescott-Russell. That leaves 21 unresolved cases in Prescott-Russell, four in SDG, and five in Cornwall. Another bright spot is that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Foyer St- Viateur in Limoges was declared over on Saturday— it dated back to a staff member testing positive. An outbreak was declared for a second time at the Pinecrest long-term care facility in Plantagenet on Wednesday, after an asymptomatic staff member tested positive. All residents and staff members at the facility will be tested again.","Three new COVID-19 cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, one in Prescott-RussellArticle contentSaturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

MANILA – Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Alfonso Cusi said the Philippines is on track to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number seven, or the access to affordable and clean energy.

In his speech at the virtual 5th Global Conference on Energy Efficiency of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Tuesday evening (Manila time), Cusi said the Philippine government continues to develop energy efficiency and conservation framework and create policies to promote economic gains of energy conservation.

“Our strategies are anchored upon attaining the twin goals of energy security and sustainability,” he said. “Without sacrificing the achievement of national energy security, we continue to support the development and utilization of renewable resources and technology.”

Cusi said government policies that push for clean energy include renewable portfolio standards that mandates utility companies to source a minimum portion of energy from renewable resources; the Green Energy Option Program that empowers consumers to source their consumption from renewable energy resources; and the proposed Green Energy Pricing Program, which will augment renewable energy capacity in the grid.

He also invited investors in the energy sector to look into opportunities in the Philippines, with its growing population and rising power demand, as well as its target to be energy self-sufficient.

“It is important for the Philippines to be energy self-sufficient. We cannot be at the mercy of global energy market volatilities and other geopolitical movements,” he added.

The DOE chief said the country is pushing for exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and revitalizing the upstream oil and gas sector.

It also finds ways to develop and promote indigenous resources like hydropower and geothermal, he said.

The Philippines, he added, also pursues technology neutral policy in the power sector that welcomes all forms of technology to help the country achieve its capacity targets at the soonest possible time.

With the technology neutral policy, Cusi said the DOE is also pushing for the utilization of nuclear power.

“I strongly believe it is high time for the Philippines to be open to the idea. Nuclear power is a reliable alternative to attain energy sufficiency and meet future power demands,” he said.

Below is the Nigeria Country Report No. 2020/177, titled ""Nigeria: Technical Assistance Report-Additional Spending Toward Sustainable Development Goals"", issued in April 2020.

Preface

In response to a request from the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), a technical mission visited Abuja, Nigeria during January 29-February 11, 2020 to collaborate on an assessment of the spending associated with making substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mission comprised Mauricio Soto (head) and Mariano Moszoro (all FAD), and Julieth Pico (FAD expert).

This technical mission was financed by the European Union under the EU-IMF Public Financial Management Partnership Program (PFM-PP).

The mission was hosted by D.M. Dauda (Secretary of Programme, OSSAP-SDGs) and Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa (Senior Technical Advisor, OSSAP-SDGs).

The mission met with Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed (Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning), Prince Clem Ikanade Agba (Minister of State for Budget and National Planning), and Suleiman H, Adamu (Minister of Water Resources). The mission also met with Didi Walson-Jack (Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power), Emmanuel Meribole (Director, Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Health), Babangida Hussaini (Director of Special Projects, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing), and Adeoye E.O. (Acting Director, Department of Educational Planning, Research, and Development, Federal Ministry of Education).

The mission also met Katrine Mulvad Thomsen (Team Leader, Economic Cooperation and Energy, European Union Delegation), Amarakoon Bandara (Senior Economic Advisor, UNDP), Shubham Chaudhuri (Country Director, World Bank), Moses Ongom (Health System Adviser, WHO), Anthony Simpasa (Lead Economist, African Development Bank), and other staff of development partners.

The mission expresses its sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support given by officials and staff of these various organizations with whom the mission met. The team is especially grateful to Chukwuemeka Olanrewaju Ogbuehi (Ministry of Finance), Ogunleye Femi (OSSAPSDG), and Zainab Mangga (IMF Resident Representative Office) for the excellent coordination and support during the mission. The mission is also thankful to Laraba Bonet (IMF Resident Representative Office) for facilitating mission logistics.

Since the mission took place before COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the report does not reflect the impact from COVID-19 on economic activity in Nigeria. The report focuses on some of the medium-term challenges that Nigeria will face after the COVID-19 crisis, namely the additional spending needed to ensure substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Executive Summary

Making progress in the SDGs requires substantial additional resources. Concomitant with the reform priorities identified by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and other international development institutions, the mission estimates additional spending of 18 percentage points of GDP by 2030-a level higher than the average low-income and developing countries. Relative to other low-income and developing countries, additional spending is higher in education and water and sanitation, and lower in health, electricity, and roads (Figure).

Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. The authorities have made important progress in developing long-term plans in sectors such as health, electricity, and water and sanitation.

Education-increasing access and improving quality. The relatively low resources devoted to education are insufficient to deliver quality education for all. With 50 percent of the population in school-age, we estimate that total annual spending in education would need to increase by 7.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. A pragmatic approach should be taken depending on resource availability. For example, expanding enrollment could be done at a more modest cost of some 1 percentage points of GDP.

Health-tackling inefficiencies. Nigeria should deliver better outcomes at its current level of spending. Rebalancing the system, with an emphasis on primary care with public support, is critical. In the medium-term, additional annual spending of 4 percentage points of GDP would be needed to expand health workers, improve infrastructure, and improve health outcomes.

Electricity-rehabilitating and expanding power infrastructure. Annual investments of 1 percent of GDP are needed to expand electricity access and keep up with population growth. Rehabilitating the existing capacity can help meeting part of these investments. Mini-grids can play an important role in mobilizing capacity to remote and vulnerable communities.

Roads-expanding the road network. Increasing access roads from 26 to 75 percent of the rural population will cost 2 percent of annual GDP. It is critical to outline the road network and identify projects with high economic and social returns. The private sector can play an important role in this sector, supported by strong oversight to ensure value for money.

Water and sanitation-picking low-hanging fruit. A priority is improving access for the most vulnerable. Ending open defecation and expanding basic water and sanitation can be achieved at a modest annual cost of 0.6 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, providing safely managed water and sanitation for all will cost an additional 2.5 percent of annual GDP.





Beyond resources, improving coordination and strengthening governance is critical to delivering on the SDGs. The federal administration through its Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) is committed to advance towards the 2030 goals. In line with policy options outlined by the World Bank and the United Nations, progress in these sectors requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by strong coordination between the federal, state, and local administrations.

While development partners and the private sector can help, the government should be in the driving seat of these efforts. To support decision-making based on evidence, one priority is to collect and analyze data to inform best practices and better target scarce resources.

Article content The 1st Battalion of the Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders celebrate its 80th anniversary Saturday. Tim Gault’s father, Ralph Gault, was a member of the 1st Battalion of the Highlanders, a Second World War veteran. He’s been associated with the group since 1929, when he signed on with a regiment when he was 13 years old. He served as a lieutenant and ended his career as a captain after many stints overseas.

SDG Highlanders mark battalion's 80th anniversary Back to video The 1st Battalion was formed with officers and men coming from four eastern Ontario Units – Headquarters Company from The Prince of Wales Rangers (Peterborough), A Company from The Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment (Kingston), B Company from The Brockville Rifles (Brockville), and C Company, D Company, and the Band from our Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders (Cornwall). The Highlanders were received orders to form the battalion and its start dates to June 20, 1940. The Glens became part of the 3rd Division’s 9th Brigade — the Highland Brigade — with The Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders, The Highland Light Infantry, and The North Nova Scotia Highlanders

Article content Gault attended and qualified as a sergeant signal instructor at the Royal Canadian Corp of Signals in Camp Borden. “He instructed and trained the SDG Highlanders signal platoon through the 1930s,” said Gault. “He was the RSM, which stands for regimental sergeant major, of the Cornwall Collegiate Institute, a cadet core in 1932 and later as a lieutenant, organized and instructed a school of cadets.” Gault Sr. was appointed to the 2nd Battalion of the Highlanders and then volunteered for active service and attended the officer’s training school, went on to instruct at two training centres before being posted to England in 1943. “In England, he attended two battle schools, and qualified at the anti-tank school in England,” said Gault. “He then instructed in anti-tank warfare. He went from the 2nd Battalion to the 1st Battalion, being the active force in Europe.” Gault was wounded just before the liberation of Boulogne. He became an active supporter of the 1st Battalion Association, helping organizing tours, arranging for memorial plaques, and planning reunions. The association recognized him as an honourary life member. “My father was wounded, hit by shrapnel by a German motor grenade, wounded in the right side of his head, forearm and leg,” said Gault. “He was evacuated to England.” He spent four months in the hospital, next four to five months on rehabilitation and training reinforcements – anti tank – and was then appointed chief instructor later on.

He passed away in 2001. “When my mother passed away in 1984, he got back involved with the 1st Battalion Association and I got involved with it as well, because he and I did pretty much everything together,” said Gault. The battalion’s association would normally hold an in-person reunion around the anniversary of D-Day on June 6, which was cancelled this year due the pandemic. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Article content This article has been edited to correct the expected opening date for services at St. Peter’s. Churches throughout the region will slowly be reopening in the coming days and weeks, allowing for in-person masses to resume with 30 per cent capacity. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Religious services start resuming this weekend in Cornwall/SDG Back to video The decision to do so by the area’s many religious organizations was made following the announcement from the Ontario government on Monday, that several regions throughout Ontario would be entering the second phase of its three-phase reopening plan. Two of the Archdiocese of Ottawa-Cornwall’s local churches will be opening this weekend — St. Columban’s and Blessed Sacrament. “We’ve been given a lot of rules,” said archdiocese representative Kimberly Walsh. “There are a lot of things to put into place and therefore I believe this is why the reopening is not happening in all the parishes this weekend. One of the biggest issues in many of the parishes is how do you accommodate only 30 per cent capacity and social distance rules all while being fair. This is a dilemma that I know the parishes are definitely grappling with.

Article content “Going to mass is not simply going to a regular meeting of an organization. Mass is the source and summit of our faith, and it’s when we receive Jesus’ real presence in the Eucharist. We’ve not been able to do this for thee months, and missed the most important liturgical feasts of the season: Holy Week, Easter Sunday, the 50-day Easter season, Pentecost – hence the difficult dilemma.” St. Francis de Sales and Blessed Sacrament on the other hand, will open their doors over the next weekend. The opening Ste-Thérèse-de-Lisieux might not take place until the last weekend of June, with an opening date for St. Peter’s not yet confirmed— but it will likely be in July. A strict set of safety measures are to be implemented in churches that are reopening. These include only using one door to enter and one door to exit, the encouraged wearing of masks or face coverings and keeping a six feet distance between parishioners. In addition Holy Water won’t be available at St Columban’s. Parishioners are also being asked by the diocese to not engage in singing, in order to limit the potential spread of the virus. Communion will also be altered — only to be received in the hand. “You are to place one open hand flat upon the other to receive the Sacred Host,” reads a document from the diocese. “Communicants are instructed to remove their masks, using the straps and without touching the front of their masks, while the person ahead of them is receiving Holy Communion.”

Robert Adams indicated to the Standard-Freeholder the regathering of the congregation might take place, in July and only if safety precautions have been put in place. “Our one key goal is to ensure that our worship space is safe for all people,” he said. “The last thing that we want is to be an infection hotspot that endangers our members and the broader community.” Adams went on to say that the biggest challenge they currently face is the continuous sanitation of their church. “We have already started to look at spacing people throughout the sanctuary to maintain social distancing and we will be discussing things like masks for all people who enter the building for worship,” he said. “But with a large building, we recognize there is a real challenge to sanitizing the space each week.” He additionally said his church would also ask parishioners not to sing for the time being. “We know that some of our people will not feel comfortable in large crowds just yet,” Adams added. “So we are also making upgrades to our technology so that we can continue to livestream our services. That is an area of ministry that has been very well-received during our time away from the sanctuary.” Services at the church will also be impacted if there is a spike in local COVID-19 cases.

The Government of Ghana has set up a private-sector advisory group to help achieve certain targets set under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).



The private advisory group is composed of some selected distinguished Chief Executive Officers namely, Mr. Edward Effah, Mrs. Kate Quartey-Papafio, Mr. Alhassan Andani, among many others.



The mandate of the private sector advisory group is to establish the green fund to support the activities to be undertaken by government in five key thematic areas namely Goal 4 (quality education), Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth) and Goal 12 (responsible production and consumption).



In an interview with the media, Mrs. Kate Quartey-Papafio said she is of the firm belief that post-COVID-19 the private sector advisory group shall play a very significant role in helping to restore the growth of the economy because these outlined focus areas for the group are very significant and will contribute massively to national development.



Mrs. Papafio said these goals are interconnected and can work together to deliver growth and unprecedented development for the good people of Ghana.



She said it anchored in the vision of the project to be self-reliant in economic transformation, inclusive growth and the realisation of the SDGs in Ghana, and would be delivered through five Results Areas and cross-cutting priorities as mentioned.



She emphasized that all corporate organizations working in the country should make it a priority to support this projects in a form contributing towards the fund and further extended the call to Ghanaian owned businesses situated outside the jurisdiction to come fully on board to help make this initiative a success



She said being an Energy Personality of the year she will use all her effort together with that of the group to ensure that the target on rural renewable energy initiative and specific environmentally sustainable projects are achieved comprehensively.","General News of Friday, 12 June 2020Source: Anthony Mensah, ContributorThe Government of Ghana has set up a private-sector advisory group to help achieve certain targets set under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).

Many of the messages about data during the HLPF were not new; the importance of good data in tracking SDG implementation has been consistently underlined at every session. Nonetheless, the availability and uses of data change each year. Due to time lags in datasets, many of the data reports published during the first years after 2015 provided baseline assessments that let us know where we were starting rather than where we were going. Some of the reports launched in 2020 now focus on data collected since 2015. In March 2020, the UN Statistical Commission adopted 36 changes to the SDG indicators, which will affect indicator datasets in future years.

A consistent call during the last five years has been the need to strengthen statistical capacity to address data gaps through investment in data and statistics. This policy brief offers an overview of some of the data platforms and indicator sources that are currently available, to assist our readers in tracking SDG implementation as well as to stimulate thinking about where SDG indicator investments are needed.

Global SDG Assessments and Datasets

A starting point for thinking about SDG global datasets is to look at the key reports that are released prior to the annual HLPF session:

The SDG Progress Report and the Sustainable Development Goals Report rely on data from the UN Statistics Division’s Open SDG Data Hub. The data in this set are maintained by the custodian agencies for each of the indicators. In 2020, a SDG Progress Chart was also developed using this dataset to provide graphs for selected SDG targets showing how well each region is doing.

SDSN’s annual Sustainable Development Report incorporates a variety of datasets into its rankings of countries according to how well they are implementing the SDGs. In 2020, SDSN released an additional resource: ‘SDGs Today: The Global Hub for Real-Time SDG Data‘. This portal, which was developed in partnership with Esri and the National Geographic Society, provides access to datasets that are updated regularly and have been produced within the last year. The datasets are selected “based on the level of frequency, quality, international comparability, public availability, and ease of understanding.”

Several other platforms permit the user to explore SDG-related data through visualizations and other features:

IISD’s Global SDG Indicator Platform incorporates data from the Open SDG Data Hub into a user-friendly tool that permits the exploration of data through global maps. The Platform’s “dashboard” feature permits users to compare the data for two nations.

The SDG Tracker presents data from the Our World in Data database, which uses official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. The SDG Tracker offers charts and maps to view the status of progress on the SDG targets.

Resource Watch provides access to hundreds of datasets on the state of the planet’s resources and citizens. It provides dashboards for datasets on the ocean, energy, forests, cities, climate, water, food and society.

Country and Issue Specific Datasets

The Resource Watch “about” page highlights that, while “more data are available today than ever before,” policymakers, business leaders, and analysts often cannot access the data they need to make informed decisions about the environment and human well-being. The global platforms and datasets seek to increase transparency and access to data globally. The data ecosystem is enhanced with issue and region or country specific data platforms, which can sort through the large amounts of data and bring context and targeted functions specific to an audiences’ data needs. Such data platforms include the following:

The UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) data dashboard to help its member countries monitor their progress on the 2030 Agenda. The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators;

The Goal Tracker for South Africa, which provides information about South Africa’s national policies related to achieving the SDGs and seeks to offer tools for decision-making, resource allocation and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders in support of the SDGs;

The World Bank’s Sovereign ESG Data Portal, an online platform that provides sovereign-level environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, to support efforts by the financial sector to improve the sustainability of their investments by better aligning ESG analysis with key sustainable development policy indicators; and

The SDG 6 Data Portal, which provides snapshots of global, regional, and national performance on SDG 6 indicators, as well as data visualizations and animations showing changes that have occurred over time.

Community indicator systems, which organize data based on community-identified priorities, are supporting local-level SDG implementation (see for example this story about IISD’s headquarters city of Winnipeg, Canada).

2020 Target

Many studies of indicators provide as much information about where investments in data would be usefully applied as they do about where we are going on SDG implementation. The sustainable development community is acting on this information: the landscape of data platforms looks different now than it did for a policy update on data platforms published in March 2018. We will watch as it continues to evolve, especially in the coming months.

Data collection is the subject of one of the “2020 targets” (17.18: By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts). The reason this target has an accelerated completion date is also a reason for the interest in data: SDG implementation will be measured and driven through monitoring, based on the indicators. Watch this space for news about these critical tools for driving the 2030 Agenda forward.","This policy brief offers an overview of some of the data platforms and indicator sources that are currently available, to assist our readers in tracking SDG implementation as well as to stimulate thinking about where SDG indicator investments are needed.

Nonetheless, growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent inequalities remain and have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

On the issues of poverty, healthcare, and education, the 2020 edition of this annual report documents:

the first rise in global poverty since 1998, with an estimated 71 million people expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020;

the disruptions to health and vaccination services and limited access to diet and nutrition services could cause hundreds of thousands of additional under-5 deaths and tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths in 2020; and

school closures have kept 90% of students worldwide out of school.

This report was launched at the opening of the 2020 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2020), on 7 July. The report uses data as of June 2020 for selected indicators in the global indicator framework for the SDGs, as developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 July 2017.

The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 is the third of three global assessments on SDG progress that are released in preparation for the annual HLPF session. The yearly report of the UN Secretary-General on progress towards the 17 SDGs (SDG Progress Report) is released several months before the HLPF. The 2020 edition reported that progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) annually releases a Sustainable Development Goals Report along with indexes that list countries by SDG achievement. Their 2020 edition focuses on ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Covid-19.’ The report indicates that all regions have made progress in the SDG index since 2015, with East and South Asia having progressed the most.","The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 finds that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world had been making progress in several areas, including maternal and child health and access to electricity.

The report titled, ‘WTO Contribution to the 2020 HLPF,’ highlights that the multilateral trading system has contributed to “unprecedented economic development” over the last few decades, and observes that increased certainty over trade policies has resulted in predictability and created the conditions for long-term business planning and investment. The report underscores the role of trade, fiscal, and monetary policies in achieving the SDGs and supporting sustainable development. For example, the report highlights discussions with the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment on domestic initiatives on waste and chemicals management and recycling and on how trade policy can support the circular economy. In addition, the Aid for Trade initiative contributes to SDG target 8a (increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs)), and gender-responsive trade policies contribute to increasing women’s participation in global trade (in line with SDG 5) while contributing to economic growth (in line with SDG 8).

The report provides a review of the WTO’s efforts on SDG 14.6 on prohibiting fisheries subsides that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and on SDG 17.10 on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system. The report states that discussions on reducing harmful fisheries subsidies are playing a critical role in advancing developing countries’ sustainable development objectives.

The report recommends that governments mainstream trade into their national development plans, including by defining a clear national trade policy, ensuring effective institutional coordination, and integrating trade into sector strategies. To support progress on SDG 17.11 (doubling LDCs’ share in global trade by 2020), the report emphasizes the need for measures that address challenges faced by LDCs in international trade to ensure a more equitable distribution of trade benefits.

The report also considers the potential impact of COVID-19 on global trade, and shares steps taken by WTO members to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reflects that the COVID-19 crisis has had a “major impact” on global supply and demand, resulting in disruptions of global supply chains for goods and services, and concludes that expectations of recovery in the value of world trade “will need to be revised downwards.” The report welcomes the introduction of fiscal and monetary measures by governments to prevent social lockdowns from creating large-scale business failure and job losses. The WTO emphasizes the importance of maintaining open trade and investment flows to protect jobs, reduce disruptions in global supply chains, and ensure that products are available for all.

The virtual launch of the Framework was co-chaired by Gilbert F. Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. Over 600 participants logged into the launch event, which featured statements from the heads of UN agencies and stakeholders, and a closing statement from António Guterres, UN Secretary-General.

The Framework will seek to support accelerated country progress in five key areas of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): financing; data and information; capacity development; innovation; and governance. Speakers emphasized the value of UN efforts to deliver as one at the country level and interlinkages between action on SDG 6 and other SDGs.

Houngbo highlighted that the framework introduces an annual moment for stocktaking and sharing of best practices. He also called attention to the importance of World Water Day in 2023, when the midterm review of the implementation of the International Decade for Action “Water for Life” will take place. Several speakers noted that this event will be the first UN high-level conference on water since the 1970s.

Among the elements and objectives of the Framework that speakers highlighted were the following:

Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly, commended the Framework’s focus on strengthening multistakeholder participation;

Achim Steiner, Administrator, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted the value of linking to governance frameworks (SDG 16);

Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), stressed the importance of a multilateral approach, given that much of the world’s freshwater flows across international boundaries;

Qu Dongyu, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), stressed the need to address water scarcity;

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized that water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are essential for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic;

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), stressed the need for addressing WASH needs of slum dwellers and for ensuring that data can inform decision making and investment decisions;

Olga Algayerova, Executive Secretary, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), noted that the Water Convention provides a unique legal platform for addressing shared waters;

Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), discussed the links between efforts to address climate change adaptation and water related services and science; and

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), stressed the need to understand the hydrological cycle, the value of ecosystems, and how much water is embodied in our consumption patterns.

In his closing statement, Secretary-General Guterres stressed that the water and sanitation crisis demands a holistic approach, noted that it cuts across all of the pillars of UN, and said he was pleased to see the focus on action at the country level.

The launch took place on 9 July 2020, during a special event on the sidelines of the 2020 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The silence procedure was used to finalize the declaration.

On 7 July 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated a letter informing that consensus on the text of the declaration had been reached.

Following consultations on a draft that Co-facilitators Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden, shared on 5 June 2020, further revisions were introduced. The Co-facilitators shared the revised draft on 17 June.

Among other changes, in the preambular section, instead of “Through its Charter, which is the cornerstone of international law, [the UN] has determined that all nations – whether large or small – should be treated with sovereign equality and with respect to their territorial integrity, political independence, and the right to self-determination of peoples,” the text was revised to read “The Charter of the United Nations, which is the cornerstone of international law, has declared the principle of sovereign equality of all States, and the right to self-determination of peoples.” The paragraph was also amended to include an additional sentence: “[The UN] has determined that all States shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

Under the commitment to promote peace and prevent conflicts, instead of “Rules governing the use of force must be respected,” the text was revised to read “We reiterate the importance of abiding by the Charter, principles of international law, and relevant resolutions of the Security Council.” Instead of “Terrorism is among the most critical threats to international peace and security,” the commitment was revised to read “Terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism are serious threats to international peace and security.”

The commitment to upgrade the UN was revised to include an additional sentence: “We reiterate our call for reforms of three of the principle organs of the United Nations.”

In the concluding section, instead of “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common good of present and future generations,” the text was amended to read “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common good of present and future generations and to realize our shared vision for a common future.” After silence was broken on this sentence, Muhammad-Bande proposed to substitute the sentence with “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common future of present and coming generations.”

On the commitment to protect our planet, “one Member State” expressed concern about the sentence “We need to immediately curb greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda.” Following consultations, Muhammad-Bande proposed language incorporating “complementary factual information”: “We need to immediately curb greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns in line with applicable State commitments to the Paris Agreement and in line with the 2030 Agenda.” Following this revision, the silence procedure concluded without objections.

In a statement, the UN Association – UK (UNA-UK) expressed concern about the new language referencing applicable State commitments under the Paris Agreement, warning that a focus on the State commitments element “gives the dangerous and erroneous impression that the Paris Agreement can be reduced to the self-defined commitments” of Member States.

Muhammad-Bande will transmit the final draft to the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – to prepare the text for adoption at the high-level meeting of the Assembly to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020.","UN Member States have arrived at consensus on the text of the declaration for the commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary (UN75).

Only one of the 2020 regional forums on sustainable development was held as scheduled. Three were postponed, and one was scaled down and held virtually due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The note (E/HLPF/2020/3) states that the regional commissions have convened regional forums on sustainable development since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to “discuss follow-up and review of the Agenda at the regional level and to prepare for the reviews of the high-level political forum.”

The sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development was held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, from 24-27 February 2020. The forum convened on the theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ bringing together more than 3,000 participants, including ministers and government representatives from 52 UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) member States, intergovernmental organizations, UN bodies and specialized agencies, major groups, and other stakeholders.

According to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add. 1), the forum provided an opportunity to translate into action the proclamation of the 2020s as a decade of action and delivery for sustainable development, endorsed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in resolution 74/4. The principal activities carried out during the forum included: regional follow-up and review of progress made in implementing the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; peer learning through sharing approaches, experiences, and lessons learned in conducting voluntary national and local reviews; and identifying and articulating priorities, policy options, and recommendations of Africa in the form of key messages.

Key messages emanated from:

the high-level panel on accelerators to deliver a transformed and prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 within the decade 2020-2030;

discussions of the progress report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 at the regional and subregional levels;

plenary round tables on: voluntary national reviews (VNRs) on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; VNRs and peer learning on implementation, follow-up, and review of the two agendas; the sub-theme of people; and the sub-theme of partnerships;

parallel meetings on the sub-themes of prosperity, the planet, and peace;

the 2020 session of the Africa Science, Technology and Innovation Forum;

major groups and other stakeholders;

deliberations on support from the UN development system to implement the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; and

a youth forum.

In the outcome document from the forum, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the United Nations Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ forum participants call upon all African countries to “urgently revisit frameworks for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063” and to “align their national development plans with the principles of the two agendas.” They call upon the UN development system and partners to scale up support of African countries’ capacity development in “transformational” areas such as climate action, youth, education, entrepreneurship and innovation, empowerment of women and persons with disabilities, food systems, health, data and statistics, and trade, among others.

The fourth session of the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the Economic Commission for Europe Region took place virtually on 19 March 2020. Participants from UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member States, UN entities and other international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, the private sector, and other organizations discussed: accelerating action and delivery for sustainable development in the region; accelerating SDG progress through VNRs; actions for green and inclusive change; and economic transformation, finance, and technology for SDG acceleration. Additional segments held as webinars addressed SDG challenges and leveraging data and statistics for SDG progress.

The Chair’s summary of the discussions, annexed to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.2), highlights that, despite good progress in many areas of sustainable development, in Europe, no country is on track to achieving the SDGs, citing “considerable challenges” with SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).

Discussions sought to identify the main lessons learned from the VNR process and ways to improve reviews in the next HLPF cycle. Participants shared experiences from Azerbaijan, Romania, Switzerland, the Russian Federation, and civil society.

Originally scheduled from 25-27 March, the seventh session of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was held virtually on 20 May 2020, with more than 730 registered participants from governments, intergovernmental organizations, the UN, international organizations, civil society, and other entities. The forum focused on the theme, ‘Accelerating Action for and Delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific.’

Participants discussed actions supporting the global decade of action for the SDGs in the region, focusing on the transformative processes needed to face socioeconomic, cultural, and institutional barriers to change, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The forum also provided an opportunity to share examples of successful strategic policies in the region and national and regional perspectives on strengthening the follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda.

The Chair’s summary of the discussions, annexed to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.3), identifies six transformative entry points to accelerate progress, derived from the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019: human well-being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; food systems and nutrition patterns; affordable and clean energy; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. It notes that stronger follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda need to be part of the solution, and cites a call for stronger links between the regional and global processes for reviewing the 2030 Agenda.

The fourth meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, originally scheduled to be held in Havana, Cuba, from 28-31 March 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 and 12 May, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) organized two virtual meetings of the community of practice of the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries submitting VNRs to the HLPF in 2020.

The input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.4) highlights ‘Sustainable Development Goal Gateway’ – an inter-agency regional knowledge platform that serves as an entry point to all the information on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs in the region, and a document titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the New Global and Regional Context: Scenarios and Projections in the Current Crisis,’ which gives an overview of the main economic, social, and environmental trends that influence the achievement of the SDGs in LAC and offers analysis of progress on the basis of 72 statistical series of SDG indicators in the region.

In light of the “weak and uneven progress” towards the SDGs and the response to the pandemic, ECLAC puts forward the following recommendations:

Coordinate a powerful fiscal stimulus at the international level to support health services and to protect jobs and the income of people in general;

Keep international supply chains open, in particular those for medicine and medical equipment, food and energy;

Bolster mechanisms to guarantee companies’ liquidity, payment chains and the stability of the financial system;

Defer external debt servicing for highly indebted countries to increase their fiscal space; and

Develop new financial instruments to directly support countries with little to no fiscal space.

The input document also summarizes discussions held during virtual meetings of ECLAC subsidiary bodies and regional dialogue platforms to advance the 2030 Agenda amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.5) from the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development notes that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting of the forum, due to be held from 7-9 April 2020, was postponed until a later date that “has yet to be decided.” The document indicates that the forum’s programme of work will be updated to “include consideration of the challenges arising from the pandemic and its implications for health care, its socioeconomic consequences and its impact on progress towards sustainable development in the Arab region.”

The input document contains key messages to the HLPF, drawn from consultations with representatives of the Arab States during two regional workshops on VNRs, organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the League of Arab States. The messages address the following themes:","The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) published a note consolidating inputs to the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) from the five UN regional commissions.

Addressing climate change is a crucial part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, yet countries have made little progress on this goal. In the years ahead, countries have to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can join us in taking action on this issue here

Dozens of developing nations across the globe have achieved the targets for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action — reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate resilience — while developed countries remain far behind, according to a recent report by the UN.

The Sustainable Development Report 2020 notes that 43 countries in Africa have achieved the targets for SDG 13, alongside more than a dozen other countries throughout Asia and Latin America. Moldova is the only country in Europe to have achieved SDG 13.

A color-coded map in the report shows where countries stand in terms of general progress on the goal based on several academic papers from the past few years, including from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Countries that have achieved the five targets of SDG 13 are in green, while those farthest behind are in red.

This map shows progress made towards SDG 13. Countries in green have achieved the SDG. Yellow indicates that challenges remain; orange that significant challenges remain; red that major challenges remain; grey that information is unavailable.

Of the top 10 greenhouse gas emitters in the world, which account for nearly 70% of global emissions, only India is in green. China, the largest emitter in the world, has improved on climate action in recent years, but faces challenges that currently make achieving the goal by 2030 unlikely, including an overreliance on coal, a relentless construction industry, and growing energy demands.

The US, the second largest emitter, has regressed on goal 13 in recent years and is nowhere near achieving the targets. In recent years, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, scrapped plans to improve the gas mileage of cars, unraveled a plan to increase the efficiency of power plants, and has made it easier for companies to drill for fossil fuels.

Countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Vietnam, and Pakistan have all reached the targets of goal 13. In the case of Ethiopia, the government is working to reduce agricultural emissions, promote forest growth, invest in renewable energy, and implement energy efficiency throughout industries.

What this means in terms of achieving the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, isn’t discussed at length in the report. The SDGs do not include concrete emissions reductions or temperature increase targets.

As a result, critics have argued that the SDGs fail to meaningfully address climate change and that even if they’re achieved, the global environment will continue to deteriorate and emissions will remain at catastrophic levels.

The Climate Action Tracker, which assesses how the emissions reductions of countries relate to a warming climate, found that only Morocco has developed a plan compatible with the Paris climate agreement. Only two countries — India and Ethiopia — have plans compatible with staying under a 2 degrees Celsius rise.

Because leading polluters have failed to take climate change seriously, the world is far from achieving SDG 13 by 2030, and will likely blow past the Paris climate agreement goal of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unless dramatic interventions are made, then the world could pass the 1.5 degree Celsius mark in the next four years and temperatures could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which would usher in apocalyptic consequences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in global emissions, but analysts forecast that emissions will bounce back in the years ahead because emissions had been steadily rising in recent years, despite record levels of investment in renewable energy.

The fact that renewable energy is booming around the world, yet emissions continue to rise, shows how growth-oriented economies undermine climate action.

For emissions to decline at levels required by the Paris agreement, countries would have to overhaul their entire economies. In the aftermath of the pandemic, countries have the opportunity to embark on green economic recoveries that scale down carbon-intensive and environmentally harmful industries like fossil fuel production.

Projects such as the Great Green Wall in Africa — which seeks to regenerate landscapes across the Sahel and create community-based economic development — are a powerful model for the years ahead.

The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.

The SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), also published its third series of policy briefs on SDG 7 and its interlinkages with other SDGs in support of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

‘Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report,’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), monitors and assesses the world’s progress towards global targets for universal access to sustainable, affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It also identifies best practices, policies, measures, and scenarios to accelerate further progress and simultaneously pursue other SDGs.

On universal access (SDG target 7.1: “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services,” including access to electricity (indicator 7.1.1) and access to clean cooking solutions (indicator 7.1.2)), the report finds that over 1 billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, increasing the connected proportion of the population from 83% to 90%. However, 789 million people still do not have access to electricity, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 70% of this deficit. The report estimates that by 2030, 620 million people will lack electricity access, 85% of them in Africa. The report recommends that governments respond to the COVD-19 crisis by working with donors and investors to ensure that off-grid developers, utilities, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain active and that governments adopt a suite of safeguards to protect energy consumers.

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report. While the global proportion of the population with access increased by 200 million between 2010 and 2018, 2.7 billion people remained without access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of those without access increased from 750 million to 890 million. The report concludes that 2.3 billion people, 30% of the world’s population, will continue to lack clean cooking fuels by 2030. It recommends that governments utilize more comprehensive household surveys to support more effective evidence-based policy and investment decisions.

On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption. This increase was driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy in the power sector. The report finds that while adoption of renewable energy in the heating and transport sector lags behind its potential, it will be required to achieve SDG 7.2 by 2030.

On energy efficiency (SDG target 7.3: “By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”), the report states that in recent years, the rates of improvement in global primary energy intensity have fallen to 1.7%, although the average rate of improvement between 2010-2017 was 2.2%. To achieve the SDG 7.3 energy efficiency target of doubling the historic improvement rate, annual improvement will need to increase to an average of 3% per year between 2017-2030. The report recommends that countries make energy efficiency a policy and investment priority through minimum energy efficiency standards, market-based mechanisms, financial incentives, and other means.

On international public finance (SDG target 7.a: “By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology,” with indicator 7.a.1 focusing on international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy), the report finds that while total international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy doubled to USD 21.4 billion in 2017 over 2010 flows, only 12% reached least developed countries (LDCs), which are the furthest from achieving SDG 7 targets.

This country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

States presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations in a two week-long conference which included a high-level political forum on sustainable development and a three-day ministerial meeting held under the UN Economic and Social Council. The theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Beckles in her presentation of TTs first VNRs noted that it was centred around eight of the 17 SDGs and they were incorporated into TT’s national development strategy and vision 2030. The eight SDGs are good health care (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).

She explained that TT’s plan focused on putting people first by nurturing asset; delivering good governance and service excellence; improving productivity through quality infrastructure and transportation; building globally competitive businesses and placing the environment at the centre of social and economic development.

Beckles said, “Our commitment to “Leaving No-One Behind” has been anchored in the strengthening of the country's public policy framework through vision 2030 and the implementation of several policy initiatives directly related to SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5 and SDG 10.”

She noted that while TT and the world suffered tremendous losses due to covid19, this country minimised economic contraction through adjustments, reforms, and private sector support.

“Government has taken a multi-dimensional approach, with the introduction of a number of financial and economic measures to minimise contraction of the economy and maintain economic activity.

“This was in conjunction with the creation of a 'Road to Recovery' committee which comprised representatives from government, private sector, civil society, labour and academia, which was established to develop a plan for the reopening of society and the road to economic recovery for the post-pandemic period,” Beckles said.

She highlighted the progress within the health system through improved statistics in mortality rates with the Perinatal Information System which improves evidenced-based clinical decision-making for mothers and their new-born babies.

Beckles noted that, “The system contributed to the annual decline in the maternal mortality rate between 2015, from 42.9 per 100,000 live births to 12.3 per 100,000 live births, in 2018.

“Our nation's health sector also recorded a decline in the under-five mortality rates from 13.9 per 1,000 live births in 2016 to 11.3 per 1,000 live births in 2018.”

Beckles further noted TT’s moves to provide education for all with the increase of in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centers (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) through the increased participation of women in politics and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).

“The increase of the national minimum wage from $15 per hour, to $17.50 per hour, was in part aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable. These measures are further supported by a robust legal and policy framework which includes child protection and Gender -Based Violence units in our police service, she said.

Climate change, a big concern for small island developing states (SIDS) was of key importance to TT, Beckles pointed out and its contribution has been continued reduction in overall cumulative emissions from the electricity generation, industry, and transportation sectors.

Beckles added that TT continued to strive for strong institutions with the collaboration of government, law enforcement, academia, and civil societies among others for its effectiveness, but there remained challenges.

She said, “Undoubtedly, TT has made commendable strides. We are more cognisant of the challenges that could hinder our realisation of the 2030 Agenda. Climate change, citizen insecurity, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and the uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic can all undermine our development ambitions.”","Beckles present TT’s SDG goals progress to UNFile photo: Pennelope BecklesThis country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

196,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/mangroves-a-unique-ally-in-the-climate-emergency/,"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Mangroves: A Unique Ally in the Climate Emergency,"Nearly 20 years have passed since the first time I stepped into a mangrove forest, yet the memory is still among my fondest memories. I was already captivated by mangrove ecology through my studies; but it was only when my boots first disappeared under the mud that I was truly hooked. I arrived at Ko Phra Thong in Thailand to take part in a survey of the mangroves on the island and I was so keen to get started that I didn’t even stop to change from shorts to long trousers, or to slap on some mosquito repellent. Well, they had a feast on my legs, leaving some very physical, itchy reminders of the experience, to add to the romantic charm of the soft green dappled light and salty breeze.

Mangrove forests are unique ecosystems, straddling the boundary between ocean and land. Their significant roles in securing a habitat for a wide range of unique species of fish, insects, mollusks and plants, and in providing direct and indirect livelihood benefits for coastal communities are all well studied. The COVID-19 outbreak and the related impacts on countries and communities put increasing visibility and recognition of the importance of the availability and sustainability of such food security and livelihoods benefits.

More recently, attention has turned to the importance of mangroves as sinks of greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide and methane – and hence their critical role in mitigating climate change. Moreover, intact and healthy mangroves act as a natural buffer, contributing to the reduction of impact forces and depth and velocity of natural hazards, thus contributing to coastal communities’ ability to adapt as the frequency and severity of such events increases as a result of climate change.

The prominence of mangroves in international dialogues and national efforts on ‘nature-based solutions’ is therefore becoming more evident, as we set out to harness the unique qualities of mangroves towards both the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.

Foremost among these efforts is the inclusion of mangroves in national REDD+ strategies, through which developing countries aim to incorporate the forest sector into their policies and approaches to tackling climate change, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Preparation of national REDD+ strategies involves the identification of specific policies and actions to address, and where possible to reverse, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and to increase forest cover. In so doing, several countries, including Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Myanmar, recognized the value of mangroves-based mitigation actions. Furthermore, at least 45 countries around the world specifically mentioned mangroves in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards fulfilling the global goals of the Paris Agreement.

When countries introduce practical, cost-effective and achievable policies and actions for the management and protection of forests, while providing sustainable development opportunities for local forest communities, the rate of forest loss can be reduced, as well as the net emissions of greenhouse gases from forest areas.

Countries that achieve emission reductions from deforestation and fulfill UNFCCC REDD+ Warsaw framework are eligible for results-based payments, for example through the Green Climate Fund RBP pilot programme, bilateral agreements with donors, or other mechanisms. In this regard, reduction of mangroves deforestation, as a high carbon-rich ecosystem, can be a strategic ally to achieve results of magnitude.

FAO, also through and with the flagship UN-REDD Programme (a collaborative effort between FAO, UNDP and UNEP), is working with countries to integrate mangroves into their REDD+ strategies and implement specific actions. Entry points include changes to practices in communities involved in shrimp farming or charcoal production, and support to governments in defining comprehensive packages of policies and measures for mangrove ecosystems and the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods. While planning their REDD+ activities, countries may want to carry out assessments and develop studies on the impacts and benefits of mangroves on the wider landscape and rural economy, so that the results could be presented to relevant line ministries, development partners and initiatives. They may also request support in developing specific emission factors and allometric equations for mangroves, and share these with other countries. This will allow for much more accurate estimations of the potential and actual contribution of mangrove-based actions, policies and measures to REDD+ strategy objectives.

Despite all the recognition mentioned so far, mangroves continue to be subject to pressures such as expansion of commercial agriculture and aquaculture. Their depletion is a cause of serious environmental and economic concern to many developing countries.

During the week of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, it is key to remember the importance of protecting, sustainably managing and restoring this key ecosystem, and the opportunities this represent for countries and local communities, as a key ally for food security, sustainable livelihood, and in the fight against climate change.

Keeping the world’s mangroves healthy will require a combination of integrated coastal management, inter-sectoral coordinated rural development policy, and the sharing of technical expertise and effective practices within and between countries. These efforts will be in vain unless they are combined with approaches to improve the livelihoods and capacities of the people whose actions most directly affect mangroves, such as rural farming and fishing communities.

The inclusion of mangroves management, conservation and restoration in REDD+ strategies and in NDCs represent opportunities to boost moving towards healthy and sustainable ecosystems. In addition, the upcoming UN Decade on ecosystem restoration represents another important vector for actions on the ground. Countries demonstrated interest in mangrove restoration, with approximate thirty countries mentioning mangroves in their restoration pledges as part of the Bonn Challenge.

197,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/covid-19-what-happens-when-summer-heatwaves-strike/,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: COVID-19: What Happens When Summer Heatwaves Strike?,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak started in the middle of winter in the Northern hemisphere, it has become clear that it is to stay with us throughout and beyond the summer. The past few summers were among the hottest ever recorded, and forecasts have similar predictions for 2020: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has put out a warning that this summer will likely see temperature extremes once again. With heatwaves becoming more extreme and lasting longer, they increasingly affect human health.

For example, in Germany alone, the heatwave of 2003 resulted in nearly 7,000 deaths and many heat-related illnesses such as heat strokes, dehydration, and cardiovascular diseases. Many of these have to be treated in hospitals and will therefore put an additional strain on the capacities of the healthcare system.

Heatwaves are particularly problematic for urban citizens because densely built-up urban areas are especially prone to the so-called “heat island effect.” This effect occurs because when buildings are close together, they heat up one another. This is why urban areas are often up to 3°C warmer than their rural surroundings. Additionally, temperatures hardly drop overnight anymore due to a lack of ventilation and thermal absorption of houses and surfaces. This leads to “tropical” nights when temperatures do not drop below 20°C, adding to the residents’ health stress.

When heatwaves strike, people in cities tend to flock to green open spaces like parks or to bodies of water because these have a cooling effect. However, this behavior leads to exactly the kind of overcrowding which is not compatible with physical distancing. In the past, many European cities took innovative precaution measures to allow people to cool down. They extended the opening hours of public pools or air-conditioned public spaces like town halls or shopping centers, for example. However this year, we will be facing a complete closure of these facilities or at least restricted hours of operation.

If the predictions are true and this summer proves to be extraordinarily hot, more people than ever before will be working from heated-up homes (most European countries do not have air conditioning in private residences) instead of air-conditioned office buildings. Their options to take weekend trips to the countryside will also be more limited than usual. Even taking a longer summer vacation to flee hot cities for a couple of weeks will be more difficult to realize.

Yet, if urban citizens are left without options to cool down, it will put an additional burden on healthcare systems as people suffer from heat-related symptoms. The heat will also take a toll on their mental health when, in addition to contact bans and restrictions, they have to deal with the discomfort caused by heat that they can hardly escape.

It is crucial to develop concrete ideas for how the urban population can safely navigate the summer.

Those cities that have already invested in large-scale green or blue infrastructure such as green open spaces and ponds will have an advantage. Such multifunctional spaces are not only cooler during heatwaves, but they also protect from natural hazard impacts like heavy rainfalls or flooding, which makes them a worthwhile investment beyond the pandemic. If they are designed in a grid with pocket parks and community gardens, the risk of overcrowded green areas and temporary closures decreases. We need to work out how to best utilize these existing spaces so that a large number of people can cool down safely.

While it may not be possible to build a park in time for a heatwave, it is not too late to create multifunctional spaces with mobile shading elements and some vegetation in crowded neighborhoods. Parking areas or empty lots, for example, have great potential for quick and highly effective conversion. Schoolyards could also be opened up for the public. In addition, we need space for cyclists and pedestrians where they can safely move around with enough distance between them. Many cities are addressing these challenges. Brussels, for example, has just introduced a new traffic concept for its inner city, and Munich has introduced pop-up trails.

There are also measures that individuals can take, which can be encouraged. Green roofs and walls contribute to cooling homes, for example. Now is the time to think about greening houses or retrofitting them, for instance by adding sunshades or vegetation to provide shade. Another measure is to enhance thermal insulation and ventilation systems of residential buildings.

Which measures work best where has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. People’s living arrangements are different and so are their challenges, which calls for different solutions. Those of us who live in small apartments without balconies or gardens and whose apartments heat up quickly will be more challenged than those living in large homes with big outdoor spaces. These kinds of social dimensions have to be taken into account.

At the same time, we have to keep in mind that while this pandemic is hopefully a temporary challenge, another more long-term pressing challenge, climate change, must not be neglected in our efforts. While houses and apartments can be cooled down with air conditioning units, experts consider them a form of “maladaptation.” Firstly, air conditioning units use a large amount of energy, which is harmful to the environment, and secondly, they give off heat to the surrounding area, which then gets even hotter.

The long-term goal for livable cities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) must be green-blue infrastructure, which not only benefits climate change adaptation and mitigation (SDG 13) but also gives us space for leisure and recreation, and ultimately contributes to human health and well-being (SDG 3). At the same time, it can contribute to multiple goals of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) as well as targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), including “build back better” as the guiding principle in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (Priority Area 4).

Finally, there are also some promising societal developments that we have seen with COVID-19. Over the past weeks, numerous community initiatives to support the elderly and other vulnerable groups have been initiated in many cities, including activities that bring together previously often unknown neighbors. Younger neighbors go shopping for older neighbors so that they do not expose themselves to the increased risks of contracting COVID-19, for example. Also in other crises, some societal groups tend to be more vulnerable than others. Less vulnerable groups supporting more vulnerable ones is a mechanism that has been proven highly successful in times of crisis, including during heatwaves, making it possible to spare the elderly from having to go to the supermarket on particularly hot days.

It is certain that COVID-19 will profoundly change how we experience summer, but it is not too late to prepare so that we can still enjoy the warmer temperatures.

Today we are facing an implausible pandemic that has affected the lives of the entire population. The economy is slowing, if not stagnating; it is like an invisible hand suddenly pressing the pause button.

The pandemic has also put the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) global agenda in jeopardy. Even before COVID-19 struck, many had cast doubt over whether all the goals would be achieved in 2030 as targeted when the SDGs were launched during the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015.

Economics professor William Esterly from New York University quipped that SDGs could be abbreviated to ""senseless, dreamy, garbled"". In one of its reports, The Economist describes SDGs as ""sprawling and misconceived, […] unfeasibly expensive"" costing US$2 trillion to $3 trillion per year and are impossible to realize. In fact, many say the SDGs are utopian and ambitious.

A year before the pandemic, the lack of global commitment to SDGs was beginning to be felt, particularly in terms of advocacy and media communication. A World Bank study (2019) showed that 31 percent of its ""knowledge products"", which include recommendations for the SDG action plan, had never been downloaded and 87 percent had never been cited.

In a 2018 report titled ""How the Indonesian Media Deals With SDGs"", University of Indonesia (UI) lecturer Irwansyah claims that not all SDGs are understood by the local media and only a few are framed based on public policy concerns. He concludes that the Indonesian media is not well informed about SDGs and the goals are not considered an interesting news topic.

Today, the media is more interested in political issues, especially in the time of COVID-19. SDGs have disappeared from the news, overshadowed by coronavirus headlines.

Looking at the performance of Asia-Pacific countries over the last five years, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) reported that in line with the current trajectory, the region will not achieve any of the 17 SDGs by 2030. Progress exists but at a sluggish pace, with efforts to meet over a half of the goals stagnating or even moving to the opposite direction.

In Indonesia, not all provinces have regional action plans to meet SDGs, let alone include them in their middle and long-term development plan. At the national level, some targets have not even been determined.

Based on monitoring conducted by the SDGs Center of Padjadjaran University, progress had been made up 2018 in achieving SDG target indicators. The SDG target score increased in 28 out of 34 provinces that year.

The arrival of COVID-19 has surely slowed down the country’s bid to meet its SDG targets. Almost all goals will be directly or indirectly affected, given that each goal does not stand alone but is interconnected with another. The UN SDGs report 2020 stated that now due to COVID -19 crisis, efforts to achieve the coals are even more challenging.

COVID-19 is impacting health, the economy, education, poverty alleviation, gender equality, the environment, climate change and other issues to be addressed under the SDG agenda. A quick simulation by Andi Sumner et al. (2020) in 138 developing countries and 26 developed countries shows that even in a moderate scenario, COVID-19 has added a poor population of 85 million people. While SMERU Research Institute found about 8.5 million Indonesians would plunge into poverty due to the pandemic.

The delay in achieving SDGs is unavoidable as states have reallocated their budgets to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. A study by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNDESA) shows there has been a change in the quality of the environment amid COVID-19, but it may not last long as large-scale recovery measures post-pandemic may warm the planet again.

The role of nonstate actors such as the private sector is difficult to predict, given that the pandemic has severely affected businesses.

The pandemic, however, is not an excuse to stop efforts to achieve SDG targets by 2030. COVID-19 is instead offering opportunities for us to do more to fulfill the goals. For one, the health crisis has taught us how to live a healthy life, to care for and share with others — the renewed mindset we need the most to achieve SDG targets.

The pandemic has also proven that everybody is equal. COVID-19 affects the young and old, poor and rich, men and women; the pandemic has put us all on the same boat.

Other blessings in disguise of this pandemic are the rise of global cooperation and strengthening of science-based decision-making, both of which provide an ideal opportunity for states to achieve their SDG targets.

The question is: How can we maintain this momentum? First, it is important for all actors to improve the communication strategy of SDGs and step up their campaigns. Second, there is a need to reset national and regional SDG targets for all indicators. Third, identify the right policies and suggestions needed to achieve the SDGs. This will require the government to determine the level of urgency, with priority given to the low-hanging fruit. Fourth, renew political will and commitment.

Fifth, develop knowledge, capacity and innovation to implement SDGs. Sixth, seek more funding sources for SDGs through partnerships, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility and synchronization of a national SDGs financing hub and the SDG Indonesia One platform.

Shared understanding of Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs)

The SDI AOP allows asset owners and their managers to connect around the shared objective of measuring and understanding their portfolio investments' contributions to the SDGs. These goals, set by the United Nations in 2015, aim for a better, more prosperous world, by addressing urgent global issues such as water scarcity, healthcare access, and protecting the environment. Investments in companies whose products or services contribute to the realization of the SDGs are called Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs).

AI-driven actionable insights

The SDI Asset Owner Platform provides a common definition, taxonomy, and data source for investments into the SDGs. Powered by AI-technology, data science company Entis generates SDI classifications for 8,000 companies to date. This enables investors to assess their global capital markets' portfolios on their contribution to the SDGs and to report to their clients and external stakeholders transparently and consistently, using a common and auditable standard. The SDI classifications will be commercially available through Qontigo. The SDI definition and taxonomy are public and equally applicable to private market investments.

Asset-owner led platform

The SDI AOP is asset owner-led and asset owners make all methodological choices. The platform builds on the direct input and feedback from asset owners and their managers, and feeds the participating asset owners' policy and investment needs into the assessment process. Subscribers and other stakeholders will also be invited to provide feedback. The SDI Asset Owner Platform will host a virtual event in September to provide interested investors with additional insight into the workings of the platform.

Commitment to the SDGs

The participating asset owners believe it is essential to invest into the SDGs, and to do so at scale. In September 2019, APG and PGGM, at the behest of their pension fund clients ABP, bpfBOUW and PFZW, announced their cooperation to set up the SDI Asset Owner Platform. These pension funds, among them the two largest in the Netherlands, have set ambitious targets for investing in the SDGs. AustralianSuper and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) have since joined the platform. The SDI AOP welcomes investors across the globe to subscribe, creating a critical mass of investors who together define the meaning of investing in the SDGs.

Claudia Kruse, Managing Director Global Responsible Investment & Governance, APG

""The SDGs are global and launching this standard with asset owners from three continents shows our commitment to contribute to the SDGs, and we look forward to extending the collaboration. SDGs and AI-based technology are at the forefront of innovation. This investment is part of our commitment to our clients on whose behalf we invest in order to provide affordable pension in a sustainable world.""

Andrew Gray, Director ESG and Stewardship, AustralianSuper

""As a founding member of the SDI AOP, AustralianSuper strongly welcomes the opportunity to jointly establish a global standard for investors to identify sustainable development investments. The platform will progress how we assess and engage with investee companies on their SDG contribution, measurement and reporting. This will promote real world sustainable outcomes which are vital for creating long-term value for beneficiaries.""

Jennifer Coulson, Vice President ESG, BCI

""Standardization of data is one of the biggest challenges facing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) landscape. For this reason, we are excited to be part of this asset-owner led initiative which sets a global standard on SDG contributions for all investors and brings consistency and comparability to company-level data. This is the type of quality data that BCI relies on when making investment decisions that are required to generate value-added returns for our clients.""

Eloy Lindeijer, Chief Investment Management, PGGM

""For PGGM this platform is an important next step in a process to mobilize ever more institutional capital around the big challenges of our time, as described in the SDGs. By collaborating with asset owners from different continents we hope that this SDI AOP will contribute to being a global standard for investors.''

Sebastian Ceria, Chief Executive Officer, Qontigo

""The application of transparent rules-based methodologies, common definitions, taxonomies and strong data are the bedrock elements required for effective sustainable investing. We are proud to be a part of the SDI Asset Owner Platform's efforts to enhance the ability of investors to achieve their commendable goals in sustainable investing.""

Wim Scheper, Managing Director, Entis

""Contributing to the development of a global standard for SDG investments is truly inspiring. It will guide the decision-making by investors and companies towards a more sustainable world.""

Rabat – Morocco is among 47 countries to carry out a 2020 Voluntary National Review regarding the country’s progress toward the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030.

Over the course of three days, beginning on July 14 and ending on July 16, Morocco participated in this year’s annual SDG meeting. The 2020 theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans residing abroad Nezha El Ouafi spoke at the virtual UN High Level Political Forum meeting on July 16. She explained the Voluntary National Review has enabled the country to measure its progress as it continuously works toward Morocco’s development goals.

Efforts to improve the prosperity of the country’s population include a new project to overhaul and renew the Moroccan development model.

The minister delegate added that King Mohamed VI is setting up a national commission responsible for updating the development model. The model will assess challenges inhibiting the country’s growth in education and training, employment, social protection, and youth issues.

Morocco’s development efforts involve implementing institutional reforms amid the consolidation of its development model. They also include advancing protection and assistance programs for women, children, and people with disabilities. Setting up a National Charter for the Environment and Sustainable Development also features in the strategy.

The country is also establishing global partnerships, particularly in Africa, that fulfill its commitment to achieving Agenda 2030 on an international scale.

Morocco’s notable efforts toward the Sustainable Development Goals

According to the UN Sustainable Development Goals website, Morocco has made significant investments and efforts toward the country’s successful development. The North African country began its own national development efforts in 2000. It mobilized a third of its GDP to fight poverty, social inequality, and climate change while enhancing its natural resources.

“These efforts have enabled the country to strengthen its accumulation of physical capital, promote its human capital, [and] accelerate its transition to clean development,” reads the online report.

Thus, improving “the content of its economic growth in terms of employment, poverty reduction, social and territorial inequalities and reduction of dependence on fossil fuels, and this in a context marked by the international financial crisis of 2008 and three years of drought in the last decade,” read the online report.

The UN SDG website noted Morocco’s 4.2% economic growth from 2000-2018, a 9% drop in unemployment, and decreased levels of poverty. It also commended the country’s reduction in inequality across regions, investment in renewable energies, and urban development initiatives. Advancement of hydraulic sanitation projects and extensions of forest space also earned a mention.

This is Morocco’s second Voluntary National Review since King Mohamed VI’s administration adopted the SDGs in 2015. A year later, Morocco conducted its first review.

What are the Sustainable Development Goals?

World leaders have adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals under the United Nations 2030 Agenda in order to address development issues. The goals are a blueprint for a more peaceful, prosperous future for all of humanity, “leaving no one behind.”

Countries involved have agreed to work toward goals at the levels of biosphere, society, economy, and partnership. Society goals include no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and affordable and clean energy. Sustainable cities and communities also fall in this category, as well as peace, justice, and strong institutions.

Biosphere goals include climate action, clean water and sanitation, life below water, and life on land. Economy goals include decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, sustainable consumption and production, and industry, innovation and infrastructure. Partnerships to achieve the goals span all levels.","Morocco conducted its second Voluntary National Review of its progress toward the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

The “new special topic” for the issue is market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies.

The report titled, ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020,’ compiles the main tariff parameters for each of the 164 WTO members, as well as other countries and customs territories where data are available. Each one-page tariff profile contains information on tariffs imposed by each economy on its imports, with disaggregation by sectors and duty ranges, and includes an analysis of the market access conditions each economy faces in its major export markets.

The publication features summary tariff and trade statistics for all countries and territories for all products, including a breakdown into agricultural and non-agricultural products, and information on non-tariff measures such as safeguards and anti-dumping measures, which, the report notes, “are of increasing importance in international trade.” Statistics for all countries and territories are presented in standardized tables, which, the report states, allows for easy comparisons between economies, between sectors, and, specifically for WTO members, between bound and applied tariffs.

The “special topic,” which presents a new subject in each edition, deals with market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies. The report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic “has highlighted the importance of easy access to affordable medical products” and that shortages of essential products and increased prices “have made it all the more challenging for countries to combat the crisis.” The relevant chapter discusses the bound and applied tariffs for medical products such as medicines and medical technology, critical for the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, the average tariff applied by WTO members to all medical products is 4.8%, with the highest tariffs (11.5% on average) being applied to personal protective products.

MONTREAL, Canada, Jul 6 2020 (IPS) - As the nations of the world prepare to gather virtually to assess progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), society is just beginning to imagine what a post-COVID world might be like.



While many uncertainties remain, one thing is clear, the lives of people and the transactions of our economy and government will move more and more online. In 2015, 193 nations committed to the SDGs, which set out a transformative agenda that linked human health and prosperity to environmental health and equity.

This holistic agenda is critical. But the current crisis highlights that it is incomplete. The SDGs failed to address the governance of one of the most powerful forces defining humanity’s future: the digital age.

The digital age is disrupting social systems and driving transformations at a scale and pace unparalleled in history. Decades ago, philosopher and media theorist Marshall McLuhan inspired the aphorism “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.”

Indeed, today digital technologies are shaping what we read and consume, our votes, and how we interact with each other and the world around us. Many risks and uncertainties are emerging, including threats to individual rights, social equity, and democracy, all amplified by ‘the digital divide’ – the differential rate of internet penetration and access to digital technologies around the world.

Along with the great risks of harm comes massive opportunities to leverage the capabilities of the digital age to steer society towards our common goals as expressed through the SDGs, including net-zero carbon emissions and a more equitable global society. In the digital age, power can be decentralized from the top to stakeholders, social norms of consumption can be shifted towards low carbon products, and society’s mindset shifted from fossil fuels to renewables.

We need a new SDG — SDG18 — focused on the digital age, which outlines clear targets for leveraging this transformative force to benefit both people and the planet.

Sustainability in the Digital Age

The United Nations recently released a roadmap for enhancing global digital coordination in support of humanity. This sets out a much needed framework to begin to address the digital governance gap and lays a base to effectively leverage the digital sector to tackle the climate crisis and broader sustainability goals.

In parallel, a collective statement has just been issued by leaders from business, government, civil society, and researchers: The Montreal Statement on Sustainability in the Digital Age. This Statement calls on society to recognize that tackling the climate crisis, building a sustainable world, and working toward a just and equitable digital future are inherently interconnected agendas. It lays the foundation for what could define an action agenda for the missing SDG 18.

The statement outlines five near-term actions to overcome profound risks of the digital age and leverage its transformative capabilities to build a climate-safe, sustainable, and equitable world.

These include the need to:

●Build a new social contract for the digital age, which addresses individual rights, justice and equity, inclusive access, and environmental sustainability;

●Ensure open and transparent access to data and knowledge critical to achieving sustainability and equity;

●Foster public and private collaborations to develop and manage AI and other technologies in support of sustainability and equity;

●Promote research and innovation to steer digital transformations toward sustainability and equity; and

●Support targeted communication, engagement and education to advance the social contract.

The statement was first formulated during an international workshop in Montreal last September as part of the CIFAR AI & Society series. It was subsequently shared, reviewed, and revised by others worldwide working in the digital and sustainability sectors.

Statement collaborators will also be gathering during the UN High-Level Political Forum in July, to explore collaborative action for digital capacity-building to implement the UN’s 2030 SDG Agenda.

Motivating all this work is a realization that the initial aspirations of the digital revolution – democratization of information, the strengthening of governance through broader citizen engagement, a more equitable and greener sharing economy – were never fulfilled because we, as a society, failed to anticipate how the digital revolution would unfold.

We did not foresee the scale of changes that would result from the new business models, governance systems, and communications systems, nor the new types of societal challenges posed by such large-scale change.

As a result, we now live in a digital age that threatens individual rights, has facilitated the propagation of disinformation, undermines trust, and can ultimately threaten democracy.

We are in a moment of unprecedented disruption, which opens up opportunities for transformative change. Among the most powerful forces defining our future are those of the digital age. We must put this force to work for people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships.

SDG target 17.11 is one of 21 targets with a “2020” deadline (Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ (LDCs) share of global exports by 2020). Likewise, SDG target 14.6 calls for, by 2020, prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, while those subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing are to be eliminated entirely. After nearly 20 years, World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations were closing in on concluding talks on this issue. The WTO Ministerial Conference was set to convene in June 2020, with many eyeing the event as an opportunity to address these and other pressing trade issues, some of which have languished for years.

Instead, the year 2020 will be recalled for very different reasons for the global trade regime. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, including international trade flows. News about trade policy during the last few months has, in many ways, provided a barometer on the unfolding, multi-pronged crisis. As borders closed to stem the human-to-human spread of the virus, implications for trade in essential medical supplies were quickly singled out as priorities for exceptions. The need for continued trade in essential supplies also brought the inequalities that the pandemic exposed into focus. Moreover, the need for collective action to ensure intellectual property rules (IPRs) do not create a hindrance to the crisis response has also been raised in the context of the World Health Organization, where the final COVID-19 resolution includes language referring to the use of previously agreed flexibilities in the WTO’s IPR rules. The growing number of export restrictions on agricultural goods has raised concerns over whether a repeat of past food price crises and a rise in global hunger levels and food insecurity may be on the horizon.

While there were acknowledgements that the extraordinary circumstances justified breaching global agreements or taking advantage of their existing flexibilities, there have also been calls to ensure that multilateral approaches resume as soon as possible, along with reminders that multilateralism will be essential to efforts to build back better.

Furthermore, leadership changes have added to the uncertainties that the pandemic has wrought, while also focusing attention on what is needed to emerge stronger from the pandemic. The May 2020 announcement by World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo of his surprise decision to step down launched a “politically charged” selection process for the next Director-General, despite having a full year remaining in his second term. His successor’s task will be to help the multilateral trading system respond to new economic realities caused by COVID-19.

The SDG Knowledge Hub is publishing news about these and more trade-related policy developments, thanks to support from the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). The summary below offers a brief overview of the news during the last two months. We encourage you to visit our “Trade” coverage webpage often. IISD is also establishing a peer-to-peer community list to further foster the information flow on trade and sustainable development policy. Sign up for the Trade and SD News group here.

COVID-19 Puts Development Gains at Risk

As projections of the extent of the damage caused by the global pandemic are revised downward, there are growing concerns about sustainable recovery and resilience of the global economic system to future crises.

Already back in April, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a new debt crisis, and recommended actions to build back better for sustainable development, including the elimination of trade barriers and restrictions that affect supply chains. In a Communiqué following its virtual meeting on 17 April, the World Bank Development Committee recognized the pandemic’s “exceptional negative shock” on the global economy and disruptions to trade, supply chains, and investment flows, warning about its potential to “erase development gains for many countries.”

The same month, the WTO forecast that world trade would fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the pandemic. A May 2020 report by the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that COVID-19 had cut global trade values by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, projecting the decline to accelerate, with an expected 27% quarter-on-quarter decline.

The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2020 found that the coronavirus pandemic had caused a “steep drop” in investment flows, hitting developing countries the hardest. During an informal briefing among UN system leaders to discuss building on the UN’s operational framework for social and economic responses to the pandemic, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Mona Juul cited “incomprehensible setbacks to our hard-won development goals” due to COVID-19.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report warned that LDCs, land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, insufficient social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade. Among trade-related impacts in LDCs, a WTO information note highlighted a “significant decline in export earnings” among these countries since the outbreak of COVID-19, which may affect their graduation prospects.

Overcoming the Pandemic

As the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has suggested, the pace of post-COVID-19 recovery will depend on the length of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of policy responses. Over the past months, world leaders, UN agencies, and relevant stakeholders have engaged on various levels to address the crisis and chart the path towards global recovery.

Some of the actions, many of which were spearheaded by the WTO or groups of WTO Members, included:

The Ottawa Group, comprised of 13 WTO Members and devoted to developing options for reforming the organization, outlined six action areasto focus on in light of COVID-19: transparency and withdrawal of trade-restrictive measures; keeping open and predictable trade in agricultural and agrifood products; e-commerce; trade facilitation through the use of information technology and streamlined procedures; an initiative on medical supplies; and deepening engagement with stakeholders.

During the 1 July meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Services, many WTO Members highlighted the importance of sharing experiences, including on trade facilitating measures adopted to address the crisis and promote economic recovery.

The WTO and six multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint statementhighlighting measures taken to step up trade finance programmes to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WTO’s ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020’ report featured market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies as the “special topic.”

The WTO’s 23rd biannual monitoring reporton trade measures, covering the period from mid-October 2019 to mid-May 2020, found that Group of 20 (G20) economies implemented 154 new trade or trade-related measures over the time period, of which 60% were linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several G20 ministerialsconvened in April, many of which were special meetings devoted to the pandemic. Ministers highlighted efforts to promote international trade cooperation while minimizing impacts of COVID-19 though “a coordinated global response.”

A UNCTAD reportoutlined ways to facilitate trade in areas related to process optimization, cost reduction, transparency and cooperation enhancement, and full use of technology to ensure cross-border trade continues while reducing face-to-face interaction.

Another UNCTAD reportdiscussed how South-South cooperation can help build solidarity to weather the interconnected economic and public health crises.

UNCTAD and the five UN regional commissions launched a projectto help governments and businesses keep transport networks and borders operational and facilitate the flow of goods and services, while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.

The International Trade Centre (ITC) released a 15-point action planto support micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Representatives from the UN and its Member States considered actionsto mitigate the potential socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on food availability and supply, and to attain food security.

A webinarconvened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s (IISD) Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) addressed trade and climate change in the context of COVID-19, showcasing examples of national responses and policies being implemented.

A webinar convened by IISD addressed the interlinkages between trade, public health, and intellectual property rights, especially given the COVID-19 resolution negotiated and adopted for the 73rd World Health Assembly.

Engagement with China included an EU-China summit on 22 June where European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, drew attention to “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between China and the EU.

Selection Process for Next WTO Director-General

Amid efforts to bring about the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he will step down on 31 August 2020, cutting his second term short by one year. The selection process for the next Director-General normally spans six months, but following a 10 July announcement by WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), the process has been shortened, with the third and final phase now scheduled to begin on 7 September.

Eight WTO Members (Egypt, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the UK) submitted nominations for the post of WTO Director-General to succeed Azevêdo. Following the closure of the nomination period on 8 July, candidates are meeting with WTO members at a special General Council meeting from 15-17 July to present their views and take questions from the membership. They will then have the remainder of July and all of August to continue making their case for the role.

The UN has warned in its recently released State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 report that achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger might not be possible by 2030. The report estimates 690 million people suffering from hunger globally in 2019, 10 million more than the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic, and the global recession caused by it, will without doubt make matters worse, the report warns, with 130 million more suffering from chronic hunger in 2020. In 2019, Asia had the highest number of hungry people (381 million), followed by Africa (250 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030. The lowest-cost healthy diet is estimated to cost, on an average, more than $1.90—which is more than the international poverty threshold—and around three billion people across the globe are unable to afford this. Rising food deprivation will exacerbate the existing problem of nutrition security.

The largest impact, both for the present as well as the future, will be of hunger amongst children—191 million children under the age of five are currently undernourished. While India saw under-5 undernutrition decline by around 60 million over the last one and a half decade, from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19, and stunting has also come down, experts fear the pandemic could erode some of this progress. The UN has pitched for clubbing direct cash transfers with in-kind transfers to ensure food security and diet diversity, though, in India’s case, it talks of the inefficiencies of the PDS and calls for reducing subsidies and redirecting these to direct cash transfer. Malnutrition, as estimated by FAO earlier, may cost nations 4-5% of their GDPs. Given how ensuring food security gets more urgent in the post-Covid-19 world, India needs to shift comprehensively to cash support, so that the vulnerable don’t fall through gaps—thanks to poor implementation, the bulk of beneficiaries of the free-grains announced under the corona relief package by the Union government were unable to receive these in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030.

The launch of this bond builds on the bank’s previous renewable energy Green Bonds, which were significantly oversubscribed, and the proceeds of which are now funding a number of high-potential solar and wind renewable energy projects.

AfDB concludes $116m Nedbank SDG-linked bonds

Green bonds can help raise finance to meet climate targets

According to Mike Davis, the group executive for balance sheet management at Nedbank, this R2 billion (around $116 million) SDG bond underscores Nedbank’s commitment to driving sustainable development in Africa through the deployment of innovative funding mechanisms, to ensure that capital flows are orientated towards responsible investing.

“Our renewable energy bonds clearly demonstrated Nedbank’s commitment to facilitating asset finance with a focus on moving South Africa’s renewable energy agenda forward,” he explains, “but we have always recognised that maximising sustainable development funding requires capital or debt commitment as well; and this sustainable capital instrument, with its green use-of-proceeds commitment, is our way of meaningfully delivering on this responsibility.”

…maximising sustainable development funding requires capital or debt commitment as well…

Davis points out that the launch of this sustainable capital instrument, which was designed and created in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), allows Nedbank to give even greater effect to its stated purpose to use its financial expertise to do good.

“The use-of-proceeds commitment that underpins this capital instrument not only provides evidence that Nedbank is providing significant financial support to the Sustainable Development Goals, and particularly SDG 7,” he explains, “but also serves as a significant drawcard for foreign investment in South Africa, which is sorely needed at this point, if for no other reason than to help the country build fiscal and monetary resilience and to see it through the challenging economic times that lie ahead.”

The significance of this sustainable capital instrument is further emphasised by the fact that it comes a little over a month after Nedbank’s shareholders unanimously voted in support of two new sustainable development resolutions.

These commit the bank to adopting and publicly disclosing an energy policy and reporting fully on its approach to measuring, disclosing and assessing its exposure to climate-related risks.

Davis says that the launch of the sustainable capital instrument is a prime example of Nedbank putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to delivering on these resolutions.

Green bonds: Long-term impact

The instrument is effectively the bank’s commitment to funding the origination of impact-based assets that will not only promote immediate proactive sustainable development, but also ensure the long-term sustainability and positive impact of the bank’s balance sheet into the future.

“With the imminent launch of the JSE Sustainability Segment later in July, it is imperative that banks fully embrace the absolutely vital role they must play in enabling and driving sustainable socioeconomic development for the benefit of all,” Davis emphasises,”not only by facilitating third-party investment, but also through the appropriate application of capital into where it is needed most.”

This Bond has been validated independently by the Carbon Trust who provided a second party opinion and reaffirmed that this capital instrument aligns fully to the Green Bond Principles, thereby lending full credibility and transparency to the utilisation of the proceeds to support sustainable development initiatives and adding significant value to the instrument and its investors.

Stefan Nalletamby, the director for the financial sector department at the African Development Bank, congratulated Nedbank on its launch of South Africa’s first ‘green’ tier 2 capital instrument and expressed the hope that this would be the first of many such instruments, representing a groundswell of innovative capital commitment to sustainable development by the country’s financial institutions.

The use of proceeds aligns with AfDB’s “Light Up and Power Africa” High 5 priority which entails providing clean energy to the South African / SADC power pool.

Nalletamby said, “We are very pleased to be able to support the South African economy by injecting investment into the private sector through a responsible and trusted partner committed to responsible investing. This investment will help accelerate the recovery of the economy from the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”

“The successful launch of this instrument demonstrates the growing appetite in South Africa for sustainable and renewable investment on both sides of the balance sheet,” Davis points out, “and this will not only help to underpin and drive the development of South Africa’s green economy, but also send a very powerful message that it is time for both borrowers and investors to get fully behind the green agenda.”","An innovative SDG-linked instrument, listed on the Green Bonds segment of the JSE, has set a record as South Africa’s first ‘green’ tier 2 capital instrument launched by Nedbank.

Azerbaijan has ranked 54th among 166 countries with an overall index score of 72.6, the report revealed. The country of 10 million people demonstrated a strong commitment to all seventeen goals given the overall indicators outlined in the document.

""According to the sustainable development goals index, Azerbaijan is a regional leader. Our country ranks 54th, leaving behind all its neighbors,"" Vusal Gasimli, Executive Director of the Center for the Analysis of Economic Reforms and Communication was quoted by Fed.az as saying in response to the report. ""Russia is 57th, Georgia 58th, Iran 59th, Kazakhstan 65th, Turkey 70th, Armenia 75th, and Turkmenistan 114th in the report.""

He went on to add that Azerbaijan made progress on UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as health, welfare, poverty, nutrition, clean water, clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, peace, justice and strong institutions.

The SDGs are a key focus of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all member states of the United Nations in 2015. Under the key principle of “leaving no one behind,” the agenda mandates a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all around the planet now and into the future. The 17 SDGs, aimed at transforming the world for the better, include no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequality; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships to achieve the goal.

Azerbaijan achieved sustainable development goals in terms of ""no poverty"" according to this year's records. The entire population of the country has access to electricity, while 91.4 percent use basic drinking water services and 98.5 percent have access to improved water sources, according to the report. Around four-fifth or 79.8 percent of the country's ten million population use the internet.

The Caspian country improved its performance in the category of security and safety, compared to the previous report. The homicide rate per 100,000 people is 2.0, which was 2.1 in the 2019 report. Walking alone at night in the city or area where they live is safe for 82.4 of the population, meant to be 7.7 percent more than in the last year.

Despite the 99.9 percent literacy rate among the population aged 15 to 24, Azerbaijan recorded a decrease in the quality of education index due to the declined net primary enrollment rate (92.4%) and low secondary completion rate (84.4%). In the previous report, these two rates were indicated at 93.7 percent and 88.45 percent respectively.

""Azerbaijan scored 72.6 out of a possible 100 points in the Sustainable Development Goals Index. For comparison, the average Sustainable Development Goals Index in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is 70.9,"" Gasimli said while mentioning also the 38.6 Gini coefficient of the country, which, according to him, is one of the world's best outcomes of its kind. The Gini coefficient or Gini index/Gini ratio is a statistical measure of economic inequality in a population.

The government of Azerbaijan approved a strategic roadmap for the social and economic development of the key sectors with short-term (by 2020), medium-term (by 2025), and long-term target outlooks (beyond 2025), of which many goals fit in with the SDGs. The country was among the pioneers of the region to undertake missions designed for identifying definitive steps that would help accelerate the implementation of SDGs.

These achievements followed drastic improvements in ease of doing business in Azerbaijan. In the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report for 2018, Azerbaijan claimed a spot among the top ten socio-economic reformers. During the same year, Azerbaijan hosted the first high-level forum on sustainable development, a platform for looking into practical solutions to challenges involving inclusive economic growth, productive employment, gender equality, youth participation, peaceful coexistence and justice for all, as well as access to clean resources and tackling climate change.","Azerbaijan scored the best results among Caspian Sea and South Caucasus countries evaluated in the Sustainable Development Report 2020, which measures the commitment of 166 nations to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by the United Nations.

The government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Prime Minister James Marape’s speech to the UN High-level political forum was delivered by National Planning Minister Sam Basil. It showcased the achievements and challenges of PNG. The conference was conducted at the APEC Haus early this morning via the United Nation’s website.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals range from Good Health and Well Being to Eliminating Poverty, Hunger and Climate Action.

Being a member of the United Nations, PNG adopted “Agenda 2030’ in the 70th session of the General Assembly in 2015.

This means PNG has agreed to measure its performances on development against the global benchmarks using indicators of the 17 SDGs.

In the first five SDGs, where it focuses on Ending Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well Being, Quality Education and Gender Equality, Prime Minister Marape says the population living below the extreme poverty line as per the last national survey has improved from 53 percent of the total population in 1996 to 39 percent in 2010.

The Prime Minister has noted improvement in health statistics that shows an increase in life expectancy rates but made mention that more focus needs to be given to health issues like TB and Malaria.

The other 12 SDGs include decent work and economic growth to responsible consumption and production.

In these different goals, the Prime Minister noted that the local economy has grown from an average of 6 percent between 2010 and 2014, highlighting a peak in 2013 at 13 percent before declining in 2015 to a 9.5 percent.","Share the NewsThe government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

Addressing ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council) commemoration of UN's 75th anniversary, the Prime Minister said the 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' (together for everyone's growth with everyone's trust) motto resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind.

""India also contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the SDGs. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We are also supporting other developing countries in meeting their SDGs,"" he said.

""Our motto is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. This resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. Be it access to nutrition, health education, electricity or housing. We are making great progress through our inclusive programmes,"" the Prime Minister said.

He said other developing countries can learn from the scale and success of India's development programmes.

""It is this realisation that underpins India's own development partnership with the Global South,"" he said.

Noting that over the past few years India has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, he said this was achieved by electrifying our villages, providing clean cooking fuel to 80 million poor households and the introduction of energy-efficient measures.

""We have set a target to install 450 Gigawatt of renewable energy and restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. We have an age-old tradition of living in harmony with nature,"" Modi said.He said that the government has launched one of the largest campaigns for cleanliness and discouraged usage of single-use plastic. He stated that the setting up of International Solar Alliance was a practical manifestation of climate action.

""Similarly, the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure brings together all relevant stakeholders for a comprehensive approach. We have always prided ourselves as the first responder in our region -- a friend in need,"" the Prime Minister said.

Modi said that his government has given the highest priority to deliver benefits to the poor households.

""We have announced a package of more than USD 300 billion. It will bring the economy back on track, build modern infrastructure and put in place a technology-driven system. We have put forward a vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', a self-reliant and resilient India, integrated with the global economy,"" the Prime Minister said.

Talking about the COVID-19 fight, the Prime Minister said that the grassroots health system is ""helping India ensure one of the best recovery rates in the world"".

Speaking about his government's initiatives, Modi said that India achieved full sanitation coverage in 6,00,000 villages on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also spoke about the country's improvement in rural sanitation cover, food security and how women-oriented programmes have transformed lives and livelihoods.

""In five years, we built over 110 million household toilets, which improved our rural sanitation cover from 38 per cent to 100 per cent. Our massive awareness generation programmes are empowering our women. We have achieved gender parity in elementary and secondary education,"" he said.

The Prime Minister noted that nearly 70 million women in rural India are part of self-help groups under the Livelihood Mission. ""They are transforming lives and livelihoods on a big scale. Over a million women are elected representatives of our local governments, leading the process of participatory development,"" the Prime Minister said.

""In the last six years, we opened 400 million bank accounts for the unbanked, out of which 220 million are owned by women. We have leveraged the power of technology for financial inclusion. This is based on the trinity of a unique identity number, a bank account and a mobile connection for everyone. It has allowed us to make Direct Benefit Transfers of USD 150 billion to over 700 million people. Our food security programmes reach 813 million citizens,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that the 'Housing for All' programme will ensure that every Indian will have a safe and secure roof over his head by 2022, when India completes 75 years of independence. ""By then, 40 million new homes would have been made under this programme, more than the total number of households in many countries,"" he added.

“I feel very fortunate to have had such a long career at the County and I truly enjoyed my work,” Thomson said. “I have worked with many great Wardens, Councils and staff. The County has seen me through many of life’s milestones – getting married, having children and now grandchildren.”

Thomson said her decision to retire came with “mixed emotions” as she weighed her love of work along with her love of family.

“I discovered through the COVID shut down, I really enjoy being at home,” she said. “My office visitors were one-, two- and three-year-olds and a farmer who stopped for lunch. I have realized it is time.”

Thomson said she is looking forward to more time with her husband Don on their Martintown-area dairy farm. She and Don have three children, Drew, Kurtis and Kelsey, as well as five grandchildren, Brooke, Tristan, Scotlyn, Adelyn and Ashton. County CAO Tim Simpson congratulated Thomson on her decision and added a successor will have large shoes to fill.

“I have worked with many staff members over my own 30-year career in municipal government, and I can truly say that there is no one I have enjoyed working alongside more than Helen,” said Simpson. “Her loyalty to the County, professionalism, and work ethic are second to none. She has been my ‘go to’ colleague for almost 10 years and her retirement marks the end of an era in SDG.”

Warden Frank Prevost likewise congratulated Thomson on a most-deserving retirement.

“If I have a question, I know that Helen has the answer,” said Prevost. “On behalf of County Councils both past and present, I wish Helen all the best in her retirement and I know she will enjoy her time as a grandmother in the years to come.”

The County will begin work on a succession plan soon, with an update for County Council coming later this year.

The direct mail initiative will also include a letter from Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry MP Eric Duncan, and an insert from Cornwall Tourism.

The mailing is supported by Duncan and his constituency office. A supplementary direct mail initiative in North Glengarry will also be done as that municipality is not part of MP Duncan’s riding.

Tourism in Ontario is a $75 billion industry according to the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism, and Culture Industries. A recent survey by the ministry pointed to the economic recovery for the tourism industry to pre-COVID-19 levels may take up to five years.

Part of the provincial government’s initial strategy for domestic tourism is to promote hyper-local tourism.

SDG received over $78,000 funding. Part of the funding has been used to hire two summer students as Tourism Cycling Ambassadors.

The students will cycle the waterfront trail, interacting with cycling visitors and promoting tourism in SDG.

SDG Tourism is outfitting the students with its Ride with GPS platform to map out cycling tours to bring visitors in from the waterfront trail to other parts of the counties.

The report, published by Jordan Kelly-Linden under the title “COVID-19 dries up hopes of ending global water poverty by 2030, campaigners warn”, sheds light on the increasing water insecurity under the pandemic, rendering the sustainable development goal (SDG) of the UN to deliver safe water and sanitation for all by 2030 off track.

The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

The outbreak requires proper water and sanitation, and washing hands to maintain hygiene, according to the report, which adds that “more than 297,000 children less than five years die due to diarrhoea linked to inadequate wash facilities every year”.

""Poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid,"" the report adds.

""The water sector in Jordan has been able to provide water for all since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, especially potable, clean and safe water that matches the highest international standards,"" Assistant Secretary General and Spokesperson at the Water Ministry Omar Salameh told The Jordan Times on Monday.

Jordan has been working on securing water for all as per the UN’s SDG 6 on water and sanitation for all, Salameh said, noting that work focused on sustainable provision of water to citizens and refugees.

Salameh also said that the water sector has dealt with sanitation water through proper management and using sterilisation to prevent the transmission of the virus.

The ministry has also been working on utilising rainfall through expanding the capacity of dams, he concluded.

The UN's SDG 6 aims to provide access to safe and affordable drinking water, universally and equitably, no later than 2030, the report says, quoting International coordinator at End Water Poverty Al Hassan Adam as saying: ""Yet with just a decade to go and COVID-19 only complicating the issue, these basic human rights are not being met.""","The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

Article content SDG council recently approved a change order for skin patching on County Rd. 43, from intersection of South Street West to the south limits of the Chesterville Bridge for $83,000. Asphalt skin patching is a short term, economical pavement repair solution for small asphalt surfaces. It works by covering an isolated, damaged area of asphalt with new asphalt material, according to ACI Asphalt and Concrete. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG council approves various tenders Back to video “This is a request for council’s consideration, we’ve finished our cold-in place contract and we were able to finish under budget,” said Benjamin de Haan, director of transportation and planning services. “We didn’t need as much asphalt cement as we originally anticipated in that one.” “As we’re going through the different roadways, depending on the asphalt cement that we can recover, from the stuff we’re recycling, it does go up and down of what we need. We have the flexibility in that contract.”

Article content Council’s support was sought to address a small section of road that is in poor shape relative to surrounding sections, according to an administration report. Council previously approved a skin patch repair on County Rd. 43, between County Rd. 7 to South Street West in Chesterville, in July 2016. The skin patch was necessitated due to the poor shape of the section of the road, specifically the significant rut which had materialized in the westbound lane. Since the competition of this repair, this portion of the road has remained in good shape and has not shown the expected deterioration profile typical of a skin-patch repair. Last year, council additionally approved the completion of cold-in place recycling and hot mix paving on County Rd. 43, from Chesterville to County Rd. 31. The area which was treated in 2019 was specifically from the north end of the Chesterville Bridge to County Rd. 31. The consequence of the above noted work is that a 350 metre section of the County Rd. 43 between the south limits of the Chesterville Bridge to South Street West remains in poor shape, exhibiting some signs of failure and cracking distresses. The skin patch repair will consist of paddling and cross fall correction, with a full 25mm lift installed over the entire length. Also include in the price is the shouldering and key joints. The expectation is that this section will deteriorate similarly to the 2016 skin patch between County Rd. 7 and South Street West, ensuring that this small section remains on a similar deterioration profile to the adjacent section.

Article content Council approved a claim from a contractor as a result of increased costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Roto Mill Inc., a cold-in-place recycling contractor that had received a $2,697,419 contract from the county, to request an additional $37,130. The request was made due to the company having incurred additional costs due to the pandemic. “The submission we did receive was the direct invoices,” said de Haan. “It’s just hotel rooms. They did have to do extra health and safety and sanitization and a whole bunch of different things. Extra vehicles and extra costs that were not part of this claim, but the claim is strictly for extra hotel rooms they needed because they usually double-up their staff and they had to split them all apart. They were here for quite a length of time.” De Haan further stated that he felt sympathetic to the company, as it was required to change their whole operation due to the virus. Administration reported a surplus of about $260,000 as a result of favourable asphalt cement pricing and less than budgeted asphalt cement volumes. Based on projections, the hot mix contract is also expected to be completed on budget. It recommended that council use the surplus to offset the claim. At the start of the work, the contractor notified the county that they were expecting to encounter cost increases and challenges as a result of the pandemic, requesting that the council consider compensating them for reasonable and documented costs which would not have been included in the contract price. At the outset, the contractor indicated that they would be willing to provide all receipts to substantiate a claim, would not include any overhead or profit, and, would make any and all efforts to minimize the extra costs.

Article content Tender for culvert lining awarded to Edgewater Sewer Services Inc. Edgewater Sewer Services Inc. was recently awarded a tender for curried-in-place lining work to be undertaken at nine cross culverts throughout the counties. The tender is valued at $139,998. The liners that have been specified are designed to be standalone new pipes — the old pipes being lined simply act as a conduit. According to administration, these new liners have a 50-year service life. “What our plan was for the county, from an organization perspective was that of course we like to do culvert lining, it is very efficient,” said de Haan. “We get a lot of work done at relatively comparable, if not, cheaper prices then actual conventional replacement. We like to do this on culverts where the shape is still there, but it’s deteriorating. This liner goes in as a new pipe.” This type of culvert rehabilitation is becoming more popular because of its low impact on road users and pricing when compared to conventional culvert replacement, according to administration reports. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Article content DUNVEGAN — Perhaps one day there’ll be a COVID-19 exhibit. That’ll be determined down the road, but right now, the main focus for many of the cultural institutions in the region is simply re-opening during the pandemic, and another one did on Wednesday: the Glengarry Pioneer Museum, just down the road in Dunvegan. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. It's a new world too for Cornwall/SDG heritage and cultural sites Back to video “We’re excited to announce (the re-opening),” said Glengarry Pioneer Museum curator/administrator Jennifer Black, when the facility issued a new release about the beginning of the 2020 season. Acknowledging that COVID-19 has “created a new reality for Canadians,” Black noted life, like everywhere else, won’t be business as usual, that for the first time in its long history the Glengarry Pioneer Museum will be having visits made by reservation, with guests encouraged to phone or email to reserve an arrival time. “It’s a novel opportunity to reserve a heritage site knowing that there will only be a few other small groups besides you and your family,” Black said. “You can enjoy the grounds visiting the heritage buildings, (and) pack a picnic and stay a while.”

Article content Black said the museum may enjoy some advantages during the current situation, in that it is in a small and somewhat remote community in North Glengarry – an attractive destination for those in larger centres. And, because the population in Dunvegan and surroundings is small and the area is large, “it’s easier for us to meet the standards set by public health to ensure that we can once again open our doors,” she said. The museum will be open each day Wednesday to Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. More On This Topic Ontario tourism minister shares thoughts on sector's recovery Cornwall Community Museum adds model of HMCS Stormont to collection St. Lawrence loyalist association director wins youth achievement award Meanwhile, the limited public hours this month at Cornwall Community Museum in Lamoureux Park continue. There’s guided museum visitation each Saturday and Sunday, on the hour each day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and an appointment is recommended. Guided tours can have a maximum of three per group, or five if from the same household. On Thursdays, research can be done by appointment. Bookings can be made by calling 613-936-0280, or emailing cornwalllhistory@outlook.com. In Lakewood Heights near Long Sault, the Lost Villages Museum is expected to open this weekend. In Williamstown, the Glengarry, Nor’Westers and Loyalist Museum won’t be opening this season, as renovations continue at the building. Back in Dunvegan, Black said the facility has done everything possible to make sure that staff and visitors enjoy the quaint, historic site.

Article content “Staff will greet (guests) with a mask and offer either a guided or self-guided walking tour,” she said. “Physical distancing and making use of extra hand sanitizing stations around the site is necessary. (And), with several small, historic buildings on site, only one household or ‘bubble’ will be allowed in each building at a time.” There will be a strict ‘no-touching’ of the artifacts policy, and there’ll be increased cleaning and disinfecting throughout the facility. “People need to be mindful of our new reality for the time being,” Black said. “But having a fun outing to a local museum can be added to your list of things to do this summer. . .(the museum is) a hidden gem in North Glengarry. With the pandemic still looming, staying local and exploring your own backyard is something everyone should take advantage of.” For details about the site that has 10 heritage buildings spread out over 4.5 acres with vast green spaces, visit glengarrypioneermuseum.ca. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to video

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

Here’s a rather large sample of some of the graduation signs in Cornwall and across the area.","Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to videoBefore long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

According to the community, since the inception of the settlement, they have never seen any infrastructural development by either the federal or state government.

Muhammad Adamu and Ardo of Riyom, who spoke on behalf of the community, said building the school was an indication that they were being carried along, adding that the community had never experienced such development.

He said, ""No words of thanks will equate what SDG has done to us. This is what we have been praying for in the last hundreds of years. I am 60 years old and I have never seen this kind of development in Mahanga until now. We appreciate the gesture and hope to have other social amenities like boreholes, hospitals, and electricity.

Adamu, while expressing happiness over the development, however, denied the rumour that the community's name was changed from Rankum to Mahanga, adding that the area where the school was built was not Rankum. He called on Berom communities to join hands together to move the place forward.

The youth leader of the area and secretary to the Ardo, Abdullahi Yusuf Ibrahim, thanked the SDG for showing much concern towards their plight and called on the state government to deploy teachers to handle the school effectively.

He said, ""One of our many wishes is to have primary and secondary schools for our children to be attending. We have been yearning for something like this but could not succeed. Today, Allah has blessed us with this. We are indeed very grateful. Our major problem now is to have teachers who would be giving lessons to our children. ""

Ibrahim, therefore, called on both state goverment and Riyom LG council to complement the gesture by deploying teachers to the school.","Jos — Residents of Mahanga community in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State have applauded the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Office, for building the first primary school in the area.
According to the community, since the inception of the settlement, they have never seen any infrastructural development by either the federal or state government.
Muhammad Adamu and Ardo of Riyom, who spoke on behalf of the community, said building the school was an indication that they were being carried along, adding that the community had never experienced such development.
I am 60 years old and I have never seen this kind of development in Mahanga until now.
Ibrahim, therefore, called on both state goverment and Riyom LG council to complement the gesture by deploying teachers to the school."

Participants highlighted several ways to address gender inequalities in the ‘SAICM Beyond 2020’ process.

The session on 26 August 2020 was facilitated by Andrea Rother, University of Cape Town, who informed participants that the CoP was initiated to contribute to solving policy problems. In addition to gender, the CoP plans to address cross-cutting challenges in the areas of biodiversity and climate change.

Sara Brosché, IPEN, offered opening remarks to kick off the exchange of ideas, which was conducted entirely in the written chat section of the virtual meeting platform. To set the stage, Brosché highlighted that, without gender equality in the area of chemicals and waste, the SDGs will not be achieved. She noted that women are affected by inequalities in exposure to chemicals and waste. While gender is a socially constructed concept that refers to the norms, roles, expressions, and identities of women, men, boys, girls, and gender-diverse people, she explained that biological sex is also relevant due to biological impacts of exposure to chemicals and waste. Brosché added that gender is often discussed in relation to SDG 5 (gender equality), but targets under SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and others also apply.

Participants proceeded to exchange ideas on a series of three questions. On the first question, “in the context of chemicals and waste, what is your experience with gender equality when it comes to participation in decision-making on a local, national or global level?,” one discussant said they were not aware of chemical legislation that specifically refers to gender issues until participating in the CoP. Others provided examples of gender balance from international organizations and federal governments, while another noted that at the multinational company where they worked, gender and chemicals issues were not on the agenda.

On the second question, “do you think there are gender inequalities when it comes to exposure to and impact of chemicals and waste management?,” a participant said the data indicate that the biggest gender imbalance is due to occupational exposure, where men are more exposed. However, another participant pointed to the lack of gender-disaggregated information on effects of exposure to chemicals beyond the workplace. One participant suggested that men are more directly exposed because they perform “risky tasks,” while impacts on women may be longer-term and under-diagnosed.

On the third and final question, “What actions do you think would help address gender inequalities on a local and global level?,” suggestions included:

Establishing a gender focal point in the SAICM Secretariat;

Establishing a gender working group to develop a gender action plan for SAICM Beyond 2020;

Ensuring that SAICM national focal points have gender expertise;

Incorporating gender into national action plans;

Collecting data on gender and risk assessment;

Using the Global Burden of Disease resource, which provides gender-disaggregated data, to track a SAICM Beyond 2020 target on reducing the gender gap for negative health impacts; and

Developing a repository of existing strategies.

The Chemicals and SDGs Community of Practice will hold its next discussion on 30 September 2020, on the topic of accelerating the implementation of SDG target 12.4 (By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment).

The SAICM Secretariat has formed four Communities of Practice to bring together representatives from different sectors to focus on challenges related to the sound management of chemicals and waste. These voluntary networks comprise members with expertise and interest in specific thematic areas.

That year will mark the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972, and established the UN Environment Programme.

In May 2018, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) mandated a series of negotiations to consider possible gaps in international environmental law and environment-related instruments, with a view to strengthening their implementation (resolution 72/277, ‘Towards a Global Pact for the Environment’). These meetings took place in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2019.

The resulting recommendations did not call for creating a new international instrument to address legal gaps, but instead for the UNGA to:

Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to strengthen, “where needed,” environmental laws, policies and regulatory frameworks at the national level, as well as capacities across all sectors for effective implementation of international environmental law (IEL), including in the administrative and justice sectors, in accordance with national legal systems;

Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to mainstream environment into sectoral policies and programmes at all levels, including into national development and sustainable development plans;

Encourage the “active and meaningful engagement” of all relevant stakeholders at all levels in the different forums related to the implementation of IEL and environment-related instruments;

Encourage the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), as chair of the Environment Management Group, to continue to strengthen system-wide inter-agency coordination on the environment, and to call for the implementation of system-wide strategies on the environment; and

Forward the recommendations to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) for consideration, and for UNEA to prepare, at its fifth session (UNEA-5), a political declaration for a UN high-level meeting, subject to voluntary funding, in the context of commemoration of UNEP’s creation in 1972, with a view to strengthening the implementation of IEL.

The UNGA endorsed these recommendations in August 2019 (resolution 73/333). To follow up on that mandate, the Committee of Permanent Representatives to UNEA is holding a series of three informal substantive consultation meetings. The co-facilitators for the consultations are Saqlain Syedah, Pakistan, and Ado Lohmus, Estonia.

Convening virtually from 21-23 July 2020, the Committee of Permanent Representatives held the first of its three meetings. According the report of the meeting released on 9 August, governments exchanged views on international environmental law and the appropriate focus for the political declaration.

A “large majority of States” stressed the importance of the Rio principles in the political declaration.

Some called for the declaration to advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.

The EU suggested that common understanding is needed on interpreting the principles of international environmental law, and Colombia and New Zealand called for stating the principles in the declaration. The Civil Society Group also supported agreeing on a set of principles for environmental rights.

The Africa Group and Chile preferred the declaration to focus on the means of implementation.

Turkey said the declaration should include practical measures of implementation, but no technical details.

The Civil Society Group favored “political commitments, targets and timelines.”

Japan said the political declaration is a chance to demonstrate strong political will to strengthen international environmental law and governance.

The EU called for the political declaration to include a follow-up mechanism.

The US reaffirmed that it will oppose action to follow up on the 2019 recommendations.

The second substantive consultation meeting is expected to take place in October 2020, and the third and final meeting in January 2021, with the aim of defining a “framework” for UNEA-5, which is expected to convene in February 2021.

The event convened on the sidelines of the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF), which took place virtually.

Plastic litter threatens the environment, human health, and business in marine and coastal settings. A spike in the use of single-use plastics due to the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this threat. Industry and the private sector play a crucial role in combating marine litter, with innovations on modes of production and consumption, waste management, and digital approaches.

Entrepreneurs and innovators are well positioned to develop new methods and technologies to deal with plastic PPE waste.

The side event titled, Engaging Industry through the Global Partnership on Marine Litter to deliver SDG 14, highlighted the need for more action on marine litter and provided examples on industry engagement. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told participants that, in 2015, only 9% of plastics was recycled, and damage from debris in the Asia-Pacific region totaled around USD 11 billion. She pointed to a resurgence in single-use plastic products with increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. To combat marine litter and plastic pollution, Andersen stressed the importance of: multilateralism and partnerships; engaging industry along the entire value chain; managing and recycling plastic waste from COVID-19; and reversing or halting production of single-use plastic products.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Norway’s Minister of International Development, said two billion people lack access to waste management. He noted Norway’s programme to reduce marine litter in developing countries and a multilateral trust fund for healthy oceans, to which Norway provided the initial contribution. Ulstein said the Nordic Ministers of Environment Climate produced a report on possible elements of a new global treaty on marine litter. He expressed hope that, during the fifth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5), countries would determine a path for such an agreement. He mentioned a forthcoming report from Norway on how industry can create a framework for healthy oceans.



Sabine Pahl, University of Plymouth, provided an overview of global actions to reduce the flow of marine plastic and microplastic to the ocean. She noted the voluntary reporting of 158 actions, 119 of which involve partnerships. She said an interactive dashboard and repository is under development to facilitate information sharing.



Simon Bennett, China Navigation Company (CNCo) and Swire Pacific Offshore Operations, described the Moana Taka Partnership, which CNCo established with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment (SPREP). The Partnership enables CNCo ships to carry recyclable waste from Pacific island ports, at no cost, to be sustainably treated and recycled in suitable ports in the Asia-Pacific region. He encouraged other shipping companies to adopt similar modalities, including in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions.



Susan Ruffo, Executive Director, Circulate Initiative, suggested engaging with entrepreneurs and innovators, who are well positioned to develop new methods and technologies to deal with PPE as a result of COVID-19.



Other speakers included representatives from:

WWF South Africa, who advocated for beginning negotiations on a legally binding treaty on plastic pollution;

the UNEP Cartagena Convention Secretariat, who stressed the need to fully engage industry and the private sector to achieve SDG 14;

IBM, who urged “thinking big, starting small and scaling fast,” using innovation and digital tools such as AI to provide guidance on preventing marine litter, and connecting stakeholders through a multi-sector collaboration platform; and

the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, who underscored the need to unlock more investment focused on infrastructure, innovation, education, and clean-up.

Wallace Cosgrow, Seychelles’ Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, and Co-Chair of the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), noted that because “the entire value chain of plastic is a transboundary issue,” on-the-ground work must merge to form a shared vision. He urged governments to achieve SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14, particularly those Goals’ targets related to reducing waste regeneration.

CBD Shifts SBSTTA and SBI to 2021

On 24 August 2020, the CBD Secretariat announced that it “is now clear that it will not be possible to convene any large physical intergovernmental meeting this year,” due to the global pandemic. Following consultations with the Bureaux of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD and its Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), as well as the Chair of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI), meetings of SBSTTA 24 and SBI 3 – the dates for which had been shifted several times – are being moved to the first quarter of 2021, “conditions allowing.” The Chairs, Bureaux, and Secretariat will consider options for virtual discussions in November.

In preparation for the SBSTTA and SBI meetings, the CBD Secretariat will convene virtual sessions in September 2020. The launch of the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook report (GBO-5) will also take place in September.

New dates for the third meeting of the Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework have not yet been announced.

The Secretariat also announced that the President of the CBD COP, Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment of Egypt, has requested an extraordinary meeting of the COP and the meetings of the Parties to the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols (COP-MOPs) at the end of 2020. The purpose of the ExCOP would be to consider and approve an interim budget for the Secretariat’s operations in 2021. The Parties are expected to consider the draft budget decision either through a silence/written procedure or a virtual meeting that would take place within the period from 16-19 November 2020.

CBD COP 15 was originally scheduled to take place in October 2020. Following an announcement on 15 July 2020, the meeting is now expected to take place from 17-30 May 2021, in Kunming, China.

UNFCCC Considering Additional Event in 2021

On 28 May 2020, the UNFCCC COP Bureau decided that the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), which was originally scheduled to take place from 9-19 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK, will take place from 1-12 November 2021, still in Glasgow.

Subsequently, at the end of June 2020, the COP Bureau decided to postpone the meetings of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB52) until 2021, at a date to be decided. During the time frame during which the SB52 meetings were originally scheduled, the Secretariat organized a series of virtual events under the banner, ‘June Momentum on Climate Change.’

In related news, during a UNFCCC COP Bureau meeting on 25 August 2020, the Bureau decided that “there could be an additional third session in 2021 if needed to catch up on work,” in order to be prepared for COP 26 in November 2021, according to a report from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group on Climate Change.

The framework will succeed the Istanbul Programme of Action for the LDCs (IPoA), which concludes in 2020.

On 11 August 2020, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution on the scheduling of the Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC-V), which originally was planned for March 2021. In recognition of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Assembly agrees in resolution 74/232 B that the Conference will take place instead from 23-27 January 2022, “at the highest possible level, including Heads of State and Government,” in Doha, Qatar. The intergovernmental preparatory committee will meet from 24-28 May 2021, and from 26-30 July 2021.

In addition, the text invites the UNGA President and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to hold a half-day dedicated thematic event during the 75th UNGA session, to provide substantive input to the Conference.

The Conference is expected to yield a programme of action to build upon the IPoA for 2011-2020, adopted at the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs (UNLDC-IV) in 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. The goal of the that ten-year Programme was to overcome LDCs’ structural challenges in order to eradicate poverty and achieve internationally agreed development goals. The 2022 conference is expected to appraise the results and adopt a new, strengthened framework to support LDCs.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the LDCs, the Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) notes that the new LDC programme of action will be adopted at “a critical time, as it will coincide with the last 10 years of implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

In July 2020 the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution expressing concern about persistent gaps between the goals of the IPoA and achievements made to date. It notes that 80% of the world’s poor will live in fragile contexts by 2030, which poses “a major global threat to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” It also urges intensified cooperation to “contain, mitigate and defeat” COVID-19 and stresses the LDCs’ particular need for support.

The IIGCC developed the ‘Net Zero Investment Framework’ with over 70 leading global investors representing an aggregate of over USD 16 trillion in assets. The guide is intended to enable investors to adopt a strategy to decarbonize their investment portfolios while increasing investment in climate solutions to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The Framework is “based on the expectation that governments and policy makers will deliver on commitments to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.” The IIGCC designed the Framework to help deliver “additional meaningful long-term emission reductions,” overcoming limitations in other approaches “based only on portfolio emissions reduction or portfolio temperature targets,” which allow investors to “technically meet targets while selling the problem to someone else.”

The Framework provides a comprehensive set of recommended actions, metrics, and methodologies to enable both asset owners and managers to become “net zero investors.” It covers four asset classes: sovereign bonds; listed equities; corporate fixed income; and real estate, with other asset classes to follow. The Framework identifies five core components of a net zero investment strategy: governance and strategy; objectives and targets; strategic asset allocation; asset class alignment; and policy advocacy and market engagement.

The Framework is open for consultation until 25 September 2020. Five investors – APG, Brunel, the Church of England Pensions Board, PKA, and Phoenix Group – are testing the Framework by modeling its impact across the performance of their portfolios, collectively valued at USD 1.3 trillion. Results of this analysis will be included in the final Framework, expected to be released later in 2020.

The IIGCC is a European membership body for collaboration on climate change. The organization includes over 240 members, mostly pension funds and asset managers, across fifteen countries, representing over EUR 33 trillion in assets under management. The Framework is a key output of the IIGCC’s Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII), which was established at the request of European asset owners to develop key definitions and concepts relating to the alignment of investment strategies to the Paris Agreement.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take hold in many countries, indigenous peoples are among the most vulnerable. Already dealing with multiple challenges, including threats to their ancestral lands and forests, growing food insecurity, and the impacts of climate change, indigenous peoples and local communities are further disadvantaged during the pandemic. Many live in remote areas and have poor access to food, basic healthcare, and communication. As the crisis continues to evolve, indigenous peoples are further marginalized as information is rarely available in their local languages.

Further, lockdowns have created insecure and unstable markets, such as in Nepal. This has given rise to arbitrary transport and purchase prices, setting back producer groups who have no access and information on market operations during the pandemic. Moreover, women now carry twice their normal workload – as primary caretakers of families and households, and as custodians of farms and animals.

Despite these challenges, indigenous communities remain resilient by relying on their traditional knowledge and practices. Represented by their traditional organizations and a large variety of different forest and farm producer organizations (FFPOs) in various countries, indigenous peoples have platforms for inclusion and decision making. These organizations have vast networks that represent women, youth, and ethnic minorities, and often have constitutions that target such vulnerable groups.

In many instances, FFPOs provide the only organized response to local needs in times of crisis – be it economic, environmental, or in this case a health crisis.

For example, responding to livestock market closures in Kenya, the community-based Laikipia Livestock Marketing Cooperative Society has established a local charity basket to supply food for vulnerable families. They have also helped train health volunteers and supported the local county in distributing personal protective equipment to clinics.

The Cotton Association of Zambia has been raising awareness of gender equality with farmer and civic leaders from local communities to reduce sexual harassment and gender-based violence, particularly during lockdown.

And in Ghana, the Community Action in Development and Research has been providing seed capital to 25 small women’s groups and has been promoting alternative forms of livelihoods such as soap making and moringa production.

Meanwhile, in Ecuador, the government has recognized the important role of FFPOs by inviting them to attend the newly established Emergency Committee in response to COVID-19. This gives FFPOs leverage to accelerate new policies, programmes, incentives, and stimulus packages that will benefit member-owned groups and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Notably, FFPOs draw on their traditional knowledge and experiences, and have offered local, grounded solutions to improve production systems even before the pandemic. Local producers in Ecuador, for instance, add value to their agri-food products by using the Amazon Chakra seal, a label that is internationally recognized for upholding social and cultural values of the chakras, an ancestral agroforestry system practised by Kichwa communities. The chakra land-use system maintains the functions and services of the fragile Amazon ecosystem, and provides indigenous families with income, food security, and resilience to climate change. With the Amazon Chakra seal espousing these values, consumers are more motivated towards responsible consumption.

In Viet Nam, around 100 Dzao ethnic minority households in the mountains of Yen Duong in Bac Kan province have taken great care in preserving the ancestral way of growing Nep tai sticky rice. Only a few select families who have maintained traditional cultivation practices, from seed selection to harvesting to drying, are entrusted with production to ensure high quality and value. Traditional knowledge is proving its value in many countries as the COVID-19 virus threatens health and is driving many to build self-reliance in food systems and livelihoods.

It is in this spirit of social inclusion and integrity that governments and the international community need to engage indigenous peoples by supporting their rights, including the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent, but also by strengthening the capacity of their organizations, FFPOs, and programmes that build back better production systems. There cannot be a more apt time to do this as we observe International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples today.

We can make a difference by supporting national governments to design response strategies by involving national level FFPOs and indigenous peoples’ organizations in policy and decision making. We can help them to replicate practical solutions and have access to on-going support. We can assist more indigenous women to be fully integrated in all decision making related to COVID-19 and beyond, and enable more women in leadership positions. FFPOs and their spirit of inclusion in planning and implementing resilience programmes are key to ensuring that indigenous peoples, among the world’s poorest and most vulnerable, are not left behind as nations contend with the aftermath of the pandemic, but are recognized and supported as leaders of innovative solutions.

Following up on the analytical framework used to develop this estimate, as published in ESCAP’s ‘Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2019: Ambitions beyond Growth,’ the Commission has now published a practical Guidebook to help policy makers and other stakeholders estimate their investment needs for implementing the SDGs.

Titled ‘A Guidebook for Assessing SDG Investment Needs,’ the publication is paired with an online dashboard on SDG investment trends.

The Guidebook seeks to support countries in their implementation of Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs). It recommends that costing SDG implementation should be “viewed as an integral part of effective planning which could also help countries develop an ambitious yet realistic financing strategy.” It further highlights that the “process of identifying interventions to be costed, their intended beneficiaries and the responsible service providers could result in improved policy design and implementation.” This result would occur if, for example, an SDG-related intervention cuts across the mandates of multiple government ministries and agencies and thus requires coordination from multiple actors to clarify responsibilities.

The Guidebook notes that costing SDG implementation is different from other costing exercises due to what is being costed. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes universal access and leaving no one behind, which should be reflected in the costing of targets, scenarios and interventions. In addition, SDG costing should consider the interlinkages across the Goals. It notes that some targets do not include numerical outcomes, leaving room for each country to identify what is nationally appropriate.

The Guidebook provides a Goal by Goal evaluation of considerations to take into account when costing SDG implementation.

The third meeting of the CPTPP Commission convened virtually on 5 August 2020, and was hosted by Mexico.

The joint statement recognizes the “unprecedented challenges” posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the health and well-being of communities, social cohesion, livelihoods, and adherence to the principles of free and open trade. The statement highlights CPTPP members’ “commitment to rules-based trade by maintaining open supply chains, active communication, transparency, and prompt notification of trade measures.” It underscores the importance of countering protectionism and reinforcing “an open, effective, fair, inclusive and rules-based trading system to restore economic growth worldwide.”

The CPTPP members express their resolve to continue work towards post-COVID-19 economic recovery by establishing and strengthening supply chains, and examining ways the CPTPP could be used to facilitate digital trade responses to COVID-19. The countries commit to avoid “unjustified trade restrictive measures” and to facilitate the flow of essential goods and services during the COVID-19 crisis, including medical supplies and equipment, medicines, and agriculture and food products “in a manner consistent with international trade rules.”

The CPTPP members reaffirm their “strong commitment” to upholding and supporting the World Trade Organization (WTO), which “sits at the core of the rules-based Multilateral Trading System.” The countries indicate that they “will work to inject increased momentum into WTO reform, including of its dispute settlement system.”

The CPTTP Agreement entered into force on 30 December 2018. The inaugural meeting of the CPTPP Commission took place on 19 January 2019 in Tokyo, Japan, where members discussed elements needed for effective implementation of the Agreement, and how it can be expanded in the future. The Commission adopted a joint statement and four decisions on: an approach to administering the Agreement; rules of procedures for dispute settlement panels; a code of conduct for investor-state dispute settlement; and a process for the accession of new economies to the CPTPP.

The Commission’s second meeting convened from 7-9 October 2019, in Auckland, New Zealand, to monitor and advance implementation of the CPTPP’s obligations. The Commission issued a joint statement, and adopted decisions on its rules of procedure and on the establishment of a roster of individuals who may be selected to serve as panel chairs to address state-to-state disputes.

The role of trade deals has become the subject of heightened debate amid the economic effects of COVID-19, as governments consider how to support vulnerable sectors, ensure access to medicines and medical technologies for their populations, and address job losses. Prior to the pandemic, experts had begun questioning whether the CPTPP yielded the expected economic benefits for the seven ratifying countries.

In addition, the agreement’s rules on intellectual property (IP) and digital trade, among other issues, play into debate within some CPTPP signatory countries on whether to proceed with ratification, and for other countries regarding whether to request accession.

The release shows a continued drop in goods trade associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but hints at the early beginnings of stabilization.

The WTO publishes two sets of indicators, each launched in September 2019. The Goods Trade Barometer (formerly the World Trade Outlook Indicator) shows how the latest data points compare to short-term trends in goods trade, providing an indication of potential trajectory in the near future based on a variety of component indices that are combined into a single composite index. The Services Trade Barometer combines six component indices into a composite index to illustrate the current state of services prior to the release of official statistics. Each is intended to complement traditional trade statistics and forecasts.

An L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, recovery trajectory cannot be ruled out.

Each barometer is normalized for medium-term trends, with a score of 100 indicating growth in line with medium-term trends. Scores that exceed 100 indicate above-trend growth, and those below 100 show below-trend growth. Scores that deviate by more than 5 points are considered substantially above or below trend.

A WTO release notes that the latest Goods Trade Barometer’s composite score of 84.5 is 15.5 points below the baseline value of 100 for the index and down 18.6 points year-on-year. This scoring is generally consistent with the WTO’s June statistics, which imply a 14% drop in global trade volume between the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. While nearly all drivers of goods trade considered (export orders, automotive products, container shipping, air freight, electronic components, and raw materials) have declined, the WTO suggests that the indices “have held up relatively well” and that world trade in 2020 may be evolving in line with the less pessimistic scenario outlined in an April forecast. The release cautions however, that a “V-shaped” recovery is uncertain, and emphasizes the possibility of an “L-shaped” pathway where global trade levels out “well below its pre-pandemic trajectory.”

A methodology document notes that the Trade Goods Barometer is published quarterly, whereas the Services Trade Barometer is updated twice per year.

On technical barriers to trade, the parties made “good progress” on technical regulations, conformity assessment, and market surveillance. The report on the meeting indicates that the parties will discuss cooperation and technical assistance “in the wider context of development cooperation.”

On sanitary and phytosanitary issues, the parties made progress “with an agreement in principle on pre-listing and an agreement on the recognition of regionalization (zoning) with a view to a more sustainable trade in food products.” The parties committed to consider a provision for a framework on equivalence, and agreed on the “utmost importance” of cooperation and technical assistance.

The resource titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Your Community Foundation: Guidebook and Toolkit,’ was developed with funding from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. It focuses on Canadian community foundations’ efforts to work in their own contexts, but also provides information for community organizations around the world.

The Guidebook introduces the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs, and the core principles embodied in them, namely universality, local-level action, leaving no one behind, interconnected and indivisible, and partnerships. It highlights that these principles are particularly relevant to community foundations, which seek to convene local actors, foster partnerships, and spark action to address the needs of diverse groups.

The Guidebook also includes information on Canada’s approach to advancing the SDGs nationally. Canada presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The following year, the Government of Canada released an interim report titled, ‘Towards Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy.’ This report identifies five national priorities: leadership, governance, and policy coherence; awareness, engagement, and partnership; accountability, transparency, and reporting; reconciliation and the 2030 Agenda; and investing in the SDGs.

The SDG Toolkit portion of the resource identifies practical approaches to align an organization’s work with the SDGs. It offers ideas for how a group can select the first steps to take, identify existing alignment with the SDGs, plan for future alignment, and learn from examples of other community foundations.

Among the interconnected challenges for organizations seeking to align with the SDGs, the resource identifies: time constraints, given that the SDGs have a tight deadline for action; and the need to learn a new “language,” build capacity and new partnerships, and break out of silos.

The CFC is also supporting community foundations working on the SDGs through its Vital Signs program, which is prioritizing the collection of data that aligns to the 2030 Agenda to make relevant and standardized indicators available to community foundations. The toolkit notes that, in 2021, community foundations will have the opportunity to use a digital platform to host and share community data aligned to the SDGs.","The Community Foundations of Canada (CFC) has developed a guidebook and toolkit that offers examples, ideas, and steps for aligning an organization’s work with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

The Alliance’s report proposes 64 recommendations to harmonize and scale SDG financing and investment, with particular attention to the European Union (EU).

Released in early August 2020, the report titled, ‘Renewed, Recharged and Reinforced: Urgent actions to harmonize and scale sustainable finance,’ urges public and private leadership to achieve the SDGs. It calls for mobilizing private sustainable investment through fair and transparent risk-sharing agreements and making faster and scaled use of blended finance. The report argues that green investments alone will be insufficient to deliver the SDGs or the Paris Agreement on climate change; the entire economy and the whole financial system must “undergo a sweeping transition to a more sustainable future.” Proposals to deliver this transition include a financial incentive system that uses fiscal measures to rewards companies for creating sustainable stakeholder value and striving for sustainability outcomes.

Fiscal incentives could be used to reward companies for sustainability outcomes.

To move towards sustainability, the report underscores the “imperative of collective behavioral and policy alignment,” stressing that everyone must “row in the same direction in a coordinated way,” from aligning climate scenarios and risk methodologies for banks, to aligning policy lending and private investor flows. The report calls for addressing “inconsistent approaches to metrics” and poor quality, inconsistently disclosed sustainability data. The report recommends fixing these flawed metrics, aligning standards, and providing consistent information, and mandating confirmed disclosures to ensure SDG-related disclosures are built into existing governance structures. The report further calls for embracing partnerships, collaboration, and innovation to fund the Goals, including by investing in technologies and processes for metrics that support SDGs and sustainability.

Among their detailed recommendations, the members of the Alliance call for:

endorsing the Basel Committee’s high-level Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TCFR) to develop a framework for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) risk supervision applicable to global financial institutions;

making sustainability reporting mandatory for financial and non-financial institutions, including through globally harmonized disclosure requirements that go beyond climate metrics to include material SDG-related information and forward-looking data;

increasing the quality, ambition, and standardization of Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) for the 2030 Agenda and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the Paris Agreement, including by establishing an international platform for the development of investable national capital-raising plans and transaction-oriented investor engagement;

ensuring that public subsidies align with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement; and

diversifying and increasing bond issuance across the SDGs and drive green bond principles and standards into the project finance market.

The report responds to the European Commission’s (EC) Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy Consultation and features specific recommendations for the EU. Those recommendations include: requiring standardized ESG disclosures from companies participating in the EU Green Deal Investment Plan; elevating the Shareholder Rights Directive to the status of an EU Regulation; and elevating the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive to the status of an EU Regulation.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) developed the GISD Alliance in collaboration with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), based on the design of the Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development. The Alliance is part of the UN Secretary-General’s strategy for financing sustainable development, and aims to to provide leadership for mobilizing resource for sustainable development and to accelerate and scale up finance and investment for the SDGs.

Finishing with a 12-5 overall record, the 13U Angels reached the semifinals in all four of the Grand Slam Baseball tournaments they entered.

SDG (Soli Deo Gloria, meaning Glory to God Alone) began its journey June 5-7 in the Back-to-Baseball Blowout held at Signature Park in Braselton. In heartbreaking fashion, the Angels lost 9-6 to the Lambert Longhorns — a team they defeated 9-3 in the qualifying round — in the championship game to finish second in a field of seven teams.

Not to be denied, the Angels next played in the 11-team June Jam Summer Series Week 3, held June 19-21 at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula. SDG beat the Orange Crush from Clemson, S.C., 11-9 in the Championship game to finish 4-1 in the tournament. Crowned Tournament Champions on Father’s Day, each Angel was presented with a championship ring.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

The joint publication titled, ‘Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation: Intersections between Public Health, Intellectual Property and Trade,’ provides an update since the first edition’s launch in 2013. The study presents new data on health, innovation trends in the pharmaceutical sector, and trade and tariffs relating to medical products, capturing insights from joint technical assistance activities and taking into account developments in intellectual property legislation and jurisprudence.

The study “draws practical lessons from experiences regarding how public health, IP, trade and competition rules all interact with each other in the broader context of the human rights dimension of health and the [SDGs].” Given recent rapid changes in these policy arenas due to COVID-19, a WTO landing page for the study notes that “a standalone section on COVID-19 was added at the start of the publication to map the multiple challenges posed by the pandemic in relation to the integrated health, trade and IP policy frameworks set out in the study,” given that the report had been completed prior to the virus’s outbreak.

The COVID-19 section points readers to specific chapters, sections, and sub-sections of the report, and provides additional relevant information on:

Meeting the demand for health technologies and medical services;

Preserving effective international trade;

The global IP system vis-à-vis the pandemic;

International initiatives to support research and development of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 technologies;

Regulatory responses; and

Efforts to ensure transparency.

International trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.

The study itself describes the need for policy coherence and the role of the three authoring institutions (Chapter 1), summarizes the policy landscape (Chapter 2), and offers detailed information on the issues that specifically pertain to medical innovation and the research and development landscape (Chapter 3) and access (Chapter 4). The report draws connections to the SDGs and means of implementation such as trade throughout. Chapter 2 highlights linkages to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals), and describes key elements of trade policy such as tariffs, government procurement rules, and free trade agreements (FTAs). Chapter 4 considers the impact of trade and trade policy on access to medicines and medical technologies.

Noting that “innovation cannot take place in isolation from concerns about access,” the study emphasizes the need to preserve the global trade’s integrity. It observes that “international trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.” Recognizing governments’ recent implementation of trade-restrictive emergency measures such as export restrictions, the report also stresses “the importance of well-functioning supply chains and the need to facilitate cross-border flows of vital medical supplies and services.”

With the EU, the US, China, and Switzerland accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total share of health-related product exports, the majority of the global community appears reliant on imports. The study notes that from 1995 to 2018, “substantial and widening variations in per capita imports of health-related products” have been observed in countries at different levels of development, “highlighting stark differences in access to medicines.” Acknowledging the global trade regime’s increasing complexity, the study points to the existence of WTO agreements such as, inter alia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) as establishing rules to ensure that tariffs and non-tariff measures “do not become discriminatory or [become] unnecessary trade barriers.”

The WTO, WHO, and WIPO Directors-General each provided video remarks to support the launch of the study. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted the importance of close collaboration between the agencies, and joint global efforts more broadly, while WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry emphasized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for the removal of barriers to access, highlighting “unaffordable prices, intellectual property barriers, unjustified tariffs and challenges in ensuring effective and efficient regulatory review,” but also pointed to “unprecedented investments in collaborative, not-for-profit research” to tackle the shared threat of COVID-19.

While the pandemic demonstrates the immediate benefits of digital finance, the disruptive potential of digitalisation in transforming finance is immense. This is according to a new report, People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future, by the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance, which sets out an ambitious, practical action agenda.

Mobile payment technologies have transformed mobile phones into financial tools for more than a billion people.

Digital is supporting big data and artificial intelligence in advancing cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding platforms, and online marketplaces.

Commenting on the report, UN Secretary-General, António Guterres said: “Digital technologies, which are revolutionising financial markets, can be a game-changer in meeting our shared objectives. The Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals provides leadership to harness the digital revolution.”

According to the report, banks have invested over $1 trillion in developing, integrating and acquiring emerging technologies. In 2018, ‘fintech’ investment reached $120 billion. This is one third of global venture capital funding.

Centrally, the report spells out how digital finance can be harnessed in ways that empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at a scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs, collectively expressed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Digital finance responds to COVID-19 pandemic

Also commenting on the release of the report, Achim Steiner, administrator of UNDP and Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “Digital finance’s dramatic potential for transformative impact is being revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital transfers enable governments to get support to people in need, crowdfunding platforms have mobilised funds for medical supplies and emergency relief, and algorithmic lending means small businesses have quicker access to funds.”

The speed of the recent spread of these technologies is astonishing, but progress is not automatic said Steiner, adding that “for digitalisation to be a true force for delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals, technological advances must combine with sound policy that empowers citizens and enables our financial system to meet the urgent investment challenges that must be overcome to build forward better.”

The report highlights how billions of people around the world are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic using digital tools to work, spend and socialise. It argues there is a historic opportunity to harness digitalisation in placing citizens, the ultimate owners of the world’s financial resources, in control of finance to ensure that it meets their needs, today and in the future.

The Task Force identifies five catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalisation in aligning financing with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Together they cover much of global finance:

Aligning the vast pools flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs.

Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance that makes up a major part of the global economy.

Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance.

Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs.

Accelerating the lifeblood financing for the employment and income-generating world of small and medium-sized businesses.

The Task Force’s Action Agenda is a call to action to businesses, policy-makers and those governing finance to do what it takes to deliver on these opportunities. It spells out not only the ‘what’ but also the ‘how’: investments, new capabilities and governance innovations can get the job done.

The Task Force concludes that harnessing digitalisation for the good is a choice, not an inevitability driven by technology.

Its action agenda points to actions needed to overcome digital risks that, unmitigated, could deepen exclusion, discrimination and inequalities, and separate finance further from the needs of an inclusive, sustainable development.

243,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/08/14/esg-and-sdg-alpha-backed-by-the-blockchain/,"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes,ESG And SDG Alpha Backed By The Blockchain,"ESG means Environmental, Social & Governance. SDG means Sustainable Development Goals. SDGs are set by the UN. Most SDGs have ESG implications. ESG rated companies have become popular in investment portfolios. This is because the ESG standing of a company is a proxy for long term value, say the boosters of ESG based investing. The retail investor, by necessity, outsources research on ESG to professionals and invests in funds with a sustainable focus. The funds are meant to investigate the sustainable claims of many companies. Instead of doing so themselves, they rely on outfits like MCSI and Sustainalytics to choose the portfolio companies.

Much like the ratings agencies whose triple A rated bonds cratered as the financial crisis hit in 2008, these ESG raters do not and cannot stand by their scores when non-sustainable practices at firms with high ratings are exposed. Similar to those rating agencies who also got paid by their targets to rate the bonds that they issued, there is often a conflict of interest at the heart of these ratings. The scores are often proprietary and employ models and methods, including survey based results which rely on the enterprises to self-report. Self-reporting has never been a good method to rate enterprises or individuals.

Sustainable Development Goals Graphic from the UN

After laying bare the debate about ESG based investment strategies; some efforts to improve the quality and depth of the data and hence make the scores more objective are discussed. Some of these proposals use the blockchain to secure the truths about the business attested by programmatic or other verifiable metrics. A combination of methods probably works best, with suspicious activity getting investigated further, including the use of shoe leather.

The Skeptics

The US Labor department regulators recently released a proposed new rule, to clarify the ERISA guidelines as being concerned purely with pecuniary results. The new rule says that ESG ratings should not be used as a criteria for investment. Since this affects all investments by pension plans, it has a great influence on investment strategy and climate in the US; since pension plans control a huge chunk of investment. This new rule could be a huge problem for portfolio managers who are in charge of pension funds.

Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it. A well respected analyst has asserted that ESG ratings do not have anything to do with the better performance of ESG rated companies; since the difference in performance during the pandemic is due to the fact that energy companies and airlines who have poor ESG ratings cratered in first weeks of the pandemic. You can certainly apply this narrow logic to the performance metrics focused on a specific crisis. However, nothing can be said about the wider alpha generated by better ESG metrics. Indeed the better performance of ESG companies during the pandemic can be thought of as being generated by their resilience, better credit ratings and being relatively sheltered from black swans like the pandemic.

One more example is a company called Boohoo in the UK. Boohoo had received good ESG ratings from the ESG rating agencies which earned it a place on some portfolios in ESG funds. When news broke that their supply chain included vendors that underpaid their workers, the stock dove. These revelations resulted in its removal from the ESG funds. This points to the lack of depth in the rating; for a fashion brand suppliers matter. This is a case of a company receiving higher grades than they should have, because of the lack of proper due diligence.

ESG Proponents

The head of State Street Advisors STT , Cyrus Taraporevala, published an op-ed in the Financial Times arguing against the dept of labor rule about the Erisa guidelines and its proscription of ESG ratings as criteria for investing. Taraporevala is all for the guidelines that put the fiduciary responsibility of the portfolio managers to focus on pecuniary results. However, his argument is that ESG forward companies are better suited to weather the storms since they focus on employee well-being, resilience of supply chains and agile management. This is more true in the longer horizon which most pension plans should be focused on. He asserts that stocks with higher ESG ratings are better bets in the long term. Taraporevala does admit that there are some gray areas in measurement and accounting for ESG risks.

Measuring ESG

There was some talk in the ESG community that using the SDGs to measure ESG performance would be better, since they are finer grained and may be actually measurable. There are 17 headings there rather than just three in ESG.

For carbon emissions and other types of environmentally destructive activities where there can be a measure of objectivity, independent auditors and public data can bridge the transparency gap. The IWA has created a Carbon Emissions Token that includes several measurements and assertions. Nominally this would be on the blockchain so that the various parties who issue and monitor the token can assert to the measurements.

Another effort in the climate & accounting SIG in Hyperledger to setup utility emission channels will use public eGrid data, published by the EPA, along with the customer’s utility bills to calculate the emissions attributable to their energy consumption can be used to rate enterprises on their emissions profile. This uses a blockchain to capture this information from multiple parties. All of this point to the original use case for the blockchain to be a non-repudiable source of ordered documents.

Other ESG factors are harder to measure, especially the social and governance aspects. The ESG rating agencies who use a host of factors to calculate the ESG ratings will have to use many more automated methods using publicly available data; including some from blockchain anchored data stores. These methods will get better as time passes and ESG ratings will no longer be questioned as proxies for long term performance.","Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it.

Ontario’s 444 municipalities will receive a total of $695 million in the first phase, in order to assist in operating pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The success of Ontario’s municipalities is vital to our province’s economic recovery,” he said. “We’ve been working in partnership with municipalities from day one to understand the financial impacts of COVID-19, and this historic agreement will ensure they have the funding needed to address their most urgent local priorities.”

The funding’s announcement was made on Wednesday afternoon by Stormont, Dundas and South Glengarry MP Jim McDonell, who also serves as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

The City of Cornwall, along with the five SDG Counties, will be receiving funding through a partnership between both the provincial and federal government.

The United Counties of Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry will for their part, receive $1,762,300.

In all, Ontario secured up to $4 billion in emergency assistance for municipalities through the Safe Restart Agreement, which gives them the support and flexibility they need to protect the health and well-being of their communities, while continuing to deliver critical public services as the province continues on the path of economic recovery.

“This new funding will provide municipalities with the support they need to protect the health and well-being of the people of Ontario, while continuing to deliver critical public services,” added McDonell.

In addition to the support for municipalities, the government is providing over $660 million in the first phase of transit funding to the 110 municipalities with transit systems. The funding can be used to provide immediate relief from transit pressures, such as lower ridership, as well as for new costs due to COVID-19, such as enhanced cleaning and masks for staff.

Cornwall will receive an additional $687,352 in order to support transit operations. It was reported by city officials on Monday that Cornwall Transit ridership was now at 30 per cent due to the pandemic.

In the second phase, additional allocations will be provided based on expenses incurred to ensure the funding meets the needs of municipalities. As part of the Safe Restart Agreement with the federal government, up to $2 billion is being provided to support public transit in Ontario.","The City of Cornwall, along with the five SDG Counties, will be receiving funding through a partnership between both the provincial and federal government.

In a statement, the UWI said partners developed a three-day virtual programme which took place on August 15 and 22 and concludes on August 29, for adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago between the ages of 14 and 19.

This programme forms part of the UN’s 75th anniversary global dialogues on SDGs. It aims to introduce the participants to their roles in achieving SDGs and create a forum for helping them generate and present ideas for practical projects to improve their communities.

The Youth Awareness Programme commenced on August 15 with presentations on ‘Localising Sustainable Development Goals’. Students from The UWI, St Augustine campus and other educational institutions across the country participated and developed their own SDG projects in small groups via a virtual platform.

At the second session on August 22, the students presented their projects to a panel of representatives from the UN in Trinidad and Tobago, DEF and The UWI.

The UWI said a virtual awards ceremony is scheduled for the final day of the programme on August 29. The most innovative project proposal will be announced and funded by the UN for implementation.

Commenting on The UWI’s participation on the initiative, Dr Stacy Richards-Kennedy who heads the University’s regional Office of Global Partnerships and Sustainable Futures stated:

'Following our launch of the UWI SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign in 2017 and our ongoing SDG initiatives, we remain energised as a leading partner on programmes such as these. It is through continuous youth engagement and expansion of networks of youth advocates that we will be able to increase awareness and strengthen capacity to implement sustainable development projects. As a regional university, we remain committed to supporting the Caribbean in working towards the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.'

'The UWI’s involvement in this SDG Youth Awareness Programme is just one example of the University’s support for youth engagement on the global 2030 sustainable development agenda.'

The UWI said in 2017 it spearheaded a regional SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign funded by UNDP, co-organised the Caribbean Action 2030 Regional Conference and Youth Forum at its Mona Campus in Jamaica, launched a digital photo competition “Through the lens of Caribbean Youth” and produced a series of short films entitled “Youth Action on the SDGs” in collaboration with Sustain T&T.

In July this year, The UWI joined forces with UNICEF and the Ashley Lashley Foundation in Barbados to host the Global Youth Network Summit on Climate Change and Health, which included a Declaration signed by Caribbean students in support of climate action.

Several SDG youth engagement activities have also been led by The UWI Youth Development Programme and UWI-STAT Ambassadors. In 2020, The UWI also ranked among the top 200 universities in the Times Higher Education’s Impact Rankings for its research, outreach and stewardship of the SDGs.

The regional University’s partnership with Decibel Arts and Entertainment Festival was born earlier this year, based on DEF’s mission to work with youth and preparing them for the future. DEF has also stepped up to support UWI students across the region who have been functioning in difficult social circumstances because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this most recent collaboration, The UWI and DEF have realised another shared objective of empowering young people to make tangible contributions to help the region achieve the SDGs.

Preparations are underway for a new mental health nurse to assist SDG OPP officers.

The nurse will be trained in mental health issues and will provide relief for officers so they can spend more time patrolling the streets.

“The reason to have the nurse there is so they can send the person with the right referrals and keep in touch with the community,” said SDG Coun. Bryan McGillis, who also sits on the SDG police services board. “Anybody that has any mental health issues, they’re going to keep in touch with them.”

The nurse will also be in contact with the families for patient feedback and follow up on medications provided to the patient. In the event there is a mental health issue, the nurse will respond to calls with the police.

“Many patients have poor experiences over the years in the hospital because they think the result is them being admitted and formed, which in most cases does not have to be,” said McGillis. “It’s a fear to them. If they go to the hospital and get the mental health nurse, they can go to the proper resources immediately.”","Article contentPreparations are underway for a new mental health nurse to assist SDG OPP officers.

The guide titled, ‘Gender norms and women in politics: Evaluating progress and identifying challenges on the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform,’ published in August 2020, is authored by Rachel George with Emma Samman, Katie Washington, and Alina Ojha.

The 1995 Beijing Declaration includes a goal to ensure women’s equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision-making. The ALIGN publication finds that women are increasingly exercising their right to political participation, but many still “find their way barred by the gender norms that see politics as a masculine space.” The guide highlights how, 25 years after adoption of the Beijing Declaration, gender norms still influence women’s parliamentary representation, women’s experiences running for and standing in leadership positions, and women’s engagement in civic action and social movements.

The authors determine that “across many cultures and societies, it is increasingly common for young generations of girls to aspire to political leadership.” This is due to rising access to and achievement in education and economic shifts, as well as women’s movements and women leaders of wider social movements, among other factors. At the same time, the authors report, coalitions and movements that don’t support gender equality also are growing in power and influence.

The guide also presents statistics showing trends in women’s political participation. Women’s parliamentary representation has doubled since 1995, from 12% to 25% worldwide. The number of countries with more than 30% female representation has risen from 5 to 51. At the level of heads of state and government, the authors report that women account for just 10% of leaders worldwide – but in 1966, no country had ever had an elected female leader. Sub-nationally, fewer than 5% of the world’s mayors are women, and women account for just 20% of local councilors worldwide on average, although data on these trends are limited.

ALIGN is a digital platform and programme of work aiming to create a global community of researchers and thought leaders committed to gender justice and equality. The initiative provides research, insights, and grants to examine and change discriminatory gender norms. ALIGN is currently led by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Government of Canada.

On 1 October 2020, the UN General Assembly will convene a high-level meeting to commemorate Beijing+25. The high-level meeting on 1 October will focus on ‘Accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.’ The concept note indicates the plenary segment will focus on concrete actions to achieve this goal.

249,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/fifth-global-biodiversity-outlook-focuses-on-eight-transition-areas/,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook Focuses on Eight Transition Areas,"The flagship publication of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) reports progress on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health.

The CBD Secretariat launched the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) on 15 September 2020, during the first of four days of ‘Special Virtual Sessions’ taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to the eight transition areas, GBO-5 reviews progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) in October 2010, and were set for the 2011-2020 period. GBO-5 draws on indicators, research studies, and assessments, including the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as national reports submitted to the CBD.

Conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions, among other areas of progress reported in GBO-5.

The report highlights ten areas in which progress can be viewed:

almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems;

the rate of deforestation has fallen globally by about one-third compared to the previous decade;

where good fisheries management policies have been introduced, the abundance of marine fish stocks has been maintained or rebuilt;

an increasing number of successful cases of eradication of invasive alien species from islands has been reported;

a significant expansion of protected area has been reported;

conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions;

the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization has come into force and is fully operational in at least 87 countries and internationally;

national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) have been updated in line with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by 170 countries (85% of CBD Parties);

there has been an increase in the available data and information on biodiversity; and

financial resources available for biodiversity through international flows have doubled.

The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” that draws on efforts related to: enhanced conservation and restoration of ecosystems; climate change mitigation; action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation; more sustainable production of goods and services; and reduced consumption and waste.

Also highlighted during the launch event was the second edition of the Local Biodiversity Outlooks (LBO-2). LBO-2 focuses on local biodiversity and stories of resilience among indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). It proposes six transition areas aligned with GBO-5:

Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being;

Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure of IPLCs;

Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development;

Incentives and financial transitions towards rewarding effective culturebased solutions;

Economic transitions towards sustainable use and diverse local economies; and

Food transitions towards revitalising indigenous and local food systems.

Joji Carino, Forest Peoples Programme, launched the report as part of the 15 September event. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, Carino said IPLCs are underrepresented in national strategies and action plans, “despite agreement that putting culture and the rights of IPLCs at the heart of biodiversity strategy can bring about positive outcomes.”

The event also launched a review of progress towards the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020.

250,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-economic-social-impacts-of-covid-19/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UNCTAD Report Details Economic, Social Impacts of COVID-19","A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretariat finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to “reverse much of the economic and social progress already made” towards SDG achievement. However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Summit, Agnes Kalibata, said five “action tracks” are at the center of the preparatory process.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who organized the briefing on 4 September 2020, said transforming food systems will be central to achieving the SDGs. The Summit will be a “foundational element” of the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs by 2030, Mohammed noted, citing the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report’s finding that food systems and nutrition are key entry points for getting the world on a more sustainable trajectory.

The five action tracks will develop “exemplary, game-changing, and systemic solutions.”

Kalibata said the Summit aims to raise public discourse around food systems and what we can do differently. More specifically, it will have five interconnected objectives:

Ensure access to safe, nutritious food for all; Shift to sustainable consumption patterns by reducing waste and creating demand for healthy diets; Boost “nature-positive production,” entailing reduced emissions and energy usage and protection of ecosystems; Advance equitable livelihoods, including raising incomes and promoting decent work; and Build resilience to vulnerabilities and shocks.

An action track is being established in each of these areas. The action tracks will be charged with developing “exemplary, game-changing, and systemic solutions.” Each track will include participants from the global north, the global south, and youth. The organizers are seeking expressions of interest in the five action tracks by 30 September 2020.

To make the event “both a people’s summit and a solutions summit,” several additional work streams and support structures are being established. As announced in June 2020, these include:

Advisory Committee chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General, to provide strategic guidance; includes two Member States from each region, as well as senior officials of relevant UN agencies and other international organizations, and individual experts (farmers, indigenous peoples, civil society, researchers, academics, youth, business leaders);

Scientific Group to ensure that the science underpinning the Summit and its outcomes is robust, broad, and independent, and provide analyses of trade-offs faced by food system actors;

Champions Network to mobilize a large, diverse group of stakeholders to call for transformation of the world’s food systems, and facilitate coordinated action

UN Task Force to ensure the Summit builds on knowledge of entire UN system

Initial meetings have taken place for the Advisory Committee, the Scientific Group, and the UN Task Force. The Champions Network will be opened on World Food Day 2020.

National dialogues on food systems also will take place ahead of the Summit.

The Summit is currently anticipated to convene in September or October 2021. According to the organizers, the “best case scenario” is gathering Heads of State and leaders from around the world, but the Summit should also be prepared to take place virtually or in a hybrid format with one or more small, in-person events.

The Food Systems Summit is expected to result in a high-level call to action and a system of follow-up and review. It is being convened by the UN Secretary-General. The Rome-based UN agencies (World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and International Fund for Agricultural Development) are playing a leading role in organizing the event and the preparatory roadmap.

Examples from around the world highlight the use of data to make better decisions, such as to find the best locations to resettled endangered rhinos in Kenya.

The report titled, ‘A Global Movement for Better Data and Better Lives: Five years of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, 2015-2020,’ reflects on the Partnership’s five years of learning and shares experience on how to build a better data system. The authors highlight five key lessons:

“Good data takes time”: time is needed to build relationships, change institutions, and learn; commitments must be long-term, and planning and budgeting need to be based on a long-term perspective embedded within a supportive institutional framework;

“Progress depends on people”: understanding and trust are key to good partnerships; building common understanding and agreeing on common goals can help mediate between different organizations;

“Politics drives technical change” and political support is key to achieve sustainable change at scale; South-South cooperation should be used as a lever for change;

“Values count”: equity and inclusivity are critical to data progress; data should be inclusive in form and function, and new capacities and skills are needed to respond to unforeseen phenomena and complex data issues; and

“Systems not silos”: openness and interoperability strengthen data systems and increase impact; data has the most value when it can be combined and used in different systems; open data, platforms, and tools make systems fair and flexible, facilitating innovation and spreading knowledge.

The report shares how partnerships across government, the private sector, civil society, and academia are using data for better decisions, based on the principles of local ownership and sustainability. Examples include:

In Kenya, wildlife conservation groups are leveraging improved data and technology to find the best locations for resettling endangered rhinos;

In Colombia and Paraguay, government partners have developed new methods of SDG monitoring to allow countries around the world to better measure progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

In Nigeria, the government created a COVID-19 dashboard that combines data from government agencies to track COVID-19 cases and health center availability;

In Sierra Leone, the government is using data and technology to better protect its mangrove forests; and

In Senegal, farmers can get prices for their crops more quickly at harvest time.

Similarly, the report showcases how better data are improving the lives of the poorest people in the world. The statistics office in Colombia is accounting for gender, disability, ethnicity, and life cycle to create a fuller understanding of people’s needs in data. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center published the first global estimate of the number of internally displaced women and children. In Zanzibar, the government is using data to understand gendered dimensions of crime and migration.

Among the report’s highlights of how the Partnership has contributed to systemic changes, responsible data sharing and innovation, in 2018, it produced a guide on data interoperability that draws on learning from over 100 partners and is informing practice in nine countries. To increase funding for data, the Partnership collaborated with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, and several governments to launch the 50×2030 initiative in 2018, which aims to bridge the global agricultural data gap by transforming country data systems across 50 countries by 2030.

Looking forward, the report notes that the Partnership aims to build regional and national partnerships to strengthen systems, build capacity, and learn what works to ensure that better data can be used to improve decisions and scale up successful experiments.

The Global Partnership, a network of 260 partners from 59 countries across 111 cities, launched the report at a global town hall event on 25 September 2020 to mark its fifth anniversary. Also on 25 September, Global Goals Day, the Partnership marked the fifth anniversary of the SDGs’ adoption in 2015 with a focus on “factivism,” drawing attention to the action needed by everyone to deliver the Goals by 2030.

Participants adopted a Declaration that recognizes multilateralism as a necessity for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, and that implementation of the 2030 Agenda is necessary for survival.

The official commemoration of UN75, which took place at a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government joining virtually, focused on the theme of ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’

The UN Secretary-General warned that the world faces a “surplus of multilateral challenges, and a deficit of multilateral solutions.” In January 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres had launched the UN75 initiative as “the world’s largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.” The UN crowdsourced views on its future priorities and solutions from the global public, through a survey of over a million people in all 193 UN Member States; more than 1,000 dialogues in 82 countries across the world; and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.

Improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty.

Presenting findings from the consultation during the high-level commemoration, Guterres noted they demonstrate the public appetite for increased global solidarity, and emphasized that improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty. Guterres identified gender inequality as the “greatest single challenge to human rights around the world” and expressed concern about the “climate calamity”, rising poverty and nuclear weapons.

UN Security Council President Abdou Abarry said the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exacerbated challenges such as the illicit arms trade, human trafficking, and international terrorism. He also noted that there is no other global organization with the legitimacy and convening power of the UN.

The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Munir Akram said his presidency will focus on mobilizing finance to address the pandemic, achieve the SDGs, avoid the climate catastrophe, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. Four youth leaders called for concrete actions to support those who are left behind and to tackle climate change, among other issues.

President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera, for the least developed countries (LDCs), listed five focus areas for the UN: strengthening multilateralism, including through UN reforms; addressing inequality, including the gender gap and digital divide; financing to implement the 2030 Agenda; pursuing holistic approaches to reflect the singular objective of all SDGs; and promoting a people-centric approach. President of the European Council (EC) Charles Michel, for the EU, underscored the need for COVID-19 treatment to be accessible to all. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), called for revitalizing the UN General Assembly and reforming the Security Council. Many other speakers expressed support for UN reform, and emphasized the importance of multilateralism in COVID-19 recovery and progress towards a more equitable, sustainable world for all.

President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa noted that climate change, environmental disasters, transnational crimes, and migration can be solved only through multilateralism. Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Löfven announced that Sweden will host a conference in Stockholm in 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment.

During the event, Heads of State and Government adopted a ‘Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the UN (A/75/L.1).’ In the Declaration, Member States recognize that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago has not yet been realized: it is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics; people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge and safety; the LDCs are falling behind; and complete decolonization has not been achieved. Further, Member States recognize that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agree that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

In the Declaration, Member States resolve to:

Leave no one behind, with particular attention to people in vulnerable situations.

Protect our planet, including through transformative measures, and by building back better and greener.

Promote peace and prevent conflicts, including through preventive diplomacy and mediation, and respect for international humanitarian law.

Abide by international law and ensure justice.

Place women and girls at the center, and accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women’s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains.

Build trust, by addressing growing inequalities within and among countries, and addressing root causes of inequalities, including violence, human rights abuses, corruption, marginalization, discrimination in all its forms, poverty, and exclusion, as well as lack of education and employment.

Improve digital cooperation and ensure safe and affordable digital access for all.

Upgrade the UN, including by supporting ongoing reform by the UN Secretary-General. They also commit to instill new life in the discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council, continue the work to revitalize the UNGA, and strengthen ECOSOC.

Ensure sustainable financing, including by paying assessed contributions in full and on time; and through the full and timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD).

Boost partnerships, by engaging with all stakeholders including regional and sub-regional organizations, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians.

Listen to, and work with, youth.

Be prepared, including by improving the global crisis prevention and response systems; learning and sharing experiences and information to reduce risks and make our systems more resilient; and accelerating development, production, as well as equitable and affordable global access to new vaccines, medicines, and medical equipment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected modalities of delivery of capacity-development activities around the world. Like many other organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) had to quickly adapt face-to-face training contents to the online environment. Some critical components of capacity-development activities needed to be carefully evaluated in order to identify the right format, volume, and overall feasibility of delivery considering the fact that learning would be conducted virtually and across various time zones.

FAO is the custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators and a contributing agency for a further five. In this capacity, FAO is supporting countries’ efforts in monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. FAO’s Land and Water Division is leading the work related to indicators 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency over time) and 6.4.2 (Level of water stress), using the AQUASTAT database for data collection and management.

One project, ‘Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 – IMI-SDG6,’ carried out by FAO, along with other UN agencies, and coordinated by UN-Water. Together with data collection and reporting, its main objective at this stage is to support countries to increase their technical and institutional capacity for the monitoring of the indicators related to Goal 6 targets (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all).

In the pre-COVID-19 era, face-to-face regional and national workshops and trainings represented the key modality for the delivery of capacity-development support under the project, due to the high level of interactivity, the possibility of direct exchange of experience and knowledge, as well as the networking potential among participants. Distant learning tools were then used to complement face-to-face interaction and to offer support in situations when a physical meeting was not possible. In most cases however, distance learning tools were used to target single individuals or small groups of participants.

The global pandemic, which caused the cancellation of scheduled face-to-face activities, served as a catalyst, stimulating and accelerating a global shift towards an effective and robust distance learning highway. What made this possible is not only organizational adaptation to the new conditions but also the ability and willingness of the audiences worldwide to take advantage of distance learning tools, overcoming their limitations.

At FAO, we had to change our mindset, and design and implement online capacity-development activities having such a level of scale and degree of interactivity as to be able to continue supporting countries’ SDG monitoring efforts. As a result, in June and July 2020, we organized two five-week regional interactive online courses on monitoring SDG indicators on sustainable water use: one, in Spanish, for Latin American countries and the other, in English, for countries in South and South-East Asia. More than 200 water monitoring and management professionals and statisticians from 33 countries participated in the courses, offering positive feedback on the module.

The courses consisted of five sessions, each lasting 100 minutes. The sessions included presentations by FAO staff, complemented by videos, polls, and question-and-answer exercises using the chat box of the teleconference platform. Each session concluded by highlighting recommended readings and exercises in preparation for the following session.

This delivery modality enabled us to reach many more relevant country staff than through in-person workshops, and strengthened the interaction within country teams as most of the exercises had been designed as country group work. We also noted significantly higher follow-up interaction between the participants and the FAO team than with face-to-face activities, most likely due to the fact that the courses had been conceived as online modules from the outset.

This experience has revealed that it is crucial to rethink the nature of capacity-development interventions, both from the side of the provider and the recipient. While face-to-face capacity-building activities remain an important element for IMI-SDG6 project, and will resume as soon as possible, interactive online courses have proven to be not just an emergency substitute but also an excellent complementary modality for capacity-development products’ delivery. The two modalities can be used to deliver different kinds of support: in-person activities are crucial in establishing relationships and in facilitating exchange of experience, while remote learning can be effective for addressing more technical subjects and for increasing the outreach and potential impact of our interventions. The online delivery modality will remain an integral component of the FAO IMI-SDG6 capacity-development portfolio, enriching the set of tools that we can put at our partners’ disposal.

FAO looks forward to using new tools to develop new capacities for reaching beneficiaries around the world to work together towards the achievement of the SDGs with an open mind, constantly adapting to the changing global conditions.

The report titled, ‘Valuing Nature Conservation: A Methodology for Quantifying the Benefits of Protecting the Planet’s Natural Capital,’ was issued on 22 September 2020, ahead of the first UN Biodiversity Summit.

The report highlights the global economy’s dependence on natural capital, and argues that “analysis of opportunities to expand nature conservation can help determine where natural capital could have the biggest impact on climate, jobs, and health.”

Noting scientists’ call for the permanent conservation of at least 30% of the planet’s surface by 2030, the report identifies the need for “rigorous data-driven analysis” to enable decision makers to design conservation efforts that would also capture benefits and manage risks, and to make informed trade-offs. In an effort to contribute to such efforts, the report provides a methodology to evaluate the full spectrum of co-benefits from nature conservation.

The report’s authors used “advanced geospatial analytics to create and evaluate alternative nature conservation scenarios and explore trade-offs.” The authors divided the planet’s surfaces into “pixels” (land areas of 5 kilometers by 5 kilometers and marine areas of 30 kilometers by 30 kilometers), reaching a total of around 6 million pixels. They overlaid the resultant “global map with thousands of spatial data layers” covering variables such as biodiversity, carbon stock, and human footprint “to establish a baseline for nature conservation and define six alternative scenarios to maximize the value from expanded conservation.” The authors then assessed the impact of expanded conservation on climate change, jobs, gross domestic product (GDP), zoonotic disease risk, and biodiversity, calculating the additional operating costs of conservation.

The report finds that, depending on the conservation scenario, doubling the amount of conserved land and national waters could require an additional USD 20 billion to 45 billion a year. In more than half of the conservation areas identified, it notes, “the economic benefits from ecotourism and sustainable fishing alone could outweigh these costs by at least three times.” At the same time, the benefits of doubling the amount of conserved land and national waters could include:

annual reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by 0.9 gigatons to 2.6 gigatons;

creation of 400,000 to 650,000 jobs in conservation management fields, along with generating or safeguarding USD 300 billion to 500 billion in GDP and 30 million jobs in ecotourism and sustainable fishing; and

lowering the risk of new zoonotic diseases.

The authors acknowledge that expanding the conservation of natural capital at the local and global levels would require action by multiple stakeholders. They offer the following recommendations:

Private-sector organizations would benefit from understanding the growing risks to supply chains and operating assets from the loss of natural capital, which could also help them identify nature conservation investments to address these risks.

It’s clear that we need urgent, transformative change to tackle the global nature crisis. In many cases, we already know the solutions. How to stop terrestrial biodiversity loss from habitat conversion is one such case, and it has implications for the entire SDG framework.

Last week, the UN Convention for Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 reported that of the 20 Aichi targets agreed in 2010, only six are being “partially achieved” by their 2020 deadline. The CBD warns that despite encouraging progress in several areas, the natural world is suffering badly and getting worse. Launched in the same week, WWF’s Living Planet Report found that the population sizes of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles have seen an average drop of 68% since 1970.

How can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while feeding a growing population?

The good news is that the scientific community has made great progress in defining the problem over the past decade; we now have a clear and robust evidence base showing the urgency of changing course. There has also been massive progress in scientifically defining what needs to be done. A prime example of this is our knowledge of how to halt and reverse terrestrial biodiversity loss from land use change.

A third recent study, published in Nature on 10 September, shows the possibility of halting and reversing terrestrial biodiversity loss caused by land use change.

Six Actions to Halt and Recover from Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss

The new study was led by David Leclere of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and involved 58 experts from across 46 institutions including the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). It projects that without further efforts to tackle habitat loss and degradation, global biodiversity decline will continue at a rate close to or greater than that for 1970-2010. Land use change, also known as habitat conversion, is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land. The researchers used ground-breaking modelling and newly developed scenarios to identify six actions needed to stop such losses. These are:

Sustainable increases in crop yields;

Trade increases in agricultural goods with reduced trade barriers;

Reducing the waste of agricultural goods from field to fork by 50%;

Cutting the share of animal calories in human diets by 50% except in regions in which the share of animal products in diets is already estimated to be low (the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and other Pacific Islands);

Increasing Protected Area extent to 40% terrestrial coverage, covering important sites for biodiversity and with improved management; and

Increasing restoration (reaching about 8% of terrestrial areas by 2050) and landscape-level conservation planning that balances production and conservation objectives on all managed land.

By combining the six actions listed above in an integrated strategy, modelling shows that it is possible to avoid more than two thirds of future terrestrial biodiversity losses caused by land use change.

Protecting SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 15 (Life on Land) at the Same Time

The authors of the study considered seven different scenarios to explore whether we could achieve this without undermining other SDGs. In particular, how can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while also feeding a growing population?

Without transformation of the food system, bold conservation efforts could conflict with future food provision by raising food prices. The conservation efforts alone would also not be enough to stop the losses by 2050. In order to achieve this and reduce potential negative impacts on food security, conservation efforts should be combined with simultaneous transformation of food systems, as well as wider action on other drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and biological invasions.

Such transformative change in food and land use systems would also have valuable co-benefits that contribute to other SDGs, such as SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing).

Implications for International Policy

This is the first time that the key combined actions needed to stop and reverse biodiversity loss on land have been identified and backed by robust futures modelling. This research sets out clear and ambitious actions for governments, businesses, and consumers to take on board.

The next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2021 (COP 15) is expected to agree a set of new international goals and targets as part of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework to take us through to 2050. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework will be a critical opportunity to stop biodiversity loss and ensure that people continue to benefit from biodiversity into the future. But for this framework to be effective, it must incorporate bold conservation and restoration efforts as well as food system transformation. Together these can help to tackle the drivers of terrestrial biodiversity loss.

However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session.

On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”

In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.

Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.

We are facing a planetary emergency – a nature crisis, a climate crisis, and an inequality crisis all at once. Yet the world’s level of ambition to tackle our nature crisis to date has been lackluster, with a recent report highlighting that the world has failed to achieve most of the global biodiversity ambitions that the world agreed to in 2010, as part of a decade-long strategic plan for nature.

The result of low levels of leadership and political will in implementing the global plan, along with ever increasing threats to ecosystem and biodiversity coming from economic sectors, has been predictable – a recent report on the state of biodiversity found that the world has lost 68% of all wildlife populations since 1970.

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global diversity framework requires eliminating “negative money.”

To fully respond to this emergency, we need bold ambition, commitment, and action at all levels, from local to global, and across different sectors and constituencies. We need a multi-pronged “whole-of-society approach” to redefine our relationship with nature towards constructing a nature-based planetary safety net.

This article provides updates on progress in five areas.

Committing to Financing Nature

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework will require a significant increase in financial resources from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue.

It also requires eliminating “negative money.” For example, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year as agriculture, fisheries, and other subsidies to incentivize activities that degrade or destroy nature. All told, the finance gap for protecting 30% of the planet is about USD700 billion a year. However, a new report shows that this finance gap is not as large as it seems – it accounts for just under one percent of global GDP, and is a tiny fraction of the USD5.2 trillion we spend in fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the benefits of protecting nature outweigh the costs by at least 5:1. The best investment ever!

Reversing Biodiversity Loss by 2030 Through Global Commitment

Global, national, and sub-national leaders can no longer ignore our planetary crisis. Indeed, more than 1,700 jurisdictions have already declared a climate emergency. Now world leaders have begun to mobilize around a pledge for nature. More than 50 heads of state have already signed a pledge for nature, and 30 more are in the process of endorsing.

Among other statements, this pledge includes a recognition of the nature crisis, and calls for an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. To accompany this commitment, the Club of Rome has developed a concrete plan to emerge from our emergency.

Creating a Nature-Based Planetary Safety Net

The year 2021 will see the agreement by the world’s governments on a bold biodiversity framework through 2030, with an eye towards a planet in harmony with nature by 2050.

Building on the indivisible relation between the wellbeing of people and the wellbeing of nature, the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) will begin by looking back to the past decade, identifying reasons for hope in national and local action on biodiversity. COP 15 will then look forward, identifying key elements required for achieving success, including bold political will, coherent and aligned government policies, integration and alignment of a wide range of economic sectors, adequate resource mobilization, and decisive action, among others.

Greening Covid-19 Recovery Efforts and Creating Green New Deals

COVID-19 has taught us that business as usual is no longer an option. This crisis highlights the socio-economic threats and costs posed by our planetary emergency, and offers an opportunity to accelerate the transition to more inclusive, greener, and more resilient economies. Decisions made now on how to stimulate growth, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and prevent the next pandemic will determine the future health, well-being, and stability of both people and the planet.

To take action, countries can:

“green” their stimulus packages and longer-term national recovery plans;

promote green public work programs;

redirect harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies;

integrate nature-climate concerns into agriculture, water resources, forestry, tourism, industry, mining, energy, and infrastructure; and

promote sustainable public/private finance and investments.

Mapping Nature for People and Planet

More than 2,200 satellites circle the earth, enabling humanity to monitor the planet in ways never imagined possible. Enabled by the UNDP-led UN Biodiversity Lab, governments are beginning to use spatial data from these satellites, and combine these datasets with local and national data to generate new insight.

Supported by UNDP, and with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Government of Sweden, and One Earth, five governments – Uganda, Costa Rica, Peru, Kazakhstan and Colombia – have initiated a new process, called Mapping Nature For People and Planet: Essential Life Support Areas. Using satellite data, local and national data, and the principles of systematic conservation planning, these governments are able to pinpoint where actions on nature protection, restoration, and sustainable management will help them meet their nature-dependent national development goals, especially for water, food, climate, livelihoods, safety, and biodiversity. As Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the new head of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Francis Ogwal, co-chair of the working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, explain in a recent blog, such maps are an essential component for planning, implementing, and monitoring bold ambition and action on nature.

2020 was supposed to be a ‘Super Year for Nature.’ But even though all major biodiversity events have been postponed or cancelled, the recent gains in these five trends give us reasons for hope. To learn more, and for a dose of hope, visit www.NatureForLifeHub.org.

The bond features two eligibility criteria: a geospatial criterion that prioritizes vulnerable populations; and a governance criterion linked to the involvement of a UN organization. The bond is also the first to use the SDGs as an entry point, not only in ex-post mapping, according to the investment bank that helped Mexico design the bond.

Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit announced the initiative on 15 September 2020 as part of its sustainable financing program and the first part of a recurring finance tool. It is a seven-year bond for USD 890 million to be used through a “SDG localized finance” approach.

Natixis indicates that Mexico’s approach to a sovereign SDG bond could be duplicated by other countries, but “requires a strong bedrock” in three areas: institutional capacity, budget mapping against the SDGs, and sub-national data to inform the geospatial eligibility criterion.

On the geospatial eligibility, Natixis reports that the SDG bond issuances will finance projects located in 1,345 municipalities in Mexico selected because of illiteracy rates, school attendance rates, level of health services deprivation, lack of toilets, drainage or piped water in houses, absence of electricity access or basic equipment such as refrigerators. The geospatial eligibility is based on “very granular open data.”

On the governance eligibility, Natixis explains that the main governance innovation in the bond framework is the involvement of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which had worked with Mexico on its SDG budget mapping.

In UNDP’s press release about the bond, Administrator Achim Steiner expressed hope that other countries will soon follow Mexico by establishing their own sovereign SDG bonds. [SDG Sovereign Bond Framework]","The Federal Government of Mexico issued a Sovereign SDG Bond, the first country to do so.

A group of technology and finance leaders, development experts, and government and UN officials launched a report on using financial technology and digital finance to advance sustainable development, focusing on empowering citizens to better align their money with their needs.

The Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs was established by the UN Secretary-General in 2018, as part of a four-year strategy on financing the 2030 Agenda, and as a complement to the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. The 17-member Task Force is led by Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, and Maria Ramos, ABSA Group’s former CEO.

Citizens need to have a say over where their pension contributions go.

The Task Force launched its report titled, ‘People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future,’ on 26 August 2020. It lays out a five-part Action Agenda to “empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs,” which are collectively expressed in the SDGs. These five catalysts are:

Aligning the “vast pools” flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs;

Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance;

Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance;

Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs; and

Accelerating “lifeblood financing” for small and medium-sized businesses.

At the virtual launch of the report, Steiner said “the Task Force was keen to bring back the notion that the citizen is at the center of the economy. Citizens need greater transparency, and to have a say over where their pension contributions go,” as well as to see public benefits from their contributions. He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the popularity and adoption of digital tools, such as digital cash transfers, connecting schools to broadband, and remotely connecting people to government and parliamentary processes. In addition, the widespread adoption of smartphones enables people to manage their finances more actively. He suggested that the financial system could be remodeled to reflect the role of citizens’ pensions and savings in global investment flows.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that among all of the Task Force’s findings, “what has truly drawn my attention is the conclusion that digitalization will make a difference by giving people greater control over how global finance — their own money — is used,” and that it increases the ability to hold financial institutions accountable. He endorsed the Task Force’s “vision of citizen-centric finance.”

Citing the “dislocation” between the commitment to the SDGs and decision-making around public financing, Guterres said the report provides a set of ideas to “deliver financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, by shifting the center of gravity of the financial system towards empowered citizens.” [Publication: People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future] [Task Force website] [UN News story] [UNDP press release]","A widespread shift to digital finance could provide the means to meet the costs of achieving the 2030 Agenda, according to a UN task force.

While preparations are underway for this year’s UN General Assembly and the UN 75th anniversary, the world is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all areas of life.

Cooperation and partnerships on the local, national, and international levels, as called for in Sustainable Development Goal 17, are more vital than ever. Many multilateral bodies have yet to show real leadership when it comes to this. The pandemic has exposed their internal rifts and animosities.

In the meantime, civil society, academia, and citizens are collaborating to help humanity soften the blow of the most significant event in recent history. COVID-19 has impacted the world as a whole, but some populations are more affected than others. That is why voices from developing countries in the Global South are critical at this moment.

Like most organizations, the Southern Voice network has had to adapt. Luckily, our 51 member think tanks across Africa, Asia, and Latin America generated timely analysis of how the new coronavirus was affecting their countries. At the network’s Secretariat, we felt that researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders outside the network, should be able to access this knowledge. Hence, we created a sort of “one-stop-shop” on information on COVID-19 in the Global South. At first just a page on our website, it has now evolved into a full-fledged digital knowledge hub.

The digital hub shows how each SDG is being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Southern Voice’s researchers from 25 countries are analyzing the impact the pandemic is having in areas such as the economy, gender equality, education, and the digital divide. The user has direct access to information on how each region (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) is dealing with the virus. In addition, information can be searched at the global level.

The hub also shows how each SDG is being affected by the pandemic. For example, the gulf between the “digital have and have nots” became even more evident this year. For the majority of people in the Global South, working or learning from home via virtual means is not an option. This fact is further widening the poverty gap, with a direct impact on SDG 1 (no poverty) and various other Goals.

The next generation of humans will be affected more than any other by the aftershock of COVID-19, in particular through impacts on education. Achieving SDG 4 (quality education) is critical to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

As a “bonus”, Southern Voice is also making available a database of experts from across the Global South. Various Southern Voice research centers are now teaming up to offer concrete solutions and recommendations to the crisis. Updates on their work will be available in the hub.

We hope that the database will be used for conference organizers and media outlets, but also by policymakers seeking advice on how to “build back better” with the help of fact-based, timely analysis.

Spaces like this hub represent a glimmer of hope among all the bad news this year. A concrete example of cooperation and partnership, it proves that humanity can come together. It shows that we can tackle a problem that affects us all, much in the spirit of the upcoming Declaration on the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary. In it, the UN Heads of State and Government pledge to “boost partnerships” across the whole of society to “ensure an effective response to our common challenges.” To achieve that, new and diverse voices from all walks of life and cultures are pivotal. For this reason, Southern Voice members are working tirelessly not only to understand the effects of the pandemic, but also to promote hands-on solutions for the short and long-term.

We hope that the COVID-19 in the Global South knowledge hub becomes a go-to place for analysis and recommendations. It is a testament to the cooperative work of hundreds of researchers across the Global South and beyond.

2020 can go down in history as an apocalyptic year. Or it can be a time in which we finally join hands to make SDG 17 a reality, through a more robust multilateral system.

The launches took place as part of an event on ‘American Leadership in Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.’

The side event was organized by The Brookings Institution and the UN Foundation. It convened virtually on 16 September 2020. John Allen, President of The Brookings Institution, welcomed participants and announced that Brookings is creating a new Center for Sustainable Development.

To set the stage for the event, Fatimata Cham, youth poet and activist, performed a poem that concluded with the assurance, and challenge, that “Hope is the sound of your own voice.”

The multiple challenges we are facing demonstrate the importance of local leaders.

Anthony Pipa, The Brookings Institution, highlighted that the 2030 Agenda is an agenda for all sectors, not just national governments. He said the multiple challenges we are currently facing demonstrate how important local leaders are.

Representatives of US cities and companies discussed their work as “engines of action” to implement the SDGs. From the City of Los Angeles, California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said “Leadership is defined by how we react to things that we did not expect to happen,” and noted that the SDG framework helps to make our choices clear when considering policy options. He called attention to LA’s online dashboard to track its progress, and reported that LA is launching an SDGs activities index to help LA residents find new partners.

For the City of New York, Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner for International Affairs, recalled that in 2018, New York launched a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Since then, over 200 local governments and cities have committed to producing VLRs, she reported.

Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon and the Verizon Foundation, discussed her company’s work in relation to SDG 4 (quality education), especially to address inequalities in connectivity. Yvette Pearson, George R. Brown School of Engineering, Rice University, highlighted the need to incorporate societal input into the design of solutions. She said this requires adjustments in engineering curricula.

Launching the first Voluntary University Review (VUR), James Garrett Jr., Carnegie Mellon University, expressed hope that more universities will follow CMU’s lead. He emphasized the importance of dialogues – with local government, NGOs, and the private sector – when creating the VUR.

Governor of Hawai’i David Ige launched the first statewide review of the SDGs (voluntary state review, or VSR). He reviewed the dialogue process used to develop the VSR, with state and local governments, community organizations, and the private sector working to identify shared goals. He said the state will measure progress through a data dashboard to hold itself accountable.

Ige noted that the SDGs provide a common language “to align our canoes in the same direction.” Hawai’i’s US Senator Brian Schatz said policies need to “paint a picture and paint me in it” – they need to work for people, and the SDG framework ensures that policies work for everyone.

Dustin Liu, UNA-USA Youth Observer to the UN, reiterated the discussion’s emphasis on the role of dialogue with multiple stakeholders by calling for including youth voices at all levels of decision making.

Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO, UN Foundation, said it is inspiring to see how groups are using the SDGs. She shared her experience as a government representative who helped negotiate the SDGs five years ago, saying those negotiators did not expect them to resonate across so many groups. Multiple groups have embraced the Goals because, as Cousens emphasized, they are universal, interconnected, and about real challenges faced by people around the world.

The Alliance was the focus of a high-level virtual meeting on trends, options, and strategies for eliminating poverty.

Thirty-nine countries are listed as members of the Alliance. The Alliance will be led by Interim Coordinator Samson Itegboje, Permanent Mission of Nigeria. Itegboje said poverty is “the number one goal among the SDGs” and the most topical issue facing the global community apart from the impacts of COVID-19.

SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met.

Itegboje said the Alliance must “chart a new course” for poverty eradication. To be effective, he said, a strategy to eradicate poverty must reflect its multi-dimensional nature, incorporating economic, social, cultural and political dimensions.

Olivier Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, said the Alliance is extremely important for three reasons:

The number of people in extreme poverty is still unacceptably high, and this is not a result of natural disasters but of inappropriate policy choices. He called for a policy-oriented study on why people are still poor.

Other stakeholders must be involved in improving global governance practices. He called for collaboration on trade, investment, international property rights, and other interventions critical to the realization of SDG 1 (no poverty).

Developing countries need support to establish social protection floors, due to their current budget deficits.

Schutter informed participants of a process underway to establish a Global Fund for Social Protection. This will aim to coordinate various countries’ efforts to strengthen social protection. It would also work to mobilize resources to support developing countries in bridging financing gaps and establishing social protection floors. Finally, the Fund would also provide a reinsurance facility, allowing poor countries to protect themselves against shocks and thus maintain the functioning of social protection systems.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Mona Juul, said women must be at the center of the Alliance, just as with all other development efforts. She said the Alliance should strive to shift world attention to a resilient development path that leads to human rights for all.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said policymakers should not lose sight of the urgency of climate action, which can unlock “massive economic and social benefits and accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development.” She also reminded participants that the UN’s framework for immediate socioeconomic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a roadmap for a systemic, multifaceted approach.

Mohammed cited a World Bank estimate that COVID-19 could push between 71 and 100 million more people into extreme poverty in 2020, “effectively wiping out progress made since 2017.” On 6 August 2020, the World Bank released a publication on these “new poor,” finding that the global poverty rate was originally projected to fall to 8.2% in 2019, but due to COVID-19, is now projected to increase to 8.8% (baseline) and 9.2% (downside) in 2020.

The discussion during the high-level meeting highlighted challenges in poverty eradication, noting that SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met, as roughly 75% of employed youths work in the informal sector and lack protection, while 126 million young workers still live in poverty.

The report of the meeting provides recommendations emerging from the meeting. These include:

Institute people-centred policies to allow for scaled up investment in universal healthcare, education, social protection, equitable access to digital technology, and support to micro- and medium-sized enterprises;

Scale up investment in agriculture and rural development within the context of national poverty eradication policies and plans;

Implement credible anti-corruption policies and strengthen the integrity of public institutions;

Prioritize reform of judiciary and law enforcement agencies, to provide an enabling environment for allocating resources productively; and

Improve support for developing countries to establish social protection floors.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the high-level meeting – which took place on 30 June 2020 – represents the start of a series of annual dialogues on poverty eradication.

Gates Foundation presents new data,"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters. Photo by: ganphotography / Flickr / CC BY-NC-ND

SAN FRANCISCO — The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a 7% increase in extreme poverty, with an additional 37 million people living below $1.90 a day, according to a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Devex @ UNGA 75 How is COVID-19 affecting progress on the SDGs? Will online meetings mean greater international representation? Our reporters are covering the all-virtual 75th United Nations General Assembly to find out.

The fourth annual Goalkeepers report, which launched on Monday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, draws on new data to provide what the Gates Foundation describes in a press release as “the most current global dataset for how the pandemic is affecting progress toward the Global Goals.”

In addition to quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the Sustainable Development Goals, Bill and Melinda Gates called for global collaboration on, and equitable delivery of, COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments in order to end the pandemic and get the SDGs back on track.

In its first three Goalkeepers reports, the Gates Foundation outlined steady progress on the SDGs, from reductions in malnutrition to improvements in literacy. But the 2020 report illustrates how COVID-19 has both stalled and reversed progress. For example, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Gates Foundation’s data partner in the Goalkeepers report, found that COVID-19 will cause vaccine coverage to drop to levels that were last seen in the 1990s.

“In other words, we’ve been set back about 25 years in about 25 weeks,” Bill and Melinda Gates note in the report, speaking to vaccine coverage, which they call “a good proxy for how health systems are functioning.”

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic. After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.” — Bill Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Bill Gates said he had just spent three hours on the phone with Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote about the ripple effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

“Other than South Africa and some countries in Northern Africa, the actual number of infections and deaths has not been large in Africa,” he said. “Sadly, as our report documents, there’s probably more negative effects on health because of the disruption to the health system including malaria bed nets, HIV drugs, TB drugs, and routine immunization or measles campaigns.”

In Africa, where most primary health care systems fell short of where they should be even before the pandemic, there is a particularly urgent need for progress on the SDGs to resume, Bill Gates said.

The Gates Foundation has also spent time examining the implications of COVID-19 on agriculture and food security, said Rodger Voorhies, president of the Gates Foundation’s Global Growth & Opportunity Division.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the COVID-19 economic crisis is building on worsening climate stresses, as well as the locust infestation, to create unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, he said.

Due to the economic shocks of COVID-19, the number of people suffering from food insecurity is expected to increase by 83 to 132 million, Voorhies said, adding the Gates Foundation is still trying to get a grasp on the impact of the pandemic on hunger and nutrition.

While the Goalkeepers report is filled with charts of how the world is backsliding on nearly every SDG indicator the Gates Foundation measures, COVID-19 is likely to accelerate progress in one area: financial inclusion.

“Faced with the urgent need to get cash to people quickly while helping them maintain social distance, more than 130 governments have created or improved digital cash transfer programs,” the report explains.

As countries make these transactions easier for communities with high levels of poverty, it is critical they seize this moment to ensure that rising bank account ownership leads to meaningful financial inclusion, particularly for women, Voorhies said.

“How do we build back in a way that really targets the most vulnerable?” he asked. “We say in my group: ‘Everyone benefits from an economy that includes everyone.’ How do we turn that into a reality?”

The Goalkeepers report includes models demonstrating how, if countries buy up COVID-19 vaccines in order to protect their own people, they will extend the life of the pandemic globally.

Northeastern University ran two scenarios: one where 50 high-income countries received the first 2 billion doses out of 3 billion doses and another where all countries received the 3 billion doses proportional to their populations and regardless of their ability to pay.

The simulations conclude that twice as many people could die of COVID-19 if vaccines are not distributed equitably.

In the report, Bill and Melinda Gates describe the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a global collaboration focused on the development and distribution of tools to fight the pandemic, as “the most serious collaborative effort to end the pandemic to date.”

During the press call, Bill Gates applauded commitments by French President Emmanual Macron, German President Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and said the ACT Accelerator will be close to the funding it needs for procurement “once the U.S. shows its interest.”

Gates emphasized the need for more tools to fight COVID-19, but added that once those tools are available, the question becomes “how do we get the manufacturing and generosity up?”

Already aspirational, some SDG targets may need to be redefined, while others may be entirely out of reach — but the goals remain a critical framework for cooperation, Bill Gates also explained.

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic,” he said. “After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.”

But Bill Gates expressed concern about donor financing for the SDGs as countries turn inward to deal with the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters.

The authors outline a role for the UN in building domestic political consensus to respond constructively to global megatrends, highlighting that the UN “can assist in mobilizing needed global support for individual countries, particularly those with fewer resources.”

The ‘Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time’ was launched on 16 September 2020. The UN Economists Network is led by the UN Chief Economist.

The UN’s 75th anniversary is an opportunity to forge a global commitment to digital cooperation, with goals, principles, and priority actions.

It looks at the “outright failures in policy” that have resulted in climate change, environmental degradation, and inequalities. “Climate change and environmental degradation have no positive side, and must be reversed. Similarly, the overall impact of persistent and rising inequalities is negative,” although some people may emerge as short-term winners. Further, these megatrends cannot be fully shaped by national policy; they require all countries to act in concert, the report underscores.

The economists offer guidance for policy makers on steering three other megatrends towards positive outcomes: demographic shifts, particularly population ageing; urbanization; and the emergence of digital technologies. On digital technologies, the report suggests that the UN is well placed to facilitate agreement on principles for “managing frontier technologies” and aligning the use of technology with ethical and human rights standards. The authors note that the UN’s 75th anniversary presents an opportunity for a global commitment to digital cooperation, which could enshrine goals, principles, and priority actions.

On reducing inequality, the report asserts that support for policy responses to inequality often “runs into a wall of vested interests.” The UN can help governments overcome such political constraints, the authors offer.

According to the report, achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking.” Policies to influence one megatrend as well as other megatrends that interact with it “can propel more effective, mutually reinforcing changes.” The authors stress that if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time in a direction that is sustainable and delivers benefits to all.” [Publication: Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time] [Executive Summary]","A group of UN economists has released a report aiming to set the stage for the high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary.

FAO is rolling out innovative data tools to help countries track progress as COVID-19 pandemic poses new monitoring challenges

15 September 2020, Rome/Geneva - The world was already off track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even harder both to achieve the Goals and to monitor progress where it is being made, according to a new report released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

""We need better data to better understand the path we need to take to get to our destination,"" said FAO Chief Economist Maximo Torero. ""Knowing more about where we are and how slowly or quickly we are moving will help us focus our efforts and actions to target interventions to achieve SDGs.""

The unprecedented global health crisis, with associated economic and social impacts, is ""making the achievement of these SDG targets even more challenging,"" according to the report, ""Tracking progress on food and agriculture-related SDG indicators 2020"".

Hunger, as well as other forms of food insecurity, are rising, and the pandemic has disrupted longer-term practices from conserving genetic resources as well as immediate operations such as national agricultural censuses, which are key both to identifying immediate needs and nudging the world's farmers to more sustainable practices. These censuses have been delayed, postponed or suspended in more than half of the 150 countries canvassed. Around one in four countries say that COVID-19 has disrupted national statistical agencies, with ""nearly all"" key data collection being adversely affected and vastly complicating FAO's work as the custodian agency for 21 SDG indicators and a contributing agency to another five.

The report assesses current trends, finding many stagnating - including the hunger benchmark known as Prevalence of Undernourishment used to track SDG target 2.1 - or even deteriorating - such as the broader Food Insecurity Experience Scale used for the same target. Many of the indicators, particularly for measuring smallholder labor productivity and incomes with the aim of doubling them by 2030, suffer from inadequate data to assess both current status and progress.

""Members can rely on FAO to help work through the often very substantial methodological complexity and pursue harmonized and comparable results that will enable the necessary acceleration of efforts to achieve the SDGs, as we enter the crucial Decade of Action culminating in 2030,"" said Pietro Gennari, FAO's chief statistician. ""And while the general assessment is concerning, it's also important to note positive trends, such as improved water use efficiency in Southern Asia, increases in plant genetic resource conservation efforts in Northern Africa, progress towards sustainable forest management, and some improvement in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing .""

Innovation can trump disruption

""The COVID-19 crisis makes the job more difficult but is also an opportunity to find new ways to work smarter, faster and harder,"" said Torero, who along with Gennari presented the report virtually in Geneva today.

FAO has set up a Big Data laboratory and tool to gather real-time information for a series of indicators, a Food Price Monitoring and Analysis tool, as well as the Hand in Hand Geospatial Platform, and is also increasing its efforts to bring all data public. The Organization is exploiting alternative data sources to help Members assess in real-time the impact of the pandemic disruptions on food systems and also to overcome the current limitations on data collection in the field. Satellite imagery is being used to identify and monitor risks of disruption on crop production and value chains. Machine-learning models have been developed to calibrate and classify crop prospects, and these are integrated with other data sets - including government restriction measures and trends on the impact of COVID-19, to inform evidence-based decision-making.

Some of the key findings

Agricultural productivity data are scarce, but indications are that small-scale food producers lag behind their larger peers. Data on smallholder incomes are relatively more abundant, but show that in most countries, smallholder incomes are less than half of those of larger producers.

Global holdings of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture rose to 5.43 million in 2019 from 4.21 million in 2005. But efforts to secure crop diversity for crop wild relatives and underutilized crop species continue to be insufficient.

The number of livestock breeds with sufficient genetic material stored to allow them to be reconstituted in case of extinction rose 10-fold in the decade to 2019. But they still amount to only 101 of the roughly 7 600 breeds reported around the world, some 73 percent of which are at risk of extinction.

Gender equality, investigated through the lens of women's land tenure, is far from realized, and legal provisions in many countries do not adequately protect the rights of women to land. Only 12 percent of assessed countries guarantee a very high degree of such protection.

Both forests and the sustainability of global fish stocks continue to decline, though at a slower pace than before.

Government investment in agriculture, measured as a share of GDP, has declined globally by around a third since 2001, led by sharp drops - from high levels - in much of Asia.

""Working together, we need to work together to find innovative ways to accelerate the information needed to catalyze the changes the world has pledged to achieve,"" said Torero.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several negotiation sessions and the meeting during which the post-2020 global biodiversity framework was expected to be adopted – the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) – have been postponed until 2021. A key event on the 2020 agenda remains on the sustainable development calendar, albeit in a virtual format: the UN Summit on Biodiversity.

To prepare for this meeting, share information with CBD Parties, and reinvigorate the global discussion on biodiversity issues, the CBD Secretariat organized a series of online sessions from 15-18 September 2020. The sessions were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the 24th meeting of the CBD’s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) and third meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI).

The fifth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook was launched on the first day of the virtual sessions. This flagship report provided a final report card on progress against the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by CBD Parties in 2010 and meant to be achieved by 2020. The report examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health. The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” to:

enhance conservation and restoration of ecosystems;

mitigate climate change;

take action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation;

move towards more sustainable production of goods and services; and

reduce consumption and waste.

On the second and third days, five countries presented reports on their implementation efforts, in an exercise to test a process for conducting party-led reviews of implementation of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This test was organized to support the effort to develop an enhanced review mechanism in the context of COP 15 and the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

Also on the third day, participants discussed a report from the Expert Panel on Resource Mobilization, which has identified challenges, including the presence of subsidies that are harmful to biodiversity, a lack of mainstreaming, a failure to address the private sector and other financial mechanisms, and a lack of priority for biodiversity outside environment ministries.

On the final day, the Co-Chairs of the Open-ended Working Group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, Basile van Havre and Francis Ogwal, provided an update on the zero draft of the framework. The Co-Chairs reported that the draft includes a new goal on means of implementation, milestones to ensure progress, and a deadline of 2030 for each target, among other changes. A target on the recovery and conservation of wild flora and fauna was added as well.

The UN Summit on Biodiversity is taking place as part of the opening weeks of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 75), with a high-level dialogue on the the theme, ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development’.

There is one aspect of the current pandemic that makes it particularly dangerous – and it has nothing to do with the contagiousness of the virus or with the potentially lethal disease it causes. What makes the COVID-19 pandemic especially dangerous is that it is striking at a time when respect for key principles of governance has been eroding across the globe for a number of years.

The pandemic is striking just when there are more autocracies than democracies in the world for the first time since 2001.

In March, the 2020 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index reported that more countries’ rule of law scores were declining rather than improving for the third year in a row. And for the first time since 2001, V-Dem’s Democracy Report 2020 found that there are more autocracies than democracies in the world.

Just when our societies need inclusive and accountable governments to respond effectively to an unprecedented health crisis, the number of such governments is in decline. This is trapping us in a downward cycle: while existing governance weaknesses worsen the impacts of the pandemic, the pandemic further erodes critical norms and institutions of governance. We see this trend in established democracies as well as in closed states, and in every region of the world.

Case Study: Corruption in Health Sector

Even without a pandemic, corruption is a pervasive problem in the health sector. In the COVID-19 context, this interferes with the delivery of essential medical supplies as patients resort to paying bribes for medical care in hospitals that face acute shortages.

If people do not have equal access to healthcare, clearly, the pandemic will gain momentum. In turn, COVID-19 is compounding the scourge of corruption as some governments are shortcutting anti-corruption procedures to speed up their response, and passing emergency laws criminalizing the spread of “misinformation,” including reports about government missteps. And yet, a public health crisis cannot be effectively overcome if audit agencies, potential whistleblowers, and other oversight mechanisms are hampered in their ability to provide checks on the use of public resources.

Need for Data on Governance Quality

These consequences highlight the importance of data on the quality of governance not only health and socio-economic data. Governance data can:

Draw attention to dysfunctions within governance systems that may hinder an effective response, with statistics on, for example, whether people can access justice mechanisms and if their problems are being resolved where courts are operating virtually;

Hold the government to account on its response plan and recovery strategy, with statistics on, for example, recipients of unemployment benefits or other income support, showing whether people without legal identity or formal employment could access emergency assistance, which can be used by oversight institutions and civil society at a time whenmany normal oversight and accountability processes have been severely disrupted; and

Provide early warnings of civil unrest and violence, with statistics on, for example, people’s trust in the police to keep their area safe during lockdown measures.

Despite these important benefits, governance statistics are noticeably absent from statistical discussions around COVID-19 and from the many national “COVID-19 dashboards” built to support response and recovery strategies around the world. The absence of governance statistics may be partly because they are a fairly new area of official statistics, and partly because attention has so far focused on tracking the epidemiological profile of the pandemic and its socio-economic impacts.

New Resource on Governance Challenges Posed by COVID-19

The Praia City Group on Governance Statistics, established in 2015 under the auspices of the UN Statistical Commission to “contribute to establishing international standards and methods for the compilation of statistics on the major dimensions of governance,” has just published a sequel to its comprehensive Handbook on Governance Statistics. That resource was launched in March 2020 and provided guidelines on producing and compiling official governance statistics. It focused on eight dimensions of governance: non-discrimination and equality; participation; openness; access to and quality of justice; responsiveness; absence of corruption; trust; and safety and security.

The sequel publication looks specifically at the governance challenges posed by COVID-19 in each of these eight areas. This new Praia Group Guidance Note on Governance Statistics in the COVID-19 Era consolidates the most practical and relevant measurement advice, and a few recommended indicators for National Statistical Offices and other governance data producers. Each thematic brief is intentionally selective and focuses on likely “priority governance data needs” of national actors to inform both the immediate response to COVID-19 and medium-term recovery action.

Our guidance keeps in mind the acute operational constraints faced by these actors – such as their greatly reduced mobility for data collection and declining funding for statistical production. This makes the resource applicable not only to the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also to other multidimensional crises that may arise in the future, and that will require a similarly robust governance response.

The Praia Group’s new Guidance Note is a reminder for all of us that information on the quality of governance is a public good, just like information on the health, demographic, or economic profile of a society. This is all the more vital in the COVID-19 era, which has been characterized by a proliferation of mis- and disinformation and has made it hard for policy-makers and the general public to find trustworthy sources and reliable data on which to base political and personal decisions.

The work of the Praia Group is a sign among many that this crisis, disastrous as it is, can also pave the way for innovative and new solutions. Each government can reflect on the kind of public institutions and governance mechanisms we need for our societies to withstand similar shocks in the future, and look to the burgeoning field of governance statistics. Right now, governance data can be used to build institutions back better and to empower the public in demanding the same.

Heads of State and Government will consider the policy menu at a high-level event on 29 September 2020.

Just like people with pre-existing conditions, countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19.

Speakers explained that developing countries are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many ways. As Ghana’s minister for finance said, the pandemic’s effects on Africa are “not a passing frigate, but a … dislocation of at least three years.”

Among the examples given:

Fiji has no active cases of COVID-19, but has lost revenue due to tourism and remittance declines. Similarly, the Maldives felt economic impacts of the pandemic before a case of COVID-19 was discovered locally, as it had to stop tourism for over three months – “the engine of our economic growth.”

Ghana could lose USD 1 billion through illicit financial flows, which is more than its entire health budget.

South Africa has the same debt-to-GDP ratio as Germany, but South Africa’s debt service payments are 4% of its GDP, while Germany’s are 0.7%. “This cannot be the right thing to do” in a time of such dire need, said Vera Songwe, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). High debt payments mean compromising test kits, tracing programmes, and acquiring vaccines.

Africa has no reserve currency, and will need USD 100billion/year to begin recovery.

The meeting on 8 September 2020 was convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and the finance ministers of Canada and Jamaica. Opening the meeting, the two convening ministers stressed the need for a multilateral response to the pandemic and the related economic crisis. Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance of Canada, acknowledged that the least developed countries (LDCs) feel the effects most acutely, lacking the resources to adopt recovery measures. Nigel Clarke, Minister of Finance of Jamaica, said the need for a global response to the pandemic has only increased, as its center of gravity has shifted to developing countries.

International officials then highlighted economic trends resulting from the pandemic, three priorities for policy makers, and the menu of policy options. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19, just like people with pre-existing conditions. She said countries that already had high debt levels are in terrible trouble, and tourism-dependent economies “are on their knees.” The priorities now are to: maintain support for these countries until their economies are fully turned around; extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) for another year; and invest in education, digital capacity, human capital, health systems, and social protection.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, said the menu of policy options provides measures for emergency response, recovery, and stability. Emergency mobilization measures could include extending and broadening the DSSI, declaring remittance services essential, and extending debt swap lines and special drawing rights (SDRs). Sustainable and inclusive recovering measures could include debt cancellations, debt-for-climate or debt-for-SDG swaps, and scaling up social protection and health coverage. Policy options for enabling a sustainable and resilient future including adopting climate-related financial risk disclosures, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and integrating the SDGs into national budgets.

Members of six discussion groups presented key findings of their work in June, July and August 2020, which generated the menu of policy options. For the group on external finance, remittances, jobs, and inclusive growth (Group 1), Japan reported that the G20 and Paris Club have agreed on an extension of the DSSI, and called for private sector funding. China announced that it is actively considering the DSSI extension. Egypt supported debt equity swaps to finance SDG-related investment.

On recovering better for sustainability (Group 2), the European Commissioner for Crisis Management stressed the need for a “green, digital, just, and resilient” recovery. Related policy options would support strong health systems, resource-efficient growth, and an open and secure digital society. He said this requires both public and private investment to fully align with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Rwanda said that in addition to an extended DSSI, developing countries also need: adjustments to the DSSI terms, debt restructuring, a replenished IDA 20, and access to financial markets at zero cost. “This is the road map” to recover better.

The UK said countries’ recovery plans should incorporate updated and enhanced climate NDCs, and they should align spending with the Paris Agreement. The UK will host the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021 (UNFCCC COP 26).

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) said digitalization can help mobilize finance and is a lifeline in this crisis. The International Development Finance Club (IDFC) said public development banks (PDBs) can help bridge the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and local policies, and momentum us growing between PDBs and stakeholders. IDFC announced that it will hold the ‘Finance in Common Summit’ on 12 November 2020, the first global meeting for all PDBs.

On global liquidity and financial stability (Group 3), Costa Rica announced a proposal for a USD 1 trillion fund to support emerging and poor countries with concessional loans for COVID-19 impacts. The World Bank echoed the importance of concessionality. Ghana said the SDR system should be extended. He cited a “disaster waiting to happen [in 2021] as countries begin to default.”

France and the World Bank indicated support for extending the DSSI. The World Bank added that more participation is needed from the private sector.

The Maldives proposed a tourism fund to ramp up testing in airports to restore trust in global travel. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) recommended a liquidity and sustainability facility to bring down the rates for debt service payments.

On debt vulnerability (Group 4), Pakistan said participation in the DSSI should not affect credit ratings. The African Union (AU) Commission said extending the DSSI is critical: “African countries need liquidity.”

The US said the G20 and Paris Club could consider further steps in 2021, depending on countries’ actions in the meantime, such as improving public financial management and directing investment to projects that strengthen economic growth).

The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) called or a debt swap for climate change to create a Caribbean resilience fund, which would require 12% of the total public debt (USD 7 billion).

On private sector creditors engagement (Group 5), Senegal said private sector DSSI might be relevant for certain countries, but it is not relevant for all, and “certainly not for Senegal.” Instead, it would “kick the can down the road” for countries that already have expensive commercial debt. Official debt cancellation will be needed for some countries, he stressed.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the aftermath of COVID-19 for developing countries – hunger, starvation, and poverty – will make its health consequences look very small.

Finally, on illicit financial flows (IFFs) (Group 6), Nigeria called for mutual legal assistance to address barriers to international cooperation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATAF) reported that the pandemic has been used to generate illicit funds, which are now flowing out of developing countries just when health services need it most. The solution is to implement the FATAF standards, he suggested.

Oxfam endorsed the recommendation to support the Addis Tax Initiative’s (ATI) 2020 mandate, and called for a UN tax convention to address tax havens, tax abuse, and other IFFs.

The ministers’ meeting will be followed by a Meeting of Heads and State and Government on 29 September to consider the policy options, and a series of thematic and regional meetings from October to December.

A follow-up meeting in December 2020 is being planned in order to benchmark progress in the context of the Decade of SDG Action.

271,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/global-hunger-and-trade-under-global-warming/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Global Hunger and Trade under Global Warming,"By Charlotte Janssens, Petr Havlík and Ansa Heyl

In a warmer world, decreasing crop yields and rising food prices are expected to strongly jeopardize the achievement of SDG 2 – ending global hunger. Climate change has consequences for food production worldwide, but there are clear differences between regions. Sufficient food is expected to remain available in the Northern hemisphere, while in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia, falling crop yields may lead to higher food prices and a sharp rise in hunger.

In our recent publication in Nature Climate Change, we find that world trade can relieve these regional differences and provide a way to reduce hunger risks under climate change. For example, if regions like Europe and Latin America where wheat and corn thrive increase their production and export food to regions under heavy pressure from the warming of the Earth, food shortages can be reduced.

Global Hunger by 2050

The State of Food and Nutrition Security in the World 2020 reports that globally almost 690 million people were at risk of hunger in 2019. Many factors determine how global hunger will develop in the future, including population growth and economic development, as demonstrated in a study in Environmental Research Letters. Our article uses the “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic pathway where population reaches 9.2 billion, income grows according to historical trends, and the number of undernourished people decreases to 122 million by 2050. Within this socioeconomic setting, we investigate the impact of different climate change scenarios and trade policies on global hunger by 2050.

The worst-case climate scenario of a 4°C warming leads to an extra 55 million people enduring hunger – a 45% increase compared to the situation without climate change. In a protectionist trade environment where vulnerable regions cannot increase their food imports as a response to climate impacts, this effect rises to 73 million. The largest hunger risks are located in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with respectively a 33 million and 15 million increase in people at risk of hunger in the worst-case climate scenario.

Where barriers to trade are eliminated, “only” 20 million people endure food shortages due to climate change. While this number is high, it is a vast improvement on the 73 million people that would potentially be exposed to hunger without the suggested measures. In the milder climate change scenarios, an intensive liberalization of trade may prevent even more people from enduring hunger owing to global warming. Yet a liberalization of international trade may also involve potential dangers. If Asian countries increase rice exports without making more imports of other products possible, they could well end up with a food shortage within their own borders.

Mobilizing Investment

Our study shows not only that the challenge of ending global hunger is strongly determined by the extent of progress on SDG 13 (climate action), but also that achievement of SDG 2 (zero hunger) is affected by developments articulated in SDG 9 (resilient infrastructure). We find that international trade can relieve regional food shortages and reduce hunger, particularly where trade barriers are eliminated. Such trade integration requires phasing out import tariffs as well as the facilitation of trade through investment in transport infrastructure and technology. Especially in low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa infrastructure is weak. In its 2018 African Economic Outlook, the African Development Bank (AfDB) estimates that between USD 130 billion and 170 billion a year is needed to bridge the infrastructure gap in the region by 2025. Given that infrastructure finance averaged only USD 75 billion in recent years, and the largest contribution is coming from budget-constrained national governments, alternative financing through institutional and private investments could be crucial in the face of climate change.

Crisis and Protectionism

In times of crisis, countries are inclined to adopt a protectionist stance. For example, in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have temporarily closed their borders for the export of important food crops (see IFPRI Food Trade Policy Tracker for updated information). Some commentators warn that such measures can have large detrimental effects on food security. Our study finds that also in the context of climate change, a well-thought-out liberalization of trade is needed in order to be able to relieve food shortages properly.

WASHINGTON — With elusive progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in fragile contexts drastically compromised by COVID-19, there is a critical need for effective aid spending, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “States of Fragility 2020” report.

The annual report examined the most fragile contexts in 2020 in two parts: the global state of fragility before the virus struck, and how the resulting pandemic is dramatically impacting that landscape. It examines fragile state progress on the SDGs, and reviews levels of finance available to support them, calling for urgent action by OECD countries to maintain official development assistance levels, support access to other types of financing, and promote policies for fragile contexts.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment ...” — Susanna Moorehead, chair, OECD Development Assistance Committee

Of those living in extreme poverty globally, 76.5% live in fragile contexts — representing 23% of the world’s population. Only small improvements were found in the 2020 analysis of 57 countries and territories, and they are expected to be jeopardized by COVID-19, which has contributed to mass unemployment, increased poverty, heightened inequalities, political unrest, and rising gender-based violence.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health, economic, and social crisis without precedent in living memory. It’s also revealed the immense importance of strong states, efficient governments, and solid social security systems to confront the pandemic,” said Jorge Moreira da Silva, director of the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate, at a launch event on Thursday. “The early estimates, using the most recent projections from the World Bank, suggest that the pandemic will result in 26 million additional people in fragile contexts falling into extreme poverty by the end of this year.”

How off track are the SDGs, exactly? We don't know, but it might not matter Lagging official data makes it challenging to have an up-to-date picture of the pandemic's impact on the SDGs. But it is clear that the goals require renewed support and financing, experts explain ahead of the U.N. General Assembly.

Susanna Moorehead, OECD Development Assistance Committee chair, called the numbers in the report “terrifying” and said the figures show that poverty reduction is not merely off-track, but in reverse. She said DAC must mobilize political momentum and resources for fragile countries by spending ODA more wisely and making funds go further.

In 2018, $76 billion in bilateral ODA went to fragile contexts — more than ever before. After remittances, ODA is the second largest form of external finance to fragile countries, and it has increased every year since 2014.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment … Official development assistance is under enormous pressure and it is certain that demand will outstrip supply,” Moorehead said. “You only have to think about the humanitarian burden that the world’s facing, and it is DAC donors who will pick up a very substantial part of the costs of that over the course of the next year or so. But fragility, we know, is expensive … if you don’t invest in stability, it costs you more.”

Making ODA more effective means making sure the international community is coordinating assistance and that there is less competition between agencies. It also requires a focus on programs that prioritize resilience and investment in conflict prevention and peace building, she said.

Helder da Costa, general secretary of the g7+, a group of fragile states, said that despite the pandemic, ending active conflict and war around the world must remain the number one priority.

“Conflict prevention cannot and should not be summed up as compilation of ad hoc projects and activities funded and fragmented in analysis and theories. Pursuing stability that rests on a capable state, functioning institutions, and [a] vibrant economy should be our end,” da Costa said. “For the g7+ countries, we did not need a pandemic to learn this hard lesson. Our member countries have been living such a reality for decades.”

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said that the coronavirus has aggravated multiplied issues of fragility — the burden of which tends to disproportionately fall “on those who are already vulnerable and marginalized.” Before COVID-19, only 8 of the 48 fragile contexts where data is available were on track to meet SDG 1, ending poverty.

Thirteen of the countries examined in the report are categorized as extremely fragile, with the top five being Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 2012 and 2018, the gap in levels of fragility between the extremely fragile states and non-fragile contexts increased every year. In 11 of the 13 extremely fragile states, progress has stagnated on hunger and gender equality-related SDGs while in more than half of nonfragile contexts, progress is increasing or on track for meeting the goal.","“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else.

The meeting aimed to set a work plan for 2021, the last year in a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Convention, among other objectives.

The Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) guides work between meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP). Building on outcomes of the 19th COP in 2019, the 12th meeting of the OEWG convened for the first of two segments – an online segment on 1 and 3 September 2020 (with 2 September featuring online side events on legal issues for the Convention). The second segment is expected to be an in-person segment in March 2021. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the online segment of OEWG12 “paved the way for quick decisions at the March 2021 face-to-face segment, if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.”

The OEWG worked to advance technical guidelines on:

wastes containing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury;

incineration on land and on specially engineered landfills; and

the identification and environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic wastes and their disposal.

Participants also followed up on actions taken in 2019: amending the Basel Convention annexes to deal with plastic waste, and creating a new Plastic Waste Partnership. In his address to OEWG12, Basel Convention Executive Secretary Rolph Payet pleaded with parties not to backtrack on their commitments to reduce single-use plastics and to renew efforts in this regard.

In the discussion, countries differed over whether they should further address upstream matters on preventing plastic waste. They also considered the value of an effectiveness assessment of action so far. The ENB reports that intervening parties supported vigorous follow-up to the 2019 amendment and the work of the Plastic Waste Partnership, but several expressed concern whether an effectiveness assessment is premature.

As explained by the ENB, OEWG12 still needs to decide the fate of an update of the technical guidelines on plastic waste, guidance on creating national inventories on plastic waste, a report on possible future activities on the issue under the Convention, the status of the Plastic Waste Partnership, and a proposal to the World Customs Organization to amend the Harmonized System to identify plastic wastes.

The OEWG also discussed technical guidelines on transboundary movements of e-waste and used electrical and electronic equipment, which were adopted in 2019. A deadline of 30 October 2020 is in place for parties to use and test the guidelines. Two countries introduced a proposal to make all e-waste shipments (whether or not considered hazardous) subject to the prior informed consent procedure. While some parties expressed support for the idea, several observers raised concerns that it would not improve the e-waste trade situation and would not support the transition towards a circular economy.

On ESM of waste lead-acid batteries, many participants indicated an urgent need to update the technical guidelines.

The Group also spent time on a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Basel Convention (2012-2021), which will end next year. The Group reviewed the status of the draft report on the evaluation of this framework.

Per the ENB, as the online segment closed, OEWG12 still needed to reach agreement on a number of proposals to improve Convention implementation before COP15:

recommendations of the evaluation of the Strategic Framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention;

a practical manual for stakeholders to ensure that notifications of transboundary movements meet ESM requirements under the Convention;

recommendations for possible amendment proposals to the Convention’s annexes;

options for a system under the Convention to allow the automation of processes and the electronic exchange of information relating to the notification and movement of hazardous and other wastes; and

practical manuals on preparing national inventories on priority waste streams.

OEWG12 is now suspended. It plans to reconvene at a face-to-face meeting in March 2021, in Nairobi, Kenya (back-to-back with the fifth UN Environment Assembly, UNEA-5). This tentative plan is subject to the availability of resources and a positive development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outcomes of the deliberations of the OEWG will be transmitted to COP 15, scheduled to be held back-to-back with the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention (RC COP-10) and the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention (SC COP-10) from 19-30 July 2021, in Geneva, Switzerland. The collective theme of the meetings will be ‘Global Agreements for a Healthy Planet: Sound management of chemicals and waste.’ [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of OEWG 12] [Basel Convention website]","A working group of government representatives convened virtually to discuss several items on the agenda for the Basel Convention on the movement and disposal of hazardous wastes.

On 24 September 2020, the Hub featured sessions on how nature can support achieving the SDGs, with a focus on: nature for climate; nature for water; and scaling up financing. The session on Nature for Climate emphasized the role of ecosystems in climate change mitigation, with one participant saying the world has woken up to the fact that nature underpins our economy and the spread of COVID-19 has confirmed that protecting nature is about protecting ourselves. The benefits from protecting nature are delivered immediately and accrued to locals, he reminded. He stressed as the necessary next steps: defunding deforestation; promoting equity and social justice; and prioritizing natural climate solutions in economic recovery.

The world has woken up: protecting nature is about protecting our economy and ourselves.

Other key messages included:

forests and nature can deliver a third of the needed emission reductions, and reversing their degradation will be fundamental for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement;

natural climate solutions have moved to the center of the climate change debate, and they are increasingly understood to be an essential complement to decarbonization in climate action; and

nature-based solutions, however, have only received 3% of global climate finance.

In a joint statement, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called for: placing nature at the heart of sustainable development; building a green, inclusive and circular economy; and mobilizing action from every corner of society. Zac Goldsmith, Minister for Pacific and the Environment, UK, said his government will increase the share spent on nature-based solutions in its climate finance.

A session on Nature for Water highlighted how nature-based solutions can build long-term water security. Key messages included:

Water is finite, but our need for it is growing – this relationship needs balancing.

Communities, cities, corporations, and other stakeholders are already engaging in activities that integrate nature-based solutions into water management while generating social and economic benefits.

Trust is a crucial element for ensuring acceptance for nature-based solutions that require investments, and a lot more can be accomplished when various stakeholders work together.

Further efforts are needed to: quantify the benefits of nature-based solutions to build an evidence base for support; nature-based solutions and “grey solutions” need to be assessed holistically; and enabling environments for nature-based solutions need to enhanced.

Among other success stories, Xanthea Limburg, City of Cape Town, explained how the city’s water strategy builds on the experience of successfully avoiding “day zero” in 2018 (when the municipal water supply almost had to be cut off) and includes the principle of working with nature. Ulrike Sapiro, The Coca-Cola Company, said that, of her company’s 300 water replenishment projects that seek to replenish all water the company uses in production processes globally, 230 are dedicated to working with nature.

Stuart Orr, WWF, observed a growing interest in mainstreaming nature-based solutions from investors who see water scarcity-related risks affecting their assets. As constraints to mobilizing financing, Gilles Kleitz, French Development Agency, identified a lack of: technical and performance standards for nature-based solutions; active dialogue with consultancies on performance; and rigorous financing models for NBS.

On 25 September, the Nature for Life Hub focused on business and finance. A key theme was the need to disrupt business-as-usual by placing nature at the center of decision-making. Participants discussed ways to better align goals to protect, restore and sustainably manage nature with goals for sustainable economic development and financial investment. During this event, the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge was launched. Through this Pledge, 26 financial institutions committed to protect and restore biodiversity through their finance activities and investments.

On 28 September – dubbed “global ambition day” – global leaders and stakeholders showcased commitments to promoting a nature-based planetary safety net. A Nature Finance Forum presented key message including:

governments must de-risk investments to create incentives for the private sector;

governments alone cannot create change – philanthropists also need to target their efforts;

businesses must be mobilized to reduce their own carbon footprints and to help establish enabling environments for entrepreneurs; and

finance is needed for Indigenous stewards and to protect the poorest communities who depend on biodiversity

The Day included a Leaders’ Event to mark the launch of the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, developed by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Belize, Bhutan, Colombia, Costa Rica, EU, Finland, Kenya, Seychelles and UK, along with intergovernmental and NGO partner organizations. The pledge was launched in support of the first UN Summit on Biodiversity, on 30 September 2020, and the post-2020 biodiversity framework, which countries are expected to agree on at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China (CBD COP 15) in 2021.

Endorsers and supporters of the pledge commit to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, through ten specific actions. At the time of the event, the pledge had attracted endorsements by 70 countries and numerous non-state actors, and hosts expected this number to keep rising.

Opening the event, Volkan Bozkır, President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), lamented that none of the Aichi Targets on biodiversity have been fully achieved, and expressed hope that the September Summit “elevate the political discourse on biodiversity” and become an important step on the road to Kunming.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for the new global biodiversity framework to provide a roadmap for implementation. He commended leaders for launching the pledge and called on everyone to make 2021 “nature’s year.”

In pre-recorded statements, government leaders underscored:

There is a need to recognize the interdependence between people and ecosystems.

The current market system fails to capture most ecosystem values. Natural capital needs to be restored, and societies must change how they finance, produce and consume.

Goals related to the pledge include zero biodiversity loss, nature-positive development, carbon neutrality, and resilience.

Biodiversity conservation is a strategic investment in health, jobs, livelihoods and food security, and protects humanity from diseases.

Urgent, practical and ambitious actions are needed, including robust goals and strong monitoring mechanisms.

All parts of governments should engage in implementing the pledge, and concerted action is needed from governments, businesses and civil society.

Indigenous experience and knowledge should be harnessed, and local communities need to be enlisted to support implementation.

Economic recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate the goal of “saving our life support system.”

Business and civil society leaders highlighted that:

Economies and businesses depend on nature.

Humanity is pushing the planet dangerously close to a tipping point that could result in irreversible destabilization of the system.

Governments need to create the conditions for the private sector to achieve the biodiversity targets.

Financial institutions have announced a Finance for Biodiversity Pledge that includes a target of collaborating and sharing knowledge, engaging with companies, setting targets and reporting on them publicly, by 2024.

60 major faith traditions will develop “faith long-term plans” to protect nature.

Equity, justice and women’s rights should be at the heart of efforts to halt biodiversity loss.

Nature is fundamental for protecting human health.

Closing the day, CBD Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called on all stakeholders to come together in global solidarity to take urgent action. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen outlined five areas where transitions are necessary: food systems; resource extraction; energy systems; green infrastructure investments; and land degradation. She called on governments to ensure all post-COVID-19 stimulus packages include “green strings” and reminded that “failure is not an option.”

The fourth day focused on Local Action, with ten winners of the Equator Prize announced. [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of Nature for Life Hub]","On 24 September 2020, the Hub featured sessions on how nature can support achieving the SDGs, with a focus on: nature for climate; nature for water; and scaling up financing.
The benefits from protecting nature are delivered immediately and accrued to locals, he reminded.
He stressed as the necessary next steps: defunding deforestation; promoting equity and social justice; and prioritizing natural climate solutions in economic recovery.
The world has woken up: protecting nature is about protecting our economy and ourselves.
Further efforts are needed to: quantify the benefits of nature-based solutions to build an evidence base for support; nature-based solutions and “grey solutions” need to be assessed holistically; and enabling environments for nature-based solutions need to enhanced."

Deutsche Post DHL Group, Microsoft Corp. and the PwC network (“PwC”) have already joined the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility and the initiative is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to contribute.

The Global Facility is a response to corporate calls to action for private sector leaders and governments to work together to address the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The initiative has been established to better coordinate their responses, helping to ensure that immediate stimulus efforts flow into the real economy.

The Global Facility will operate at both the global and national levels. It aims to co-create solutions that are tailored to the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given area and the specificities of the local private sector and government context. Guided by the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Facility will support a multisectoral, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to face the multidimensional nature of the crisis. Recovery efforts will focus on how to rebuild more inclusive economies and societies, to set a new course for a socially just, low-carbon and climate-resilient world where no one is left behind. Initial projects will focus on the countries of Colombia, Ghana, the Philippines and Turkey. Both the geographical scope and participating partners will expand as the Global Facility develops.

“Solidarity to ‘Recover Better Together’ can boost our collective efforts not only to cope with the crisis but overcome it. UNDP’s footprint across some 170 countries and territories, combined with the UN Global Compact’s network of more than 10,000 companies and 68 Local Networks around the world, and the International Chamber of Commerce’s network of over 45 million companies, multiplies our collective capacity and potential. The Facility is the first of its kind – designed to join forces across public and private sectors to serve humanity in an imperative moment,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility was announced by Mr Steiner at the SDG Business Forum during the UN General Assembly, the largest and most inclusive UN convening of private sector leaders. Launched under the motto “Recover Better Together”, the timing of this initiative has special importance, marking the commemoration of some important UN-related milestones: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations; the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Compact; and the Centenary of ICC’s founding after WWI at a time when multilateralism is facing the greatest challenge of its generation.

Initiating partners

The Initiating Partners are UNDP, UN Global Compact and ICC. Together, they will bring their unique access to global expertise on responsible business practices, economic recovery, green business transformation and multi-hazard risk management.

“As COVID-19 disrupts societies, development agendas must adjust accordingly. There is a need for inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the critical contributions of civil society, business, foundations, the research community, local authorities, cities and regional governments. By unlocking public-private and private-private cooperation for a sustainable response to COVID-19 challenges, it is possible to recover better and build more resilient economies,” said Mr Steiner.

The private sector has been acutely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact affirm the belief that businesses exist to serve and advance their societies, and their success cannot come at the cost of social or environmental regression.

“It is a moment of human tragedy and intense economic and social upheaval. But it is also a moment of possibility. Through partnerships like the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility we will support companies to Recover Better Together from the pandemic and finally confront global inequality by taking action, as well as mitigate the worst impacts of a climate emergency that threatens all of humanity. Together we can construct a new paradigm of resilience,” saidSanda Ojiambo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced around 70% of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to shut down their operations. SMEs represent 50% of global GDP and more than 70% of global employment. The partners of the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility, representing multinational, global and local private sector stakeholders, commit to joint projects to develop policy and financial solutions for pandemic relief.

ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said: “ICC’s local networks can bring value to the cooperation by reaching small business owners who want to have their challenges understood, their ideas heard, and their efforts to Recover Better recognised and built upon by others. SMEs need a way to facilitate this vital exchange of ideas, learning and experience with each other and with organisations and institutions in a position to support them.”

﻿

Private sector involvement

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility is supported by strategic partners DHL, Microsoft and PwC, and is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to join this initiative. The strategic partners will add their expertise and technology to support this transformational recovery.

“In the current situation our employees recognize more than ever before their contribution to the well-being of the population. Under extremely difficult circumstances Deutsche Post DHL Group kept the global flow of goods, secured supply chains and provided the world with the necessary protective equipment. We want to share our experience of operating during one of the biggest health crises in recent history to protect lives against the pandemic. Join our efforts of connecting people improving lives to address the upcoming challenges together with our long standing partner UNDP,” said Monika Schaller, EVP Group Communications, Sustainability and Brand.

Deutsche Post DHL Group embarked upon the idea to support the Global Facility before its launch. The company underlined that their world-wide network enables them to make a difference on the ground for the local SMEs and helps them to survive in the present situation by solving logistical constraints.

“In line with Microsoft’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, we firmly believe technology can be a force for good in these challenging times and we’re proud to partner with public and private sector partners in an effort to accelerate global recovery. We see The Global Facility as an opportunity to create economic opportunities for all, bring our sustainability investments forward to support growth and recovery in a manner that advances our shared environmental agendas, and use data and AI to a build a system of intelligence to help all stakeholders better target their efforts to the communities that need the most help.” said Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft VP and Global Head of Tech for Social Impact.

Firms from the global professional services network PwC joined the initiative at its conceptual stage with UNDP. PwC will continue to play an instrumental role in supporting the design and establishment of this flagship global public-private cooperation. Additionally, PwC will help to develop finance and policy solutions and coordinate multistakeholder engagement. PwC’s role in the Global Facility is led by PwC Poland and supported by PwC Canada, PwC Hungary, PwC India, PwC Norway, PwC Middle East, PwC Switzerland, PwC Turkey and PwC UK.

“At PwC, our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Together with our clients and communities, we are working to assess and mitigate the major challenges that the pandemic poses for our economies and societies. We are proud to be working with our public and private sector partners to help structure and implement real pandemic relief solutions that make a difference in people’s lives,” said Agnieszka Gajewska, PwC Poland Partner, CEE Public Sector and Infrastructure Leader.

In order to effectively reach the most vulnerable in the most efficient ways, the facility aims to expand the list of strategic partners.

The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariat reports that it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.

In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’s Montreal Protocol has facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.

The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, which came into force in January 2019. It calls for reducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

In her message on the International Day, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that if fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment will prevent 0.4°C of global warming.

According to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals and Investment, Mrs Solape Hammond, the endeavour is a symbol of the State’s strong leadership, vision and commitment towards greater development.

Hammond also stressed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s spirited resolve to address the development needs of Lagosians, particularly in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

“The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has heightened the call for renewed dedication to sustainable development by governments at various levels, which Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has taken as a great priority and infused in the state’s development agenda codenamed THEMES (Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism as well as Security and Governance).

“While the pandemic has significantly exacerbated some of the problems Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are set to solve, it has also triggered the necessity for more concerted actions in addressing many developmental issues troubling our world,” she asserted.

Hammond disclosed that the event, in commemoration of the United Nations’ Global Goals Week, will run till the end of September 2020, and will mobilise collaborative efforts to connect SDGs actors and cross-sector stakeholders with a view to identifying solutions, reviewing progress, amplifying awareness, collaborating and reaffirming commitment towards accelerating efforts to achieve the 17 SDGs and the 2030 agenda.

She explained that the State Government is setting lofty precedence in the country, and perhaps in Africa by effectively mobilising individual action towards the attainment of the SDGs, and added that the administration would continue to drive, extract and utilise available platforms towards improving the living standard of the people.

In his remark, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on SDGs, Mr. Lekan Fatodu, said the focus is to double up our efforts and galvanise more actions towards the attainment of the global goals.

“Lagos State is reputable for audacious strides and accomplishments. And these remarkable traits are consistently being brought to bear in our approaches towards realising the SDGs. This maiden SDGs Week is a clear demonstration of our acknowledgement of many dynamic and relevant ways of amplifying the significance of the SDGs and, more importantly, a strategic way of identifying and attracting passionate drivers of the SDGs in Lagos State to join hands towards achieving the goals.

“The effort to reach everybody, including the most vulnerable and marginalized, requires strong community and citizen engagement and organic participation. This strategy holds great value as we approach the last decade of SDGs,” he affirmed.

Fatodu further stated that “the Sustainable Development Goal Week is a proactive and ground-breaking initiative to implement joint efforts towards meeting the targets and indicators of the SDGs”.

While applauding the unalloyed contributions of prominent individuals, Corporate Institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Governor’s aide revealed that “the initiative will further bring to fore the need for urgent and collective effort towards finding sustainable solutions to current and impending challenges facing humanity”.

The SDGs week will feature sustainable development-related activities that are intrinsically linked in their purpose to fast-track efforts towards progress in realizing the SDGs. Some of these activities include the Open Goals Adoption by top state functionaries and prominent Lagos residents, the Neighbourhood Outreach Campaign to enlighten citizens on their roles in achieving the Goals and an SDGs discourse with CSOs and youth groups that are focused on the SDGs.

The highlight of the week will be the distribution of support items and relief materials donated by corporate organisations and well-meaning Lagosians to vulnerable people in some communities and the disbursement of exercise books to primary schools in rural communities. This is in tandem with the ‘Turn It Around’ theme of the Global Goals Week, which seeks to empower people and communities to stem the negative tide of the pandemic as the deadline for the achievement of the global goals draws nearer.

In support of the Lagos SDGs Week and SDG 2 – Zero Hunger, the Old English Bakery will open all its outlets across Lagos State, where thousands of free loaves of bread will be given to Lagosians.

Amongst the reputable organisations and individuals supporting the inaugural Lagos SDGs Week are Procter & Gamble, Post Assurance Brokers, accomplished entrepreneur and global SDGs advocate, Mr. Tonye Cole; CEO, Post Assurance Brokers, Mr. Lekan Ajisafe; Human Resources expert, Ms. Mary Dinah and businessman, Akogun Lanre Alfred.","The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

281,https://theseeker.ca/2020/09/united-way-centraide-of-sdg-launched-2020-campaign-on-facebook-live/,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Seeker,United Way/Centraide of SDG launched 2020 Campaign on Facebook Live,"[CORNWALL, September 10] The United Way/Centraide of SDG officially launched its 2020 Campaign on Facebook Live today. A key theme of the 30-minute video was the importance of strategic partnerships and collaboration to effectively meet the challenges of poverty in our community, and how the United Way of SDG strives to be a leader in poverty reduction.

“A dollar to the United Way is spent in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing costs, sharing expertise and building together the community we call home,” said Juliette Labossière, Executive Director of United Way of SDG, during the live virtual event.

The United Way/Centraide of SDG members continued to grow in 2020 with the organization funding 16 local agencies and 20 programs compared to 14 agencies and 16 programs in 2019. In 2020-2021, the United Way of SDG will invest $337,786 into the community through these 16 agencies who all fall under the organization’s three pillars: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be and building strong and healthy communities.

Labossière further talked about the increased relevancy of The United Way of SDG and several local organizations during the current pandemic, touching on how strategic partnerships with the Social Development Council of Cornwall & Area, 30 members of the Emergency Response Council, and the generosity of the City of Cornwall and citizens across our entire region contributed to fewer people being negatively impacted by the pandemic than could have been. It was the advocacy and a coordinated approach through these partnerships that enabled the United Way of SDG to distribute $530,000 into our region over the last 5 months. This included Akwesasne, Cornwall and all of our counties.

The work to ease our way out of the pandemic, however, is far from over and the United Way of SDG worries about the real social impact of the pandemic that will emerge in the next few months.

“I urge you to think about the United Way as the united front that will assist our community and non-profits to weather this upcoming storm and support the community on all levels as necessary,” Labossière asked of the viewers as their support is vital to the United Way’s continued work in the community.

David Booyink, Campaign Chair, also shared a few words on why he volunteers, “I’ve always had this growing desire since I was a young boy to save lives, to make a difference.” Volunteering is a way everyone can help, and the United Way of SDG urges you to research its member agencies and look for opportunities to get involved.

Maureen Miller, a mother of two, shared how volunteers changed her life. She discussed her experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall (a United Way of SDG member agency), emphasizing just how much of an impact the program has had on her kids’ lives. It has given them the support and friendships they need to find happiness and explore new opportunities that they may not have had if not for the mentorship of their Big Brothers and Big Sister.

And to end the live event, John Hoyles, Executive Director of the Community Information Centre of Ottawa, shared an important resource that everyone in SDG can use. 211 is an informational helpline and website that connects people to the right information and services to navigate life’s challenges. This resource saw a 20% increase in SDG during the first few months of COVID-19 and Hoyles expects it will increase in popularity as we move into winter.

“The most important thing for us is to get more people to know about 211,” Hoyles stressed as this is a service for people to turn to when they have nowhere to go. His goal is to “make 211 just as known as 911,” and encourages viewers to help spread the word about this lifeline for the people who need it.

282,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-mulan,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Mulan’,"Replacing songs, bickering ancestral spirits and a tiny dragon sidekick with a shapeshifting witch and high-flying martial arts, this live-action remake doesn’t quite rise to the heights of Disney’s best remakes, but still manages to stand on its own.

At this point it seems pretty clear that the kiss of death, creatively speaking, for Disney’s new line of live-action/CGI remakes is a Broadway musical.

Until now, the better Disney remakes have been inspired reworkings of older films (Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Pete’s Dragon) that improved on their predecessors. The beloved cartoons of the Disney Renaissance (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin), on the other hand, have been adapted with stifling “fidelity,” serving only to highlight the superiority of the hand-animated originals. (Tim Burton’s Dumbo makes the point that loose adaptations of non-Renaissance cartoons can also be uninspired.)

Disney’s 1998 Mulan, loosely inspired by Chinese folklore about a woman named Hua Mulan who disguises herself as a man to take her father’s place in battle, is a Renaissance cartoon — but the remake, from director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) and several writers, including husband-wife reboot specialists Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes; Jurassic World; Avatar 2), doesn’t treat the cartoon as a sacred text.

Instead, following in the footsteps of Cinderella and The Jungle Book, the new Mulan weaves elements of the cartoon with new threads drawn from older sources (in this case The Ballad of Mulan and the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties) as well as new material invented for the film.

For example, Mulan’s ancestors are still reverentially invoked, along with the family’s “ancestral guardian,” here represented by a stone phoenix rather than a stone dragon. But the ancestors no longer appear as bickering luminous spirits or in any other form, and Eddie Murphy’s wisecracking dragon sidekick has been replaced with a silent, kite-like phoenix that may or may not exist in Mulan’s imagination.

The new Mulan isn’t even a musical — a liberty that would be unthinkable if the brand extended to Broadway. Instead, it’s a visually lavish, wuxia-influenced martial-arts action movie with warriors running on sheer walls or flying through the air to kick spears or arrows in midflight toward new targets with superhuman precision.

The result, while it doesn’t necessarily improve on its animated predecessor, isn’t overshadowed by it either and finds its own reason for existing.

Most notably, the redoubtable Gong Li plays a shapeshifting witch named Xianniang who serves the leader of the Rouran Khanate invading force led by fearsome Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee).

In the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties, Xianniang was a warrior daughter of the enemy king who bonded with Mulan after learning that Mulan, too, was a woman in a man’s world. Li’s Xianniang likewise feels a connection to Mulan (Liu Yifei), even if the feeling isn’t mutual.

Hated and feared even by her allies because of her magical powers, Xianniang serves the Khan in the hope of a future in which she might be accepted.

Mulan isn’t a witch, though she may be at risk of being branded one. From her youth she has had a natural gift for wielding chi — life force or energy — and her doting father, Zhou (Tzi Ma), a disabled veteran, couldn’t resist training his little girl as he would a son.

As she grows, though, Mulan’s exuberant antics — highlighted in a fun opening set piece involving a chicken — are increasingly socially unacceptable.

A daughter, we’re told over and over (a lot of things are repeated over and over), brings honor to her family by making a good marriage; Mulan must hide her gifts and learn to comport herself as a traditional Chinese bride.

This is potentially the stuff of “Squelched Girl Syndrome,” and, while Mulan is too spirited to be fully squelched, she does internalize the pressure to hide her gifts a bit too well.

Even passing as a man in Imperial Army boot camp, she berates herself after being provoked into revealing her abilities during a sparring match with a handsome recruit named Chen Honghui (Yoson An). (Donnie Yen plays the commanding officer who takes an interest in Mulan’s prowess. In contrast to the cartoon, Mulan’s romantic feelings are for her fellow recruit rather than her commander, reflecting post-Me Too concerns about romantic or sexual interest between leaders and subordinates.)

Xianniang, of course, sees through Mulan’s pretense — and, strikingly, sees her deception as a kind of compromising weakness, one with consequences. One of the themes in this telling is that Mulan fails to live up to the third of three virtues engraved on her father’s sword: “Loyal,” “Brave” and “True.” The cartoon Mulan’s true identity is accidentally revealed following an injury; the live-action film takes a different path.

Crucially, Caro directs combat sequences with flair; standout sequences include a face-off between Mulan’s company and Rouran fighters in a narrow corridor in the Imperial City, the capture of the Emperor (who mounts a terrific resistance, as you’d expect from Jet Li, but is overcome in a clever way) and the final showdown between Mulan and Bori Khan.

At times the wuxia elements seem inconsistently deployed. Long after it’s established that Mulan can run on walls and fly through the air, she has to clamber laboriously over rooftops — but only sometimes — at a moment when speed is of the essence. And while I liked that corridor fight in the Imperial City, shouldn’t Rouran fighters who can wield chi well enough to run on walls be more than a match for a similar number of Imperial troops who can’t?

I enjoyed Mulan, but I couldn’t avoid the sense of disconnect inherent in watching a wuxia-style period piece with Chinese actors speaking accented English dialogue. I imagine the disconnect will be sharper for Asian viewers for whom the essential Americanness of the production, and the shallowness of the Chinese cultural setting, will be more glaringly evident.

The “Spark” Mentorships & Grants Program is being launched to encourage individuals, entrepreneurs, small businesses and non-profits to apply with their new tourism ideas for the region – more important than ever as the tourism industry begins its renewal and recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Applications will be accepted begin immediately and until Oct. 30.

“We’re all about sparking news tourism possibilities,” said Justin Lafontaine, program lead for the Ontario Tourism Innovation Lab that has partnered with Cornwall and SDG.

“Certainly we’ve all been through a challenging time, but at the same time there are new opportunities to expand and re-imagine local tourism.”

Article content During the kick-off event, the executive director also discussed the ways in which the way funds collected are tallied. Long gone, several years ago, is the familiar thermometer way of announcing the amount raised. It’s been replaced by what Labossière called an impact-based analysis of funding. The practice enables the organization to increase the impact it has on the many programs and agencies it assists. “A dollar to the United Way is spent in collaboration in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing cost-sharing expertise in building, together, this community we call home,” said Labossière. “We continue to fundraise, as dollars are vital to the survival of our partner agencies and are necessary to run the programs that we choose to fund. “We invest your money, right here in our community, where it is needed most.” More On This Topic United Way/Centraide of SD&G launches annual campaign United Way of SDG Community Campaign supporting more agencies United Way / Centraide of SDG in the black, adds new member agencies In all, the United Way of SDG pledged to invest $337,786 to the agencies it assists.

These included strategic partnerships the United Way of SDG had established over the last few years, such as with the Social Development Council of Cornwall and Area, as well as the 30 or so members of the Regional Emergency Response Council. In addition, she also praised the generosity of not only the citizens of Cornwall and SDG, but also of the city itself.

This included Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall and Area executive director Ron Graham, as well as John Hoyles, of Ontario 211. In addition, Steven Douris, himself a big brother with the organization, spoke to a local mother, who’s two children have benefited from the BBBS’ mentoring programs. Identified only as Maureen, the woman told listeners how both her daughter and her son were matched with mentors, which then allowed them to blossom in later years. “It’s unbelievable how much it has helped,” she said. “For my son, he’s been given healthy male role models which obviously I cannot be for him. My daughter is a bit shy and her big sister, and her big sister’s family, because they have all welcomed her into their home, they have brought her out of her shell.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

There were organically-grown vegetables for sale at Springfield, walking tours, a variety of other activities – and lots of interest in a work-in-progress café. McCarthy talked about the “field-to-table” experience and Springfield’s experimenting in different crops over the years. “Some have been very successful,” McCarthy said. “This year garlic was very successful here.” The Farm Hop event ran in two, two-hour blocks, late on Saturday morning and from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.

And after graduating from University of Guelph, and when Julia was living in the Woodstock area, she was milking cows in a rented barn there. Fifty cows were eventually moved from Woodstock to Jamink Farm, which had to get certified again as organic, and in 2013 it started shipping organic milk once again.

Article content My hometown could have looked very different today. Just after the Second World War in downtown Toronto, large swaths of late Victorian buildings were demolished to put up the Gardiner Expressway and construction began on what is now a cement and steel celebration of height in office towers and condominium buildings. And then, in 1965 a most spectacular 64 years-old stone and marble homage to money was demolished for what is now the iconic Toronto Dominion Centre, a full block of sleek black glass and steel anchoring Bay Street in the psyche of our nation.

Saving and protecting SDG's rural heritage, one old barn at a time Back to video A cemetery of sorts for the Corinthian columns of this dismantled Bank of Toronto building plundered for the modernist ground-breaking design was created along the Scarborough Bluffs, a park now popular for wedding photos. In 1972, two men took a road trip around Ontario and Quebec to document barns. One man was Eric Arthur a professor of architecture at the University of Toronto and a Companion of the Order of Canada. The other man was Dudley Witney photographer and writer.

Article content At a time in Toronto when architecture was focused on topping this sleek beauty of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s TD Bank Complex and the pending start to the CN Tower they set out to study the humble barn. The product of their quest was The Barn: A Vanishing Landmark in North America. The first sentences of their introduction to the book summarizes the motivation for these two men to seek out the agricultural structures which are a beacon to rural life: “Is it possible that millions now living in North America have never seen a barn, let alone been in one. In the foreseeable future, there is more than a possibility that, for many, the kind of barn illustrated in these pages will not be there to see. When one considers the exposure of our old barns to the winds of change,… the marvel is that any are left for those who would try to comprehend the secrets that they hold.” Possibly in rural communities, the ordinary barn does not hold the extraordinary draw it does for city-folk like us. If you were to ask us why we chose Apple Hill to live and work on our organic farm it is most definitely because we fell in love with our stone house and the three barns and not necessarily in that order. At Springfield Farm, we are fortunate to have three examples of barn architecture from the large dairy barn, the mid-sized Drive Shed and the smaller shingled Chicken Coop. While my barn-love went immediately to the large dairy barn, it is the Drive Shed that holds the most promise for our future operation as an AgriTourism destination and equally as an outstanding example of barn architecture having withstood well over 100 years of use and weather.

Article content There is something awe-inspiring in standing inside these barns and looking upwards at the hand-chiseled beams and trusses. One can imagine the day that the barn was raised and the men that climbed precariously to lift each truss in place without the assistance of modern machinery and safety precautions. In South Glengarry, the go-to barn restorers are Hamelin’s Restoration and co-owner Bob Hamelin provided his insights on barns in our region during a recent interview: “From the point of view of someone who has had the privilege of being part of several barn preservation projects in SDG over the last 24 years, in and around Glengarry, my brother and I have earned the reputation of being the old barn brothers. We regularly receive calls to come have a look at an old barn or granary to give our humble opinion on its condition. I never pass up the opportunity to visit a neighbour who has concerns about his aging barn. Usually the conversation starts with we would like to save it, but we aren’t sure it’s worth it…” Barns were a must have for our ancestors in Glengarry. For me it was my grandparents. They needed their barn to survive and to feed their family. The barn was part of the family, it was part of daily life. They stuck with it through the good times and the hard times. Part of the enjoyment I get when visiting a barn is piecing together the story it tells — changes that were made over the years, efforts to patch up damage when money was scarce, ingenious methods to hold something up when you could only use what you had available on hand, renovations made to accommodate new equipment when you had a good year… It reminds me that I’m not the first to work on the barn and hopefully not the last.

Article content A testimony to the respect an old barn can inspire is when I think back about some of the most extensive restoration projects I have done with clients from the city, Montreal or Toronto, who purchased property in SDG. Several of them confided in me that if there hadn’t been an old barn on the property, they probably wouldn’t have bought it. Funny thing — these people had very little use for the barn, but they were so impressed with the structure, and they imagined the history behind it, and they imagined that maybe one day they would use it for something too…They were convinced it was worth it. I feel we should save our last barns — it is worth it. For me saving doesn’t necessarily mean a full restoration, saving could just mean hiring a qualified person to patch the roof, or brace a failing timber, fix a section of crumbling stone wall… Just care enough to save it for the time being. Who knows what the future holds, you might need that barn yet! And Hamelin’s perspective is shared by Stratford Architect, Krista Hulshof Duynisveld, Veld Architecture Firm and Co-Founder, Ontario Barn Preservation Society when she states: “Barns contribute to our cultural rural heritage landscape. They are important and iconic landmarks in the countryside. Much like in the UK, where your mind’s picture is that of small farms, with brown brick buildings and hedge rows, barns are part of their preservation plan to maintain their iconic landscape. They contribute to agritourism. Their simple shape and form is so embedded in our culture that we teach children that a barn looks like a red heritage barn, not a long low modern barn!”

Article content There is a lot to learn about the vernacular development of communities. The barn types and construction tell us a lot about the heritage of the people there. I think this type of research can really contribute to the revitalization of rural communities. The ecology of settlement, and construction is fascinating. It makes me very sad when one (barn) goes missing as I drive familiar routes. I feel a hole in the landscape where it no longer stands. They are disappearing faster than I would like, that is why, despite my time constraints with a small family and growing architecture practice, I couldn’t wait any longer to start the Ontario Barn Preservation group and begin an inventory of barns across Ontario. Thankfully, in South Glengarry, as well as in the rest of SDG, there is growing support and interest for the preservation and re-purposing of barns. Through the COVID-lens, the opportunity is upon us as a community to collect an inventory of our barns, those with significant heritage or purpose, those with owners who are concerned for the future of their barns and those that possibly could be moved to a local park area and preserved for generations to come. We should not want to miss an opportunity to become an AgriTourism destination with the added attraction of hosting barn tours and heritage talks. And, as a community we should be cautioned by Toronto’s tale of demolishing the artistry of their buildings for the cause of modernization. Are we rural or urban? Why not make your next COVID-19 project a Sunday drive down memory lane and through our beautiful fall countryside to find that barn worth saving! M. Eleanor McGrath is a member of the Standard-Freeholder’s community editorial board.

The event underscored that accelerating ocean-based solutions can support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and delivery of the SDGs.

According to the UN Global Compact’s Ocean Stewardship 2030 report released in May 2020, five tipping points could secure a healthy and productive ocean. These are:

Fully traceable sustainable seafood;

Decarbonized shipping (“set sail for zero”);

Harnessing ocean electricity;

Mapping the ocean; and

Ending waste entering the ocean.

During the review event, five CEO Roundtables addressed these tipping points. The review resulted in an Outcome Document of the 2020 CEO Roundtables on Ocean, identifying actions business can take to advance the five areas. On sustainable seafood, the outcome document recommends: contributing to standardize traceability data, harmonize standards and promote interoperability of traceability platforms through the seafood value chain; and increasing the recognition of seafood in the climate and food agendas.



On decarbonizing shipping, recommendations include: providing incentives to develop and scale up low- or zero-carbon fuels, and support transparency and financial capacity; engaging with governments and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in setting up a global research and development fund and calling for further policy action; and sharing best practices regarding technology for zero-emission vessels.



On harnessing ocean energy, the document highlights action areas related to: developing a framework for global strategic planning by governments, in dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and increasing standardization of the industry and setting up global certifications and key performance indicators.

On ending waste entering the ocean, the document calls for: defining the “rules of the game” such as through dependable regulations for the private sector, to facilitate greater public-private collaboration to end ocean plastic; and determining the institutions needed to rapidly scale plastic pollution solutions across countries, as well as funding them.



On mapping the ocean, the outcome document recommends: conducting a gap analysis to take stock of ongoing ocean data initiatives, and data and information needs; and identifying enabling factors and the necessary means to implement them, including support for developing countries, in collecting, sharing, and using ocean data.

On delivering on the Decade of Action, participants identified barriers and actions for business and governments to realize the ambitions highlighted in the Ocean Stewardship 2030 report. SDG 14 (life below water) addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Four of the targets of SDG 14 are due to be achieved by 2020.

290,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-implementation-and-accountability-bring-on-the-data/,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Implementation and Accountability: Bring on the Data,"Next week the UN will hold a virtual UN World Data Forum, featuring the expertise of statisticians and sustainable development professionals from around the world. The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

291,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/experts-discuss-success-factors-in-regulating-lead-in-paint/,"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Experts Discuss Success Factors in Regulating Lead in Paint,"The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance) held a webinar for policymakers on eliminating lead in paint through regulatory action. The Lead Paint Alliance is a voluntary partnership formed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent exposure to lead by promoting the phase-out of paints containing lead.

The Alliance is a voluntary global public/private partnership, modeled on the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles. Its goal is to see lead paint laws established in every country; only 40% of countries currently have such laws. The Alliance promotes government efforts to develop a legal limit on lead in paint using UNEP’s Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint, which governments requested, and industry and NGOs supported. The Model Law provides for a 90 ppm lead limit in paint, and is adaptable to each country’s regulatory framework.

The 5 October 2020 webinar focused on information for government policymakers considering the development of a lead paint law, or in the process of developing one, and for stakeholders engaged in that process.

Elena Jardan, WHO, stressed that: lead is harmful at all exposure levels; no therapy can reverse its effects on brain development and the cardiovascular system; and 90 ppm is the lowest maximum level of lead content currently required by any country. She said this limit is technically feasible given that non-lead-based pigments, dryers, and anti-corrosives are widely available for oil-based paints, and are used by many manufacturers to produce high-quality paints. She said the 90 ppm limit promotes trade since it is becoming an accepted international standard, and is already used in several countries including Canada, China, Kenya, Nepal, the Philippines, Tanzania, and the US. She added that lead content can potentially be much lower than 90 ppm by sourcing uncontaminated raw materials ingredients.

On the status of lead paint laws globally, Desiree Raquel Narvaez, UNEP, reported that:

Since September 2018, five countries (Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Israel and Pakistan) have passed/strengthened lead paint legislation;

12 more countries are in the final stages of drafting lead paint laws;

Two paint producer countries (Jordan and Ecuador) have finished the reformulation process and can now produce lead-free paint; and

Many companies are engaged in the reformulation process.

Narvaez also highlighted the SAICM Global Environment Facility (GEF) project’s lead in paint component, which she said is currently assisting 61 countries.

Outlining the benefits of lead paint laws, Amanda Rawls, American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative (ABA-ROLI), said they incentivize a range of actions, including: manufacturers to reformulate paints; ingredient suppliers to produce more and better non-lead ingredients; and importers to purchase and sell paints that comply with the the law. She said national laws create a fair market for all paint manufacturers, importers and exporters, and harmonized laws reduce trade barriers. She said the steps towards adopting a lead paint law include determining: lead concentration limits and to which paint products the law will apply; when the limit becomes mandatory; how manufacturers and importers can demonstrate compliance; which government agency will be responsible for enforcement; and penalties for non-compliance.

Jardan noted two ways to test compliance: collection of samples sent to a laboratory for analysis; and portable analysis using high-definition x-ray fluorescence. She said methods differ in complexity, limit of detection and cost, and that increasing demand for laboratory testing creates a market.

Michael Cofield, US Department of Commerce, suggested that governments work with the private sector to determine phased-in effective dates for the 90 ppm limit. This enables industry to change practices to comply with the limit, and to determine how it will obtain testing. It also enables government to encourage in-country laboratories to acquire the necessary equipment, expertise, and accreditation to perform testing.

Providing the perspective of the paint and coatings industry, Steven Sides, World Coatings Council (WCC), said government restrictions on lead can gain industry support when they: integrate technical reformulation guidance; address the problem of available laboratory capacity and testing; give industry laboratories a role in compliance verification; embrace a harmonized approach; and ensure national producers have access to international markets. He said the Lead Paint Alliance will advance when stakeholders acknowledge that different legal instruments can be used to eliminate lead from paint, that the existence of different residual limits does not compromise the effectiveness of lead use restrictions, and that different test methods yield similar effectiveness.

To showcase best practices in reformulation to achieve the 90 ppm lead in paint, he said the SAICM GEF Project is working with industry in targeted countries. He reported that 30 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were selected in China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, and Peru for industrial pilot tests on paint reformulation, using draft technical guidelines developed by Siberia’s National Cleaner Production Centre. Workshops took place in China, Jordan, and Peru to engage respective governments and the paint industry.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

This year’s work will include negotiating the 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of the UN’s operational activities for development (QCPR).

On 5 October 2020, the Committee, chaired by the Permanent Representative of Nepal, held an in-person session to adopt its programme of work for the year. The Committee also began its general debate on the theme of ‘Building back better after COVID-19: Ensuring a more equitable global economy, inclusive societies and sustainable recovery.’

We must take full advantage of the improvements we have made to the UN development system, to help countries recover better from COVID-19.

The Chair said the Committee will focus on issues affecting groups of countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). He also highlighted:

the Food Systems Summit being planned for 2021,

the Committee will discuss the modalities for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028, through a high-level event convening from 22-24 March 2023, in New York, and

it is time to conduct the QCPR, which takes place every four years and was last conducted in 2016.

In a keynote address to the Second Committee, Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, said the international community cannot squeeze water from a stone: developing economies and emerging markets cannot find financial resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic without significant debt restructuring. He expressed support for the issuance of special drawing rights.

Stiglitz also called for multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes, such as by creating a minimum global corporate income tax at the level of 2%. He added that greening economies can be timely, targeted, labor-intensive, and provide good stimulus.

Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said COVID-19 stimulus packages will be most effective if they prioritize public investments that contribute to achieving the SDGs, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and digital infrastructure.

Member States speaking during the debate emphasized the need for stronger international cooperation to face the “seemingly endless cycles” of COVID-19, especially in States that lack recovery financing. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged “vaccine multilateralism” to ensure equitable, universal, and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Another delegate suggested considering vaccines and therapeutic treatments as global public goods.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) noted some government’s “retreat” from the development agenda and climate change commitments. She also noted the inability of SIDS to access available climate finance because of “cumbersome processes and competition with other better capacitated countries.”

Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) said “there should be no rollback of existing commitments,” and it is vital to promote full participation of people with disabilities, women and children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. He supported new approaches to addressing the debt crisis and maintain jobs, particularly in the LDCs. The general debate continues until 9 October 2020 in a virtual format.

Also during the Second Committee’s in-person meeting on 5 October, UN Deputy Secretary‑General Amina Mohammed’s provided a briefing on the 2020 QCPR, noting that it takes place at the outset of the Decade of Action for sustainable development.

Recalling that the previous QCPR in 2016 “paved the way for the deepest transformation in the history” of the UN development system, Mohammed reported that the UN has since established a new coordination system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda, including a funding compact with Member States. In May 2020, during the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, she said governments decided to move forward on other mandates set out in the 2016 QCPR, including to operationalize a new regional architecture, strengthen support to multi‑country offices (MCOs), and bolster independent system‑wide evaluations for accountability.

Mohammed said that now, to help countries recover better from COVID-19, “we must take full advantage of the improvements we have made” to the UN development system. She called on Member States to give strategic direction to this process through the 2020 QCPR, particularly in the following ways:

Additional resources are needed in priority policy areas, including climate change, economic transformation and employment, women’s empowerment, and digitalization;

At the country level, the UN is introducing integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs, and the QCPR can provide clarity on expectations;

Coherence between the UN’s pillars;

On leaving no one behind, the QCPR “can give visibility to those excluded and on the margins,” including persons with disabilities and women and girls. She said the process can also clarify Member States’ expectations for a recovery from COVID‑19 that is anchored in inclusive and green economies, and noted that greater investment is needed in data for evidence‑based decision‑making; and

Completing the “unfinished business” of the 2016 QCPR, such as meeting the targets of the funding compact.

In addition to deliberations on its official agenda items, the Committee will hold three other events. A joint meeting with ECOSOC will address ‘Developing sustainable infrastructure and utilizing science and technology in response to COVID-19,’ on 14 October. A virtual side event on ‘Disaster risk-informed and resilient COVID-19 recovery’ will take place on 15 October. An annual dialogue with the executive secretaries of the UN regional commissions is scheduled for 19 October.

Action on draft resolutions is expected to take place in November.

294,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wto-members-advance-text-negotiations-on-fisheries-subsidies/,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WTO Members Advance Text Negotiations on Fisheries Subsidies,"World Trade Organization (WTO) members began work on a consolidated draft document towards an agreement on curbing harmful fisheries subsidies. Members reviewed draft language on subsidies contributing to overcapacity and overfishing, subsidies to distant water fishing, transparency provisions, and special and differential treatment of developing and least developed countries (LDCs).

The Negotiating Group on Rules convened a cluster of meetings from 14-18 September. Participants attended meetings, technical discussions, and informal consultations, led by Negotiating Group Chair, Ambassador Santiago Wills (Colombia), in person and via virtual connections.

On overcapacity and overfishing, members discussed whether and how to ban subsidies for fishing outside one’s waters or beyond waters regulated by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Proponents argued such a provision would prevent countries from irresponsible exploitation of the high seas while others said international treaties allow fishing in areas beyond national jurisdictions (ABNJ). Some members with smaller fishing fleets said they would like “room to grow their fishing capacities.” Members also discussed how to determine which developing countries and LDCs would be allowed to maintain subsidies for fishing in their own waters, including consideration of proposed criteria such as annual catch volumes and national income to determine exemptions. Some members expressed concern that these criteria would send the “wrong message” about protection of marine health. One member suggested including a placeholder for a transition period for developing country members to comply with subsidy prohibitions.

Members also discussed whether and how to allow governments to maintain subsidies, such as for fishers to buy boats and fuel, if governments can demonstrate that they have policies in place to ensure the health of their fish stocks. Some members said this provision lowers the ambition of the agreement. Others said the mandate for the negotiations is only to eliminate subsidies where harm is observed. A few members underscored the importance of assuring the biological sustainability of the fish stock.

On notification, transparency and surveillance, eight members introduced a proposal to replace the placeholder in the Chair’s draft text. Proponents said the provision will help members check on each other’s implementation of subsidy curbs. Other members opposed replacing the text, preferring to make progress on the subsidy prohibitions first, while others reiterated concerns about the burden for developing countries that may not have the capacity to comply with notification requirements.

The Chair noted the 2020 deadline for concluding talks, acknowledging that some members had urged concluding negotiations by the end of 2020, in line with SDG target 14.6.

The report is presented as an interactive portal and features 100 “data stories” from around the world.

The report titled, ‘The World’s Women 2020: Trends and Statistics,’ was launched on 20 October 2020 – World Statistics Day, which is marked once every five years. The report seeks to answer the question, “What do data tell us about progress towards the commitments made in the Beijing Platform for Action” 25 years after its adoption?

The report uses statistics to analyze the state of gender equality around the world in six areas. On economic empowerment, the report finds that unpaid domestic and care work has intensified for both men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic, but women globally still spend about three times as many hours on unpaid domestic and care work as men (4.2 hours compared to 1.7).

This restricts women’s participation in the labor market; in 2020, only 47% of women of working age participated in the labor market, compared to 74% of men, and the authors report that this gender gap that has remained relatively constant since 1995. The pandemic is “expected to exacerbate these gender disparities, as many women work in the subsectors hardest hit by COVID-19 and lockdown measures, including in paid domestic work, accommodation and food services, and the retail trade,” the report suggests.

On power and decision making, the data show that women held only 28% of managerial positions globally in 2019, which is almost the same proportion as in 1995. In addition, only 18% of enterprises surveyed had a female Chief Executive Officer in 2020, and that percentage drops to 7.4% for Fortune 500 corporations.

On education, the report finds that girls and boys are participating equally in primary education in most regions of the world. In tertiary education, women outnumber men, and enrollment is increasing faster for women than for men.

On violence against women and girls, an estimated 137 women are killed by their intimate partner or a family member every day. In the past 12 months, 18% of women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner.

The other two areas for analysis in the report are population and families, and health. The authors also consider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report is presented on an online portal, including an interactive map to find stories by region, and datasets organized by the six thematic areas.

The study provides 21 recommendations on amplifying the “substantially muted voices of women” in COVID-19 news coverage.

The study titled, ‘The Missing Perspectives of Women in COVID-19 News: A special report on women’s under-representation in news media,’ released in September 2020, focuses on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, UK, and US. It draws on a computational news content analysis of 11,913 publications and 1.9 million stories between 1 March and 15 April 2020, as well as a mix of other quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

The study finds that in the six countries analyzed, women are effectively political invisible in COVID-19-related decision-making processes. Moreover, in times of crisis, journalists may revert back to “established sources” who are significantly more likely to be men. The study finds that every individual woman’s voice in the news on COVID-19 is “drowned out by the voices of at least three, four, or five men.”

The findings reveal not just how many women are represented in COVID-19 news, but also how they are portrayed in the story. The author explains that the women who are given a platform in the COVID-19 story are “rarely portrayed as authoritative experts or as empowered individuals but more frequently as sources of personal opinion or as victims/people affected by the disease.” Women constituted 19% of experts while men constituted 77% in the 175 most highly ranked COVID-19 articles across the six countries.

In addition, few women feature as “protagonists” in COVID-19 news coverage, even less so than in news not related to COVID-19. The absence of women’s perspectives in COVID-19 news means that women have limited influence over the framing of the crisis. This results in limited influence over policymaking directions, and thus further marginalization within societies.

Recommendations to redress the bias include steps to focus on women as sources of expertise and protagonists, cover gender equality, consider the implications of the framing of stories, and seek to understand the implications of reporting on women’s lives.

The study is authored by Luba Kassova, international audience strategy consultancy AKAS Ltd. This report is the precursor to an expanded publication on the entire news value chain, commissioned in support of UN Women’s Generation Equality Forum. The expanded study will offer a gender parity checklist for news providers around the world.

This is especially true for the world’s forests.

Forests have a key role to play in helping to achieve many of the SDGs, from mitigating climate change by acting carbon sinks to providing food, livelihoods, fuel, shelter, and clean water.

However, the forest sector has an image problem.

In many places around the world, forests are seen as something to be set aside for conservation. Many communication campaigns around forests contain sweeping shots showing forests as great swathes of green – exactly what the public does not want to see cut down. The buzz of a chainsaw in this context would make many people recoil.

But to say that there is a vital difference between sustainably managing forests and indiscriminate logging would be an understatement.

The challenge is to communicate this to the general public and to change this deep-seated way of thinking about forests. We need to improve understanding of the sustainable use of forests for diverse purposes not only for the benefit of billions of people, including some of the world’s most vulnerable, but also as an elemental means of protecting forests themselves.

As the world focuses on building back better in the aftermath of COVID-19, this communication challenge is more pressing than ever. Forests – and forest products – can help tackle climate change and reach sustainability goals and should be included in recovery plans as we design a new normal.

The pandemic is also a moment in history when people are more conscious of how important forest products are in our daily lives. During the crisis, forest products have been at the forefront of providing hygiene products and other supplies for personal protective equipment, biomass for energy, and ethanol for cleaning, as well as packaging for food and parcels.

COVID-19 has also brought about a shift in consumer attitudes and behavior as people reassess their priorities. In a survey by consulting firm McKinsey, almost two-thirds of consumers surveyed have made significant changes to their lifestyle to reduce their environmental impact. More than 60% report starting to recycle and buying products in environmentally friendly packaging. A vast majority of respondents say more attention should be paid to reducing pollution – something wood products can achieve by replacing plastic alternatives.

We need to use this window of opportunity to turn perceptions of sustainable forestry and forest products around.

After all, there is a powerful “sustainable wood” story to tell, because science and innovation are pushing the boundaries of what we can do with wood products, from construction to medicine, as well as replacing fossil fuel-based products with products from renewable sources. We have a great opportunity to form a persuasive narrative about solutions, to rethink our development paths, to reduce our carbon footprint, and to work together on solving the economic, biodiversity, and climate change crises.

What can we do to ensure that we do not miss our chance to reframe the forest sector and sustainable forest products?

First, we need to ensure our messaging is consistent. Governments, international organizations, and the private sector need to work together to promote the understanding of topical forestry issues in order to strengthen sustainable forest management in policy and practice.

Second, we need to showcase the innovations that use wood as a valid, affordable, and renewable alternative to fossil-derived products.

Third, we need to transform and simplify a complex and abstract agenda into human stories. We need to make our message relevant to people’s everyday lives and what they can do personally to help build a better world.

Finally, we need to explain better the truth that so many people have yet to grasp: how and why sustainable wood products, rather than causing deforestation, actually contribute to keeping forests and ecosystems healthy, while helping to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. As the proverb holds, “fact is fact, but perception is reality.”

As people re-evaluate their lives as a result of direct and indirect implications of COVID-19, we have a rare opportunity to make forestry a meaningful part of the solution. Let us not waste it.

The report aims to help countries align their development pathways with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies that promote climate resilience of food and water systems, energy, transport, and cities, among other sectors.

The report titled, ‘World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization,’ highlights the “huge risks” climate change poses to countries’ long-term development and growth, with critical implications for poverty, food security, and health. In a foreword, Juergen Voegele, World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, cautions that all countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, are now facing “the compound impacts of the twin challenges” of climate change and COVID-19.

The report notes that the ambition reflected in the first round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) would only limit global warming to 2.7-3.7°C above preindustrial levels. It warns that a continued focus on short- and medium-term targets could make decarbonization more difficult, and calls for long-term strategies to help countries develop sustainably. “By planning ahead, these strategies can boost new economic activity and innovations, creating the jobs of the future, while also securing a safer climate, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable,” said Mari Pangestu, World Bank’s Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, at the report’s launch.

The Outlook 2050 recognizes the need for a “bold economic transformation” to realize the vision of the Paris Agreement and make the SDGs “more achievable,” which includes aligning finance flows with low-emissions, climate-resilient development pathways. It proposes a “whole-of-economy” approach to decarbonization, which prioritizes four economy-wide strategic directions:

Embed long-term climate priorities in countries’ macroeconomic frameworks;

Embed long-term climate planning in national budgets and expenditure frameworks;

Embed long-term climate objectives in financial sector regulations and incentives; and

Embed long-term climate objectives in systems planning.

The report identifies cross-sectoral opportunities and makes recommendations across eight areas that are essential for achieving the SDGs: 1) transforming food systems; 2) protecting land-based ecosystems and carbon sinks; 3) transforming energy systems; 4) transforming mobility; 5) building low-carbon, more resilient urban areas; 6) transforming water systems; 7) transforming the ocean economy; and 8) digital transformation. The Outlook 2050 finds that investing in cross-sectoral opportunities, including as part of stimulus packages, can aid in a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report was launched on 24 June, during the ‘Kickstarting the Sustainable Recovery’ event series, organized by the World Bank’s Climate Change Group in partnership with Innovate4Climate. The series focused on the role of sustainable finance in the COVID-19 recovery to help countries “build back better and stronger.” [Publication: World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization] [Publication Landing Page] [World Bank Press Release]","The World Bank has published a report that outlines economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Participants endorsed the Geneva Declaration of Mayors, which aligns city leaders’ efforts with the initiative of UN Secretary-General António Guterres to “build back better” and turn the COVID-19 recovery into a real opportunity for shaping a healthy and resilient future.

The Forum, the first of its kind, took place on 6 October 2020 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and virtually. It convened under the theme, ‘City Action for a Resilient Future: Strengthening Local Government Preparedness and Response to Emergencies and the Impact of Disasters and Climate Change.’

Mayors and city leaders from the UNECE region (Europe, North America, Central Asia, and Caucasus) exchanged innovative ideas and efforts to address the COVID-19 emergency and, simultaneously, combat climate change and move towards achieving the SDGs. They highlighted the need for enhanced cooperation to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development since implementation takes place at the local level.

Describing the COVID-19 pandemic as “an unprecedented emergency,” the Geneva Declaration of Mayors indicates that the pandemic has taught us that rapid change of urban reality is possible, behavior patterns can be adapted, and humans can stand in solidarity for a common cause. The Mayors of the UNECE region aspire to:

strengthen the resilience of cities, by increasing the ability to anticipate, manage, and recover from any future emergency, and by creating environments that improve the physical, mental, and environmental health of communities;

take ambitious climate action, accelerating the transition to carbon neutrality and focusing on climate change adaptation;

make cities greener by promoting urban biodiversity, creating opportunities for urban micro-farming, and tackling food waste;

accelerate the transition to sustainable energy while improving the energy efficiency of cities and promoting high-performance buildings;

ensure that urban transport is sustainable through the design of appropriate transport systems that enhances their resilience and preparedness, and the promotion of safe, secure, green, healthy, and affordable smart mobility solutions;

ensure that housing is affordable, healthy, and adequate, actively tackling the undersupply of affordable housing, mounting urban poverty, and homelessness, as well as improving access to healthy and good quality housing;

make cities more equitable and inclusive by guaranteeing equal rights and participation for all, ensuring that women fully participate in political decision making, and ensuring that contingency plans respond to the needs of different population groups; and

turn these aspirations into reality using the Forum of Mayors as a platform for mutual learning, spreading the word, tracking progress, and achieving a multiplier effect through urban networks.

The Forum convened as part of the UNECE Sustainable Cities Week, a series of events aiming to strengthen cooperation between national and local governments. Running from 5-9 October, the Week also includes a day devoted to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), the 81st Session of the Committee on Urban Development, Housing and Land Management, and the fifth annual meeting of the United for Smart Sustainable Cities (UN4CC) Initiative, which brings together 17 UN agencies and programmes to achieve SDG 11.

Fewer natural disasters, a more stable climate, healthier people, and stronger economies are just some of the benefits that we stand to gain from helping forests to thrive.

But do we know enough about the world’s forests to take care of them properly?

There is growing international concern over the quality and availability of training and education needed both to prepare those whose daily work and decisions most closely impact the sustainable management of forests, and to inform new generations who will look after forest resources in the future.

We can only guess at how many children these days dream of being a forester when they grow up – likely too few. For the sake of our forests, we have to turn this situation around.

We need talented students to enter forest education programmes. We need well-trained forest managers and policymakers. We need to provide more opportunities for informal training and continuing education for forest communities and forest owners and businesses. And we need to reach the broader public.

After all, there is important work to do.

Internationally agreed targets for improving lives and protecting the planet recognize the vital importance of forests, which provide livelihoods for over a billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures.

SDG 15, for one, aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Other SDGs, such as those concerned with clean water (SDG 6) and the elimination of hunger and poverty (SDGs 2 and 1), depend to a great extent on the sustainable management of forests and urban green spaces.

To ensure that forests fulfil their potential in helping to achieve many development goals, including SDG 13 (climate action), we need to enrich forest education and inspire a new generation of forest managers. This is no easy task.

Heads of forestry from across the world are meeting online for the 25th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Committee on Forestry and 7th World Forest Week. Here, FAO and international partners are unveiling details of an assessment of forest education being conducted across six regions.

The first of its kind, the survey will gather comprehensive information on where, how, and how well forest education is being taught, from primary and secondary schools to technical and vocational institutions and universities.

The survey (open for responses until 31 October) is part of an ambitious project led by FAO, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO). The project, funded by the German government, aims to enhance forest education at national and local levels, and to address the considerable deficiencies in forest education in many parts of the world.

There are several ways we can try to achieve this. Providing easy access to information on forest education and to learning materials, including through web-based platforms, will expand the opportunities of forest-related learning to a far wider audience.

And instilling young children with an appreciation of forests, the many benefits they bring, and the need to manage them sustainably is also key to inspiring the next generation of foresters.

For this last reason, Germany is also supporting an FAO project to bring targeted forest education to schoolchildren aged 9-12, starting with a pilot lesson series tailored for Tanzania and the Philippines. The interactive lessons are designed to help children understand how forests help combat climate change and contribute to food security, lives, and livelihoods.

Forests are the most biologically diverse ecosystems on land, home to the majority of terrestrial species of animals and plants. If forest education remains insufficient, outdated, and deteriorating in many places, we will struggle to keep pace with changing societal demands on forests and increasing pressures on forest resources.

We need to improve forest education – and more widely, public understanding of forests and forestry – to help to prepare current and future generations to do a better job of protecting land and water resources, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.

The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.

Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”

Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.

The UNGA’s Third Committee (social, humanitarian, and cultural issues) is considering a draft resolution on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/C.3/75/L.9).

A website for the campaign from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint provides resources for raising awareness and regulatory action.

Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

The manufacture and sale of lead paint is still permitted in over 60% of countries, and is a source of lead exposure, especially for children and workers. Young children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure because lead affects the developing brain, potentially resulting in reduced intellectual ability. Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

Eliminating lead paint will help achieve SDG targets 3.9 (substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030) and 12.4 (by 2020, achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, and significantly reducing their release to air, water and soil to minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment).

ILPPW 2020 will take place from 25-31 October 2020, engaging governments, civil society organizations, health partners, and industry, all of whom are organizing campaigns throughout the week of action. ILPPW aims to: raise awareness about health effects of lead exposure; highlight the efforts of countries and partners to prevent led exposure, particularly in children; and urge further action to eliminate lead paint through country-level regulatory action.

The ILPPW website provides a range of materials to support campaign activities have been developed by the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance). These include infographics, posters, web banners, graphics, and a social media kit. It also includes a list and description of registered events, as well as fact sheets, Questions and Answers, resources on the risk of lead and lead paint, and ways to eliminate lead in paint.

Thus far, registered events during ILPPW 2020 will take place in Australia, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam. Registered activities include rallies, drama and dance, school programmes, and media and advocacy events, including lobbying activities for national legislation on lead-free paint.

The various events aim to, inter alia:

strengthen or enforce existing lead paint laws;

increase consumer awareness about the health and environmental impacts of lead exposure, including on children;

increase public awareness and support for eliminating lead paint;

ensure draft lead paint laws are supported by stakeholders;

encourage implementation of new lead paint laws;

urge the paint industry to stop using lead-based ingredients in paints;

develop safe school standards without lead paint on buildings;

increase industry support to phase out the addition of lead to paint; and

convince policymakers and regulators to begin work on developing a law to eliminate lead paint.

Established in 2011, ILPPW is an initiative of the Lead Paint Alliance, which is jointly led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Alliance promotes the global phase-out of lead paint through establishing legally binding measures to stop the manufacture, import, export, distribution, sale and use of lead paints in every country.

The researchers divide the suggested interventions into three focus areas:

On the farm—including training for farmers, developing climate-resilient crops, and improving livestock feed (USD 9 billion);

Food on the move—ensuring food can get from the farm to market, through investments in storage, transport, and other infrastructure (USD 2 billion); and

Empower the excluded— measures to ensure the poorest are included, such as steps regarding social protection spending or training for rural youth (USD 3 billion).

This Ceres2030 project was led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The researchers used two interlinked research approaches to develop their findings. The first involved the development of a machine-learning tool to analyze over 500,000 published reports and articles. This tool helped the team of 78 researchers from 23 countries to summarize the evidence from over 20 years of agricultural development literature. The second part of the research involved economic modelling. The researchers created a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how much it would cost to end hunger, increase incomes and protect the climate by 2030.

The proposed additional USD 14 billion per year until 2030 would represent a doubling in the amount of aid currently given for food security and nutrition each year. The researchers note that it must be accompanied by an additional USD 19 billion a year from low- and middle-income countries’ own budgets.

The research findings support an integrated approach, recognizing that “agricultural interventions are more effective with a population that enjoys at least a minimum level of income, education, with access to networks and resources such as extension services and robust infrastructure.” The research also revealed that it is more effective to create integrated portfolios of interventions rather than to support improvements in isolation from one another.

Regarding women’s empowerment, the researchers indicate that the evidence base is sparse, due to the fact that only 10% of the papers reviewed considered gender differences in the outcomes of the interventions.

The researchers organize their 10 key recommendations for donor governments based on the three focus areas for interventions, as follows.

Empower the excluded:

Support participation in farmers’ organizations

Invest in vocational programs for rural youth that offer integrated-training in multiple skills

Scale up social protection programs to help create a bridge for people living in poverty to find productive jobs

On the Farm:

Invest in information and training, particularly for women, to increase the uptake of new technologies

Ensure new environmentally-friendly farming methods are also economically viable

Support the adoption of climate-resilient crops

Increase research on how to help small-scale producers in water-scarce regions

Target improvements in the quantity and quality of livestock feed to small and medium-sized commercial farms

Food on the Move:

To reduce post-harvest losses, look beyond the storage of cereals to also focus on other food groups and other parts of the food value chain

Invest in the infrastructure, regulations, services and technical assistance needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that supply or buy from small-scale farmers

The findings from the review of literature were published by Nature Research in a new research collection of peer-reviewed journal articles.

306,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undrr-report-calls-for-improved-governance-to-address-systemic-risk/,"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDRR Report Calls for Improved Governance to Address “Systemic Risk”,"The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has published a report that finds extreme weather events, particularly climate-related disasters, have increased sharply over the last twenty years, resulting in more than a million deaths and nearly USD 3 trillion in economic losses.

The report titled, ‘The Human Cost of Disasters: An Overview of the Last 20 Years: 2000-2019,’ was issued on 13 October – the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The report serves as a reminder to countries of their commitments under the Sendai Framework, to enact national and local DRR strategies by 2020, and highlights the urgency of taking action on climate change.

The report finds that 7,348 major disaster events occurred between 2000-2019, killing 1.23 million and affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), and resulting in USD 2.97 trillion in economic losses. This represents an increase over the previous twenty-year period, during which 4,212 natural disasters killed 1.19 million and affected 3.25 billion people and caused USD 1.63 trillion in economic losses. A significant portion of the increase was driven by a rise in climate-related disasters, like extreme weather events such as floods and storms, which nearly doubled from 3,656 to 6,681. Shifting rainfall patterns and greater precipitation variability also contribute to the increase by placing the 70% of global agriculture that is rain fed, and 1.3 billion people dependent on it, at significant risk.

Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century.

The report recommends that countries improve disaster risk governance by strengthening vision, plans, guidelines, funding, and cross-sectoral coordination. While the report credits improvements to early warning systems and disaster preparedness and response for “a reduction in loss of life in single-hazard scenarios,” it highlights the “increasingly systemic nature of disaster risk.” Events’ overlap and interplay with other risk drivers, including poverty, climate change, population growth in hazard-exposed areas, uncontrolled urbanization, and biodiversity loss, expose the need to further strengthen disaster risk governance, the report notes. The report warns that inability to understand and manage systemic risk jeopardizes the achievement of the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.

To mark the International Day, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for DRR Mami Mizutori also held a public online conversation. The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote coherence between DRR and climate change adaptation in national strategies for DRR and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Espinosa stressed the need to enhance “efforts to address climate change and help build resilience to it.”

Mizutori called for “an integrated approach which recognizes the increasingly systemic nature of risk and how climate interacts with other drivers of risk.” “Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century,” she said.

307,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/global-farm-trade-talks-restart-amid-slow-sdg-2-progress-covid-19-fears/,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: Global Farm Trade Talks Restart Amid Slow SDG 2 Progress, COVID-19 Fears","Negotiations on agriculture at the World Trade Organization (WTO) have restarted under the guidance of a new chair, Costa Rica’s Ambassador Gloria Abraham-Peralta, amid growing fears that the COVID-19 crisis and economic slowdown will hamper progress on the food security aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In 2015, world leaders committed to “correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets” as part of SDG 2, the Sustainable Development Goal covering hunger, nutrition, food security, and sustainable agriculture. However, conflict, climate change, and persistent poverty and inequality have stymied progress since then, with rising numbers of hungry people among other troubling trends.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, new farm subsidy packages and food export restrictions have sparked concern among other WTO members, who fear their own producers and consumers may be harmed. Many trade officials regret that countries applying these measures have not shared information about them transparently, Abraham-Peralta said in remarks to a negotiating session she convened on 25 September.

The chair told delegates that farm subsidy reform – covered by WTO talks on “agricultural domestic support” – remains top of the agenda for most of the trade body’s members ahead of the Organization’s Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12). After the pandemic prompted Kazakhstan to postpone plans to hold the high-level event this summer, it is now tentatively slated for June 2021 instead.

“Domestic Support remains the priority for many delegations, even more so in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and the SDG goals,” Abraham-Peralta said in her report to delegates.

Farm Trade Outcome “A Must”

The chair also said it was essential that WTO members strike a deal on agriculture when ministers next meet.

“It is clear for all that an agricultural outcome at MC12 is a must to preserve the credibility of the organization in the years ahead,” her report to the meeting said.

In recent years, members have struggled to make progress in negotiations on the controversial area, despite striking a deal to end agricultural export subsidies at the WTO’s Nairobi ministerial conference in 2015 – an explicit component of SDG target 2b – and two years earlier agreeing a declaration on public food stockholding programmes and WTO farm subsidy rules when they met in Bali, Indonesia.

Trade ministers failed to reach any consensus agreement on agriculture when they met in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2017 – leaving the trade body with no clear roadmap on how talks should proceed.

The WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture mandates the continuation of negotiations in its Article 20 – but markets for food and farm goods have nonetheless changed immensely in the quarter century that has elapsed since the treaty entered into force.

Seven Negotiating Areas

Abraham-Peralta reported back on her consultations with delegations in the seven ongoing negotiating areas.

Three of these relate to areas on which rules exist already under the Agreement on Agriculture. These are: domestic support to agriculture, where agricultural exporting countries and most developing countries seek new commitments; market access, covering tariffs on farm goods and other similar border restrictions, where again exporters seek concessions from importing countries; and export competition, covering agricultural export subsidies and other measures seen as similar.

Four other topics are more recent. These include the question of trade in cotton, of particular concern to West African countries; food export restrictions, where importing countries in particular have raised concerns; public food stockholding, where certain developing countries favour greater flexibility under WTO farm subsidy rules; and the question of a new “special safeguard mechanism,” which developing countries would be able to use to raise tariffs temporarily in the event of a sudden import surge or price depression.

The chair told the meeting that she “did not detect any major shift” in countries’ negotiating positions, which she said had been captured well in the final report issued by her predecessor, Guyanan ambassador J.R. “Deep” Ford.

A Changing Trade Landscape

Rapid change in food and agricultural markets have upended efforts to rewrite the global rulebook on farm trade. In particular, the rise of China, India, and other “emerging” developing countries have led to rapid growth in South-South trade – and changed how key players see the talks. Many countries have also fast-tracked efforts to strike bilateral and regional trade deals – depriving WTO talks of the political impetus they need to move ahead.

However, some long-standing farm trade concerns can only be resolved through broad-based collective action, with the question of farm subsidy reform chief among them. The WTO’s Deputy Directory-General Alan Wolff recently underscored this point: “To date, there has not been a single regional or bilateral trade agreement that has tackled the issue of agricultural subsidies.”

The Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries have long been proponents of reform in this area – with the group including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, plus a dozen other members. The EU – whose subsidies were for decades a prime target of exporters– has taken successive steps to reform the support it provides, “decoupling” it from prices and production and seeking to shift payments towards rewarding producers for delivering environmental benefits. In contrast, the US continues to provide substantial levels of support linked directly to farm output, with recent subsidy packages aimed at compensating producers for the impact of the Trump Administration’s trade war with China, and more recently COVID-19-related disruption. Meanwhile, China and India have emerged as significant providers of agricultural support, prompting concerns from trading partners in both the developed and developing world who fear their own producers could be unfairly disadvantaged. The four WTO members together account for some three-quarters of all support classed as trade-distorting under the trade body’s current rules.

High tariffs on farm goods – especially “sensitive” products such as beef, dairy products or rice – remain another sore point in the talks. With Japan, Switzerland, and the EU among WTO members maintaining high levels of protection, exporting countries such as Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay would like to see trade barriers reduced and simplified in the talks.

Following the 2015 Nairobi deal to end agricultural export subsidies, WTO members such as the US are reluctant to pursue further talks in this area. However, some Cairns Group countries would like to see more done in areas where they consider more progress is needed – in particular on topics like export credits, food aid, and agricultural exporting state trade enterprises.

Meanwhile, India has spearheaded a push by the G-33 developing country coalition to ease WTO rules that require food purchased at government-set prices to count towards the trade body’s maximum permitted farm subsidy limits, when these purchases are part of public stockholding programmes for food security purposes. Proponents want a “permanent solution” to the issue, following a 2014 decision on the topic by the WTO’s General Council. Exporting countries, and some other developing countries, nonetheless fear that subsidised food purchases could undermine producer livelihoods and food security abroad if stocks end up being exported abroad. G-33 members include China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as well as over three dozen other countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.

The G-33 is also behind efforts to agree a new “special safeguard mechanism” to help developing countries shield producers from sudden import surges and price depressions. While exporting countries have agreed in principle to the talks in this area, they have nonetheless linked progress on the topic to efforts to improve market access for farm goods. The ensuing deadlock has meant WTO members’ negotiating positions remain far apart on this question.

One area where food importing countries such as Japan and Switzerland would like to see action is the issue of food export restrictions – a topic which has hit the headlines in recent months due to COVID-19. Numerous WTO members, fearing shortages, initially imposed bans or other limits on exports – although, with ample food stocks and robust farm output, many of these measures have since been lifted. Poor consumers in low-income food-importing countries are particularly vulnerable if export restrictions in major exporting countries cause world food prices to rise. WTO members are currently discussing options to improve transparency, and potentially also to exempt UN humanitarian food aid purchases from these measures.

Finally, cotton-producing countries in West Africa have long called for reform of farm subsidies that harm their producers by pushing down prices on world markets. While US cotton support schemes have been a particular focus of the talks in this area, Washington has argued that subsidies provided by China must also be part of any eventual deal.

Small Steps Forward?

Abraham-Peralta’s report to the meeting notes that some delegations see three successive time horizons for the talks: short term work; deliverables for MC12; and a post-MC12 work programme.

In the short term, the chair will appoint facilitators on specific negotiating topics to help her with her work. She also indicated she would convene small-group discussions in addition to meetings open to all members, while remaining committed to inclusiveness and transparency.

Negotiating meetings open to the full membership are now planned for 10 November and 7 December. Members would be able to re-evaluate the process she is leading by the year-end or in early 2021.

Such information enables policymakers to identify the systemic loss of a country’s economic potential, and revise budgets to support prevention and protection. SDG target 5.2 calls to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.”



The report estimates that 500,000 working days are lost to marital violence annually, as women exposed to domestic violence are typically less productive and tend to take more time off, resulting in an economic loss for them and the economy as a whole. Sexual violence can result in unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages and reproductive health issues.

Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The tool features case studies from Egypt, the UK, Viet Nam and Palestine. In Egypt, the study finds that approximately 5.6 million women experience violence at the hands of their husband or fiancé annually, and the cost for women and families due to violence is approximately LE 2.17 billion. The study reports that disseminating the findings has led to increased recognition of the impact of violence against women on the entire economy and increased advocacy, resulting in:

an increase in the Ministry of Planning’s budget for violence against women-related activities;

an increase in the number of female police officers; and

development of a new draft law on violence against women that is under consideration by parliament.

The UK case study finds that the total cost of domestic violence to society is approximately £23 billion, of which £3.1 billion is borne by the state through support to the criminal justice system, health system, social services, social housing, and legal aid bills to support victims. Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The case study on Viet Nam highlights how the survey results have contributed to increased awareness of the impact of domestic violence and enhanced service provision. UN Women and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have supported the Government of Viet Nam to pilot an ‘Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence,’ which features a referral system, health care and protection. The pilot also supports the police and criminal justice system to enhance services to survivors of domestic violence. Training has increased the expertise of government personnel and researchers working on domestic violence, positioning them to undertake future costing exercises, and to feature relevant questions in national statistical surveys.

A compilation of lessons learned from the case studies highlights key recommendations for conducting costing studies, given their potential impacts: devote enough time to the preparatory phase for a costing study, including engaging the government to ensure ownership of the findings and a commitment to implement recommendations; consider the study’s scope, including clear definitions of what is included and what age range is selected; employ innovative and participatory approaches, such as a case study of a particular service or area; design the questionnaire to ensure that the methodology is culturally appropriate; produce and disseminate robust estimates; and develop an advocacy plan and use the findings at the outset, such as developing an advocacy plan to target key government leaders and engaging the media to maximize dissemination of the findings and raise awareness among the public and policymakers.

In many parts of the world, autumn is the time to gather the harvest and count our blessings. This year’s trials and tribulations have taught us that while we can count on blessings bestowed by other humans to overcome the COVID-19 crisis, we are wholly dependent on blessings bestowed by nature to survive and flourish.

The efforts to suppress the pandemic have limited our daily activities beyond mere inconvenience. They also made us realize that our lives are supported by a large number of essential personnel, including those who grow and deliver our food.

And the bigger truth that emerged from the pandemic is that human health is interlinked with the health of the planet. When we overstep the boundaries of nature’s tolerance, we open the gates for such unmitigated disasters as zoonotic diseases.

As humanity grows larger and wealthier, so does its demand for land to produce food and accommodate urban development. Almost three quarters of planetary land’s surface has already been transformed from its natural state, and the pace of conversion is accelerating, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the very foundation that supports our existence.

Land provides more than 99.7% of our calories. To feed the global population that is projected to reach ten billion by 2050, an extra 593 million hectares of agricultural land, an area nearly twice the size of India, will be required. If land conversion for agriculture continues at the current rate, only 10 per cent of land will be left in its natural state by 2050.

The good news is that while healthy land is finite in quantity, changes in consumer and corporate behaviors together with more efficient land use planning and management can help us meet the demand for essential goods and services without compromising our stock of productive land resources.

To protect ourselves, we must work together with nature. Land degradation neutrality is an international commitment (SDG Target 15.3) where countries work together to stop, prevent and reverse the loss of productive land. Already, 90 out of the 124 countries committed to achieving this goal have set voluntary national targets which amount to over 400 million hectares of land restoration. Land degradation neutrality is a framework that policymakers can use to address vulnerabilities in the global, regional and national economies exposed by the pandemic to address land degradation, food insecurity, sustainable development well-being and climate targets.

Healthy land is a safety net for everyone, but especially for such vulnerable groups as rural women and youth who rely on land for their livelihood. As we are gearing up for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the UN Food Systems Summit, we have a tremendous opportunity to invest in a healthy and sustainable relationship with nature, to grow, nourish and sustain not just ourselves, but our environment, as the World Food Day 2020 slogan proclaims. It is our new social contract for nature.

At home in Mauritania, we say “If you watch your pot, your food will not burn.” We can no longer accept the reality where over 820 million people are undernourished while one-third of all food produced each year is lost or wasted. Our inefficient consumption and production are a threat to the planet’s health and to our own future. We need to watch our pot, so that no one goes hungry today, with plenty of good food left over for tomorrow.

The brief notes the need for “transition pathways,” and reviews the negotiations to establish and further the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its protocols as the main forum for the international community to conserve biodiversity, use its components sustainable, and share fairly and equitably the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.

The brief notes that the coming decade is of utmost importance for global biodiversity governance, and a failure to adopt and implement a post-2020 global biodiversity framework “may lead to irreversible biodiversity loss in the near future.”

The brief is the second in the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series from the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team, which builds on the message of the landmark 1972 UN report, ‘Only One Earth,’ reminding humanity we have no other home but this planet. The series is being released in the lead-up to the 50th anniversaries of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which will be marked in 2022.

The policy briefs assess the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy, drawing on the environmental negotiation insights of the global ENB team. The briefs aim to guide future efforts to address the causes of climate change, support the sustainable management of natural resources, and foster fair and sustainable economies.

The first brief in the series, titled ‘Stockholm and the Birth of Environmental Diplomacy,’ by Pamela Chasek, considers the lessons held in the 1972 Conference as it launched a new era of global cooperation on environmental issues and paved the way for the concept of sustainable development and the birth of UNEP.

311,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/saicm-explores-costing-tools-for-sound-chemicals-management/,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,SAICM Explores Costing Tools for Sound Chemicals Management,"In a policy brief, the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) shows how governments are using economic tools to balance the benefits of chemicals with their socio-economic, health, and environmental costs.

The brief titled, ‘Role of economic instruments for the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ calls for greater understanding of cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments as potential tools to mobilize resources and help countries achieve sound chemicals and waste management.

Costing instruments can create incentives to not pollute, and create a level playing field for producers.

The authors explain that some external costs arising from the unsound management of chemicals and waste are not accounted for in the price of goods and products. With the global chemicals industry (including pharmaceuticals) worth approximately USD 5.7 trillion and expected to double by 2030, many have called for more action to internalize these costs throughout the chemicals value chain.

Cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments aim to provide signals and incentives to stimulate behavioral change across the value chain. They can bring about benefits including:

internalizing and reflecting the true cost of the production, consumption, and final disposal of goods;

creating an incentive to not pollute or create waste;

providing revenues so countries can, for example: fund national chemical authorities and develop infrastructure for waste collection, sorting, and recycling;

responding to increased consumer demand for sustainability and accountability;

creating a level playing field so producers follow the same rules and standards; and

contributing to national commitments towards the SDGs.

SDG 3 calls for reducing illness and deaths linked to chemical exposure (SDG target 3.9), SDG 12 is ‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,’ and three other Goals (SDGs 6, 14, and 15) address the need to reduce pollution as a key driver of biodiversity loss.

The brief reports that governments are using cost recovery measures and economic instruments to generate additional resources, which on chemicals management include taxes, fees, tradeable permits, and subsidies. On waste, targeted tools include: extended producer responsibility (EPR); deposit refund schemes to discourage improper disposal; and pay-as-you-throw, which supports waste collection activities.

Prerequisites for governments to use cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments, the authors say, may include:

political will and national vision;

ambitious targets;

public-private collaboration;

financial resources, including seed funding to institutionalize a policy framework for chemical safety;

a flexible legal foundation based on sound data and design;

designated institutional body;

third-party verification of products;

revenues from cost recovery fees that go toward ensuring chemicals safety and waste management; and

monitoring framework to track progress.

The Beyond 2020 framework is currently under deliberation, and outcomes are expected at the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in 2021. To secure financing beyond 2020, the brief describes next steps such as to conduct research drawing on lessons from the “biodiversity incentives” of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Bank’s carbon pricing programme. On providing capacity support, the brief suggests collecting best practices at the national level to create a “living document” for inclusion in the SAICM knowledge management platform to guide national action. On developing policy and tracking progress, the brief mentions developing: a global cost internalization programme; relevant indicators for Beyond 2020 to monitor use of mechanisms and instruments; and a common harmonized framework to improve tracking, reporting and assessment of finance flows.

The brief draws from and complements an earlier SAICM document, ‘Review of cost recovery mechanisms and other economic instruments for financing of the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ which was prepared in advance of ICCM4.

312,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/doha-amendment-enters-into-force/,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Doha Amendment to Enter into Force,"The Doha Amendment, which establishes the Kyoto Protocol’s 2013-2020 second commitment period, has received the required number of ratifications to enter into force. Once in force, the emission reduction commitments of participating developed countries and economies in transition (EITs) become legally binding.

The Doha Amendment’s entry into force, a UNFCCC press release notes, is “critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.” Its entry into force also means that “accounting of the Kyoto Protocol’s second phase can go ahead as anticipated and that the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance committee can fully fulfill its legal functions.”

Since our last update in July 2019, 15 countries have ratified the Doha Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 145. The Amendment will formally enter into force within 90 days from 1 October 2020, when the 144th instrument of acceptance was received by the Depositary.

The Amendment’s entry into force is critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.

Angola submitted its instrument of acceptance on 22 September 2020; Bolivia on 17 September 2020; Egypt on 3 February 2020; El Salvador on 18 September 2019; Georgia on 16 June 2020; Ghana on 24 September 2020; Guatemala on 15 October 2019; Jamaica on 1 October 2020; Jordan on 3 January 2020; Nigeria on 2 October 2020; Niue on 10 December 2019; North Macedonia on 18 October 2019; Senegal on 27 May 2020; Sierra Leone on 15 June 2020; and Zambia on 22 August 2019.

The Amendment sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 18% compared to 1990 levels for participating countries. This, according to the UNFCCC, “represents an increase from an average reduction of 5% compared to 1990 levels” during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period from 2008-2012.

“The Doha Amendment’s entry into force is a strong signal of a unified, multilateral commitment to address climate change,” said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. She noted that it represents political commitment to pre-2020 action, which, she said, is necessary to build trust ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.

The entry into force of the Doha Amendment occurs at a time when global emissions are likely to result in an increase of global average temperatures of 3°C above preindustrial levels, the UNFCCC warns. Therefore, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries are expected to submit in 2020 remain critical for reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep global warming “well below” 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.

The report shares highlights and trends based on data from 14 major sustainability standards for bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and forestry products.

‘The State of Sustainable Markets 2020: Statistics and Emerging Trends,’ provides data on area, production volume, and producers for 14 standard-setting organizations focused on the eight commodities and forestry. The report finds that the certified farmland of most of the eight crops is expanding: between 2014 and 2018, the certified area of all agricultural commodities covered in the report grew by 52%. Cotton has the largest certified area: 18.2% of land cultivated for cotton globally is now certified. Cocoa, oil palm, and coffee represent the crops with the next largest areas of certified land. Commodities with the smallest certified area are soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and bananas. Buyers of most of the eight crops are also making progress in establishing and disclosing sustainable sourcing commitments.

Organic represents the biggest sustainability standard for both area and product variety. In 2018, 1.5% of agricultural land worldwide was classified as organic. In forestry, two standards dominate. The forest area certified by Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) continues to exceed the forest area certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC): 7.7% of forest area is PEFC-certified, compared with 4.9% of global forest area certified under FSC.

The report highlights the role of consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainably grown products in driving the rising popularity of certified products like bananas, cocoa, and soybeans. At the same time, ITC’s Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton cautions against depending “on consumer sentiment alone” to drive sustainability and certification. Coke-Hamilton recommends engaging with multinational buyers and policymakers to see how they can scale the uptake of sustainability standards across additional goods and countries. Additional driving forces behind growth in sustainability include implementation of risk management strategies by private companies that source commodities from developing countries, and regulatory frameworks that establish commodity sourcing conditions in both producing and consuming countries.

On COVID-19, the authors note that the pandemic has increased stress on exporters of the products analyzed in the report. Within this context, the report emphasizes that voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use more environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices while also improving their competitiveness and differentiating their product offerings.

ITC launched this fifth global report at the ITC Good Trade Summit, which took place virtually from 7-8 October on the theme, ‘Emerging Stronger from the COVID-19 Crisis.’ ITC produced the report in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), with financial support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.

314,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/invisible-and-uncounted-sex-workers-in-india/,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Invisible and Uncounted: Sex Workers in India,"By a member of the National Network of Sex Workers

The National Network of Sex Workers (NNSW) is a collective led by sex workers in India to protect and promote the rights of those in the profession at the local, national, and international levels. Along with giving a voice to the issues of sex workers at all relevant forums, they also work to address myths, misconceptions, stigma, discrimination that marginalize sex workers and creates conditions for violence against them.

Although sex work is not a crime in India, many sex workers face threats because of associated activities that are criminalized under law, such as running or managing a brothel and soliciting in public spaces. Additionally, stigma makes sex workers vulnerable to violence and discrimination.

One sex worker in India explains, “there is no room for respect or acceptance towards our profession as sex workers. When I approach schools with sufficient income and all the required documents, my 5-year-old child still is denied admission. Although there is no legal requirement to provide the father’s name or documents, one school used it as an excuse to deny my child’s right to education. And when a pregnant sex worker needs to have her delivery, the hospital gives her the lowest priority, even in an emergency.”

Members of the sex worker community also face new vulnerabilities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and alienation from the government’s responses. To protect the rights of those in stigmatized professions, we need data and evidence. Community members are in the best position to reach out to each other and create a record of our experiences and development status.

Becoming a Field Investigator

In 2019, the Wada Na Todo Abhiyan (WNTA) campaign, which promotes government accountability to end poverty and social exclusion, invited the NNSW to participate in the 100 Hotspots Study on socially excluded and vulnerable communities as seen through the SDGs. Seizing the opportunity to track development issues in our community, we gathered community data for 100 households between Maharashtra and Telangana states. It was an important exercise for the network to engage with other campaigns and also build data on the sex worker community.

WNTA trained me on research methodology and collecting data. Initially, it was very challenging, as members of the community hesitated to participate, in order to keep their identities confidential. Being a sex worker myself, I was able to convince them by explaining that this research will be useful for strengthening the rights of sex workers. It would have been very difficult for a non-community member to engage sex workers to obtain the right information.

Findings from Sex-Worker-Led Households

I surveyed 50 households from my community. I learned several lessons:

Less than 35% of the people living in sex workers’ households reported having a birth certificate; lack of identity documents limits their access to basic services like scholarships, housing, public distribution system, and other government benefits. Health care is important for sex workers given the nature of our profession. However, those I interviewed had to spend their own money to access health care services from private providers because of discrimination by state providers.

The level of education among community members is just 43%. Sex workers aspire to better education and employment opportunities for our children, but discrimination and stigma deter our children from schooling, and especially through local government schools. In some places, sex workers collectives and organizations have set up hostels and schools to ensure our children can access basic education.

Most sex workers’ households lack economic and social security because they are unable to own land or homes. The majority of those I interviewed live in single rooms, with no separate kitchen and community bathrooms. Approximately 50% of the land owned by sex workers’ households is in a women’s name, but this number is unsatisfactory considering that the majority of women in the community are the sole income-earners in their families.

The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown have made us more vulnerable. The national government recognized the vulnerability of some sections of the population, such as migrant laborers, unorganized laborers, and women, sex workers remain uncounted, invisible, and stigmatised. Government relief packages do not provide anything for us.

Many of our community members find it difficult to meet day-to-day needs, given that we cannot entertain clients, and our access to state services is negligible. The health care system is totally focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have had more difficulties than usual in accessing regular health care services.

Despite the high prevalence of violence perpetrated by police officers and other state authorities, reporting on these incidents is negligible. This reflects the lack of implementation of the Constitutional rights or legislation, as well as the continued stranglehold of social exclusion and hierarchies.

Documenting Those Left Behind

The community research process introduced me to the SDGs and their focus on vulnerable communities under the “leave no one behind” principle.

Sex workers face the threats of police brutality, violence from clients, and ostracization from community and even their families. The larger society too has a negative and biased opinion of sex workers, which furthers the hardships, violence and challenges in accessing services or justice.

To protect the rights of those in stigmatized professions, we need data and evidence to articulate our status. Such data and information can only be gathered through members of the community, because none other than us know the kind of challenges we face.

This report is one of the first ones where we engaged with larger civil society networks and also built up basic documentation of our context. This work enables us to raise our concerns with the state and have a voice in global and international forums.

CMU says its “Voluntary University Review” is the first in the world, adding that it “sends a strong signal that universities are a critical partner” in achieving the SDGs.

To conduct the review, the university pulled together a team including students, professors and staff who reviewed published information about Carnegie Mellon’s activities, writes Inside Higher Ed. The review included 17 Zoom meetings, each organized around one of the SDGs. Initial findings will be supplemented by additional information provided by CMU community members over the 2020/2021 academic year.

The intention is for CMU’s Voluntary University Review to be “a framework for us to track what we are doing across the 17 Global Goals and where we might find opportunities to do more. We also hope that by issuing this VUR, we will spark action at other institutions of higher education to do the same.”

Carnegie Mellon calls the review a stepping stone. With the initial review complete, the university plans to work on enhancing its progress toward the SDGs by working within the CMU community as well as within the higher education community at large.

In September, 2019, CMU launched its Sustainability Initiative, which it says builds on its committed to enhancing its sustainability practices within the framework of theSDGs.

The paper titled, ‘Advancing Digital Trade in Asia,’ considers how officials across Asia have responded to the explosive growth of digital trade in the region. Noting that digital trade is not new – the World Trade Organization (WTO) created a work programme on the matter in 1998 – the paper emphasizes the importance of the digital economy, which has been reinforced by COVID-19 and associated lockdowns.

However, the authors emphasize that multiple and changing definitions of ‘digital trade’ do not always align with existing trade agreements, which can fail to capture four key dimensions of the term: 1) digital goods and services (e.g. software); 2) tangible goods and services delivered digitally (e.g. apparel); 3) digital enablers of trade in tangible goods (e.g. logistics tracking); and 4) emerging transformative digital technologies (e.g. blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI)). Accordingly, the paper examines new trends, and considers how digital trade deals and other regulatory responses, like the application of digital taxation policies, may affect the growth of digital trade in Asia.

The paper identifies seven overarching trends in digital trade:

the rise of digital ecosystems and increasing connectivity in the region; linkages by regional platforms, or “unicorns” that may be less familiar outside the region; Asian firms’ leading position in providing digital/physical interfaces, powered by 5G; the increasing role of Asia as a hub for cloud services, including data collection and analytics; consumers’ increasing preference for subscription services, including livestreaming; growing numbers of applications that solve digital financial services and payments gaps; and the growing potential for misuse or harm that could flow from digitally connected devices and users.

Noting that these trends are often picked up by or accounted for in trade agreements – including the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), and the Digital Economy Agreement (DEA) – the paper flags that agreements from the region have been at the forefront of rule making on digital trade issues. These agreements generally aim to reduce trade barriers to the digital economy, the paper summarizes, and build compatible standards to facilitate interoperability and cross-border consumer trust. The paper compares the DEA, DEPA, and CPTPP across 23 digital trade provisions, highlighting whether the provisions are identical across the agreements, whether a provision in one agreement is more or less comprehensive than the others, and if a similar provision is lacking in the agreement.

The report identifies five challenge areas for digital trade policies that have emerged as key points for debate, where governments are struggling to reach consensus despite having made progress via the above agreements. Challenges remain on data transfer mechanisms, consumer protection, digital trade facilitation, emerging technologies, and digital taxation policies.

The WEF’s Global Future Council on International Trade and Investment is a multi-stakeholder and interdisciplinary knowledge network dedicated to promoting innovative thinking to shape a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future.

In that mega event, more than 500 students from over 40 schools across the globe participated in numerous competitions. The chief guest of that event was SN Sahu, an ardent follower of Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda. The guests of honour were Venugopal Dharmarajan, Rabbi Ezekiel Issac Maleker, Ahlcon Group of Schools director Dr Ashok Kumar Pandey, principals of both the Ahlcon schools – Sanjay Yadav and Dr Deepak Bisht– and the principals of the participating schools.

Even when the world had not completely gone online for the education purposes, Ahlcon International had set a precedent by organising SDG-Fest online in 2018. Since then, it has been the tradition of this school to celebrate this festival on every anniversary of the Global Goals. Through the SDG-Fest 2020, a roadmap for the SDG crusadors, was brought to the forefront, awareness was spread through carefully chiseled activities and communities were involved in all the competitions. Students from pre-primary to Class 12 submitted online entries for myriad activities based on the SDGs. They raised the bar with thought-provoking presentations all aligned to promote the Global Goals.

The SDG Mega Marathon event was the most unique feature of the festival in which 152 participants from across the world participated under the umbrella of the SDGs.

DPS, Gurugram, conducts webinar on parenting skills

Delhi Public School, Sector 45, Gurugram organised the Wellness Webinar Series 9.0 ‘Let’s Talk – Parenting’ to discuss effective parenting skills which help us as a society to nurture strong, responsible and happy children. The discussion was moderated by school director-principal Aditi Misra. The eminent panelists comprised psychologist and relationship therapist Vichitra Dargan Anand, counsellor Sonia Pillai as well as author and educator Rohit Kumar. The panel also included DPS Gurugram vice principal Santvna Thadani; dean, student welfare, Sapna Dhawan, and parents’ body representatives Sachin Chugh and Nipun Marya. The webinar was attended by 6,485 people and garnered 1,400 views on Facebook.

Aditi Misra initiated the discussion by greeting all the panelists and asking them to share one parenting lesson which they learnt from their parents and imparted to their children and another lesson which they didn’t carry forward. The discussions brought forth important lessons in parenting, like giving respect to all, involving children in important family decisions, perseverance, generosity and active listening skills etc,

While discussing the different styles of parenting, Anand said that it is her firm belief that building a child is like building a skyscraper with a strong foundation. Marya observed that parents should not compare their children with others as each child is unique. Pillai said parents must build a circle of trust with their children. The speakers emphasised various techniques of positive parenting in today’s time. Kumar said parents should be good role models for children. Chugh felt that as parents one must never forget to hug and cuddle one’s children. A very effective positive discipline tool that was explained by Kumar was – ‘no correction without connection’.

Thadani advised parents to be good listeners and love their children and Dhawan stressed on the importance of inculcating strong values. The discussion was concluded by a rapid-fire round wherein the panelists answered questions posed by the moderator. Misra thanked the panelists for sharing their insights.","Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar, celebrated the SDG-Fest 2020 on a virtual platform to mark the fifth anniversary of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with unprecedented fervour and zeal.

PEOPLE use wide a range of goods for their livelihood, comfort and amenities. The use or consumption pattern of goods varies because of changes in the way of life, predominantly contributed by economic development, technological diversity and population growth. The goods that people use for sustenance are discarded as they reach the end of their use. Waste management comes at play in protect the environment to manage the discarded goods.

The goods that people use can be divided into two principal categories: solid and liquid. Different streams of wastes originate from these two categories. Streams of wastes like perishable household wastes, construction and demolition wastes, electronic and electrical wastes, rubber, metal, glass, plastic, hazardous medical wastes, etc originate from the solid waste category. Industrial effluent, grey water, black water, paints, chemicals, etc fall in the category of liquid waste. Wastes in each of these categories and streams have the potential to damage every fabric of the environment. To prevent any harmful effects, each waste stream is handled in different ways.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are an urgent call for action by all countries, developed and developing, in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The common purpose and objective of both waste management and Agenda 2030 are to protect the environment for human benefits. The goals that the Agenda 2030 adopted for a sustainable development involve a range of functions and activities. Those functions and activities are also found in waste management. The 3R — reduce, reuse and recycle — approach in waste management is recognised globally. It encompasses a series of activities with contribution to the environment and society. For example, reuse activities create jobs, save energy, cut disposal costs, reduce the use of virgin raw materials, reduce CO2 emission, extend life of landfill and reduce pressure on land.

Waste management value addition

Goal 1 has the target to ‘end poverty in all its form everywhere’ through the development of social protection systems with targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. Waste management prevents the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbon, CO2, etc which improves environmental degradation narrowing down the risk of human vulnerability to natural disaster. Waste management also prevents the pollution of water, another area of human vulnerability.

Goal 2 eyes ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Food security is a global concern against the backdrop of the population growth and shrinking agricultural land which include cropland, forest, mangrove forest, river, lake, tea estate and salt span etc. Countries are losing agricultural land every year because of population settlement, infrastructure development, industrialisation, etc.

Food loss and waste annually contribute to 3.3 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. If a fourth of the food loss or wastes across the globe could be avoided, it could feed 750 million people. Food loss and waste affect the food supply chain, lowering income for food producers and wholesalers, increase consumer cost for food and constrain the access of low income groups to food. Minimising food loss, which waste management compliments, can improve food security and environmental gains.

Goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all in all stages. In Bangladesh, there is a large informal recycling sector in different streams of wastes. The glass recycling sector recycles about 180,000 tonnes of discarded container glasses every year. According to industry sources, the economic value of this quantity of discarded glasses at waste pickers’ level is estimated at Tk 180 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 1 a kilogram. The value of glass recyclables at the wholesaler level is estimated at Tk 450 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 2.50 a kilogram. It is estimated that annually about 96,000 tonnes of plastic waste is recycled across the country. This plastic waste has Tk 288 million in economic value at the waste picker level. Recycling has created employment for thousands of people which gives them an earning.

Goal 6 ensures an available and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Leachate percolating from decomposing waste goes into surface and ground water systems, if not protected. Given the composition and character, municipal solid waste can contain 20–50 per cent of water which it releases as it decomposes. Leachates, if not treated, contaminate ground and surface water. Besides leachate, millions of litres of black water and industry effluents from households and factories are also released into the environment. These are elements of a potential contamination of surface and ground water and it happens quietly. For example, one gallon of paint can contaminate 10 million gallons of drinking water. Waste management requires the treatment of all liquid wastes before being discharged into the environment. This requirement has a direct contribution to ‘sustainable management of water and sanitation’. There are instances that large water body such as rivers, lakes, etc get ruined when ‘waste management’ does not work.

Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Waste treatment technology producing biogas and power from waste provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces waste volume, mitigating pressure on land for waste disposal which can contribute to food security. Second, the residual of biogas can be converted into compost to use as soil stabiliser. Biogas from organic wastes or furnace oil from tyre recycling can be used as additional fuel in waste-to-energy plant where waste has low calorific value. Residuals in waste-to-energy plant, ie bottom ash, can be converted into slag and slag can be used in cement industry to produce bricks, slabs, etc, which can be used in construction works such as the preparation of road base, footpath, etc. The reuse of glass items from cullet consumes 40 per cent less energy than making new glasses from virgin raw materials on the grounds because cullet dissolves at a much lower temperature. Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 per cent. Around 900 litres of oil, a person’s two months’ water use and two people’s energy consumption for a year, can be saved by recycling just one tonne of plastic wastes.

Goal 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation. Waste management through the promotion of the reduction approach encourages industries to produce less waste in the production process where innovation is the key. Industry to sustain in the long term needs to have in-house waste management like effluent treatment plants to treat liquid wastes. Through the reuse approach, waste management promotes an extended use of product and also alternative use through recycling.

Goal 11 makes cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Human settlements in cities and towns cannot be safe with heaps of garbage on their front yard or backyard. Waste management through community activities can involve people to do their part of waste management for a safer living environment.

As countries develop, more urbanisation takes place and construction and demolition waste, a harmful component of waste stream, is on the rise. Generally, the largest part of construction and demolition material is concrete, which encompasses around 70 per cent of waste generated before recycling. There is a range of environmental and economic benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it in a landfill.

The benefits include cheaper source of aggregate, reduction in landfill space required for concrete debris, using recycled material as gravel that reduces the need for gravel mining and, increasingly, high-grade aggregate for road construction is available only at greater distances, increasing the associated economic and environmental cost impacts associated with the longer haulage distances versus using recycled aggregate.

Goal 12 targets a sustainable consumption and production pattern. Sustainable consumption and production is about the use of products and manufacturing process of products that will produce minimal waste, which invokes the 3R approach of waste management. The 3R approach minimises resource consumption in the level sufficient for basic need, which is the reduce component, use goods and materials until they can be repaired or fixed to perform its function recurrently, which is the reuse component, and reprocess the materials being discarded into new products, which is the recycle component. This approach increases resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable consumption and production. For example, it takes 1.5 tonnes of water, 22 kilograms of chemicals and 243 litres of fossil fuel to produce one computer. An extended use of a product can reduce the consumption of water, chemical and fossil fuel and also reduce waste generation. Its overall impact comes on environmental improvement.

Goal 13 encourages urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. As decay starts, waste emits methane, a greenhouse gas, impacting climate change. The emission of methane is visible in landfill during the dry season. Methane is also a cause of fire in the landfill. As waste burns, CO2 is generated. CO2 is another greenhouse gas. The contribution of the 3R approach to mitigating climate change is found in waste, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land use change and forestry sectors. In the waste sector, methane emission is reduced by gas recovery in the landfill. Energy recovered from waste reduces emissions from fossil fuel. Reduction in food loss and waste is an action in the agricultural sector to combat climate change. Food loss and waste represent the wastage of resources, including the land, water, labour, and energy resource used to produce food. It strongly contributes to climate change because greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution activities, and methane is released during the decay of food waste.

Goal 14 conserves and sustainably uses the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 6, 12 and 14 are interlinked. An uneconomical consumption of materials in production and irresponsible discharge of waste combined with absence of waste management has not ensured the availability and sustainable management of water bodies like the River Buriganga, the River Turag and the River Balu. An irresponsible discharge of plastics in the world oceans threaten marine lives.

Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manages forests, combats desertification and halts and reverses land degradation and halts biodiversity loss. Activities embedded and innovations in the 3R approach have all potentials to address the issues stated in Goal 15 on Agenda 2030.

The SDGs are for public good to improve different facets of environmental sustainability. Goals are attached to human well-being and environmental improvement through a series of activities. A wide range of activities in waste management are naturally aligned with the SDGs. An improved waste management directly complements the achievement of the SDG. While 11 of the 17 goals get direct contribution, 6 receives indirect support from waste management.

Columnist: Stephen Haizel

Ghana like many developing countries faces a lot of challenges for which citizens expect the government to fix. With resources limited, it comes down to the government’s priority in determining which challenge deserves to be addressed at any particular time.



One can safely say however that, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to which Ghana is a signatory reflects the aspirations of Ghanaians. These goals include elimination of poverty, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth amongst others. The SDGs are 17 in all.



Ghana has co-chaired the Sustainable Development Goals Advocates for a while now.



SDG 6 relates to clean water and sanitation, which is an area Ghana has not really performed well. Nevertheless, SDG 6 is central to the attainment of the goals relating to agriculture, health, inclusive and equitable education and to some extent poverty eradication.



Furthermore, access to water and sanitation services gives meaning to the right to life and dignity which are inviolable.



Clean water and sanitation are so basic that authorities have to do everything within their power to achieve universal access at all cost. This will require a clear strategy and policy direction from government. The ad hoc provision of water and sanitation facilities is not the solution.



Data on water and sanitation are hard to come by. However, per the Voluntary National Review (VNR) report submitted to the UN by the government of Ghana in 2019 and the Joint Monitoring Programme Report (2017), seventy-nine percent (79%) of the population have access to basic drinking water whereas only twenty-one percent (21%) have access to basic sanitation.



Ghana being a democratic country has changed governments frequently at least 5 times in the last 28 years. A new government may not necessarily continue the plans and strategies of the previous one. That is where the problem lies.



Having good regulatory governance for the water and sanitation sector, a clear financing plan and an innovative implementation strategy is key to achieving SDG 6.



A look at the manifestos of the two largest political parties in Ghana, specifically the aspects relating to water and sanitation gives a clue to the level of seriousness these parties attach to this all important sector.



The largest opposition party has promised a number of things, which include:



Develop Ghana’s water & sanitation sector to improve all citizens’ health,



Optimise agricultural and industrial production to create employment, and build national climate change resilience



Build the capacity of Assemblies to manage water provision and sanitation services with technical support from the Ministry of Water Works and Housing and our Technical Universities



Develop technical and managerial training programmes for Assembly Sanitation Officers to properly manage and supervise the operation of all water resource infrastructure



Ensure the sustainability of water sources by halting reckless projects like the proposed mining of the Atiwa forest that is rapidly depleting our natural water reservoirs through evapotranspiration



Enforce the Water Buffer Policy to reduce the pollution of our water bodies.



Specifically on rural water, the NDC has promised to:



Achieve one hundred per cent (100 %) rural water coverage by 2025 diversify scientifically using available data to construct groundwater, small dams, rainwater harvesting, and floodwater harvesting systems as appropriate in different areas based on the specific resources and needs.



With regards to Sanitation, the NDC promised to:



Establish the Plastic Waste Recycling Fund provided for under the Customs and Excise (Duties and other Taxes) (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Act 863)



Formulate a National Sanitation Policy and strengthen the role of MMDAs in sanitation as enshrined in the Local Governance Act, 2016 (Act 936)



Re-introduce the National Sanitation Day



Launch an aggressive public education programme on water conservation improve liquid waste management working with indigenous businesses to build wastewater treatment and recycling plants first for public institutions that have common sewer systems and then for major industrial establishments, estates, and settlement areas



Empower the Sanitation Courts and enforce sanitation laws.



The NDC manifesto seems to address the regulatory governance challenge relating to the provision of water and sanitation. With a clear source of funding, this proposal looks very achievable.



The NPP on the other hand, indicates in their manifesto that, the government has been building water and sanitation systems, schools and healthcare facilities, small earth dams and dugouts, markets and security infrastructure through flagship initiatives such as IPEP and Zongo Development Fund.



Furthermore, the NPP states that, they have constructed the largest number of places of convenience than any government in the 4th Republic. They assert that, under the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area Water and Sanitation Project, 27,242 household and 238 institutional toilets have been constructed.



They further state that under the Sustainable and Rural Water and Sanitation project, 12,972 household toilets have been constructed and 351 communities have attained Open Defecation-Free (ODF) status.



This manifesto does not give a strategic plan neither does it focus on regulatory governance. What it does is to state the source of funding for such projects and what government has done.



It must be noted that there are institutions and agencies charged with the responsibility of providing water and sanitation such as the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) and MMDAs.



The governance structure of water and sanitation services in Ghana looks formidable on paper. Empowering the various institutions and ensuring there is much collaboration and also injecting the much needed capital can work the trick in ensuring SDG 6 is achieved by 2030. The CWSA for instance must be more decentralised by having agents at all MMDAs to provide technical support to these MMDAs.



Achieving universal access to water seems very possible, however, a comprehensive strategy will have to be adopted to deal with sanitation in order to achieve the target by 2030.



Whatever the promises of the two leading parties are, it will not be far-fetched to state that what Ghanaian expect from whichever party wins is for all people to have access to at least basic water and sanitation.



","One can safely say however that, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to which Ghana is a signatory reflects the aspirations of Ghanaians.

Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

Philippine Science Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña, in a news release, said he is “very happy about the announcement” of the appointment of Montoya to be among the authors of GSDR.

“The whole DOST family is very proud of this recognition given to Dr. Montoya,” de la Peña said in the news release posted on DOST’s Facebook account.

Produced once every four years, the SDG report aims to employ the scientific perspective in guiding policy-makers on the state of global sustainable development, and serve as a “strong evidence-based instrument” in eradicating poverty.

The report will also feed the “high-level global review” of the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations in September 2030.

The designation of the independent group followed an extensive consultation process that involved nominations from UN member states which concluded in December 2019.

The 15 scientists were selected by Guterres to author the GSDR and conduct a follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for SDGs.

The “diverse group,” according to the UN, represents a wide range of disciplines and are composed of the following scientists: John Agard (Trinidad and Tobago), Kaltham Ali Al-Ghanim (Qatar), Sergey N. Bobylev (Russian Federation), Opha Pauline Dube, (Botswana), Ibrahima Hathie (Senegal), Norichika Kanie (Japan), Nyovani Janet Madise (Malawi), Shirin Malekpour (Australia), J. Jaime Miranda (Peru), Jaime C Montoya (Philippines), Jiahua Pan (China), Åsa Persson (Sweden), Ambuj D Sagar (India), Imme Scholz (Germany), Nancy Shackell (Canada).

Led by Agard and Scholz, the independent group will author the second report of its kind. The first GSDR has been released in September of 2019 titled, “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development.”

PCHRD is at the forefront of the country’s fight against the current Covid-19 pandemic.

As the country’s lead coordinator for health research and development initiatives, PCHRD supports Filipino researchers in health research innovation, policy recommendations, and technology commercialization.

It provides scholarships to Filipino students in the field of health and medicine, and establishes information and communication systems to disseminate health research information both for local and international stakeholders.","“We are honored to be selected as part of the distinguished experts to author a very significant report on the global SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],” Montoya said in a DOST-PCHRD news release.

Article content The fact Cornwall, SDG, and Akwesasne have had fewer COVID-19 numbers than neighbouring Prescott-Russell is due in part to luck, but also to hard work and diligence from local residents, said Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement. “A lot of people have said, in Cornwall particularly, that we have been lucky with our number of cases, but I always respond to that by saying that I don’t know if it’s luck,” she said. “I think that people here have worked hard too, to follow the rules and to adapt. We’ve made some sacrifices too. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Cornwall-SDG's COVID-19 numbers: hard-work, dedication and luck, says mayor Back to video “That’s not to say that we’re better than anyone else — that’s not at all what I mean to say. I just want to make sure that people know that it’s not just luck. That we’re fortunate that those numbers are low, but we work hard to keep them low.” As of Tuesday, the Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) recorded a total of 35 cases of COVID in Cornwall — seven of them active. The SDG townships on the other hand, had recorded a total of about 67, 18 of them being active.

Article content The number is in stark contract to municipalities north of SDG that lie within the Eastern Ontario Health Unit’s jurisdiction. Russell alone has recorded a total of 47, with 19 of them active. Clarence-Rockland on the other hand, has had 61 cases and currently is home to 18 active cases. Alfred-Plantagenet, which boasts a significantly smaller number of residents as opposed to Cornwall, has had 51 cases. For of them are active. So what has led the Prescott-Russell region to have far more positive cases than SDG and Cornwall? Well for one, the county itself shares more borders the Ottawa area, which has itself seen a giant leap in cases. According to the EOHU, many residents of the Clarence-Rockland and Russell area work in Ottawa. “This is why I think we have more cases in the western part of Prescott-Russell as compared to SDG and Cornwall,” Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health for the EOHU, told the Standard-Freeholder. “However, we are seeing case numbers in SDG/Cornwall increase as well, so our recent case count surges are not exclusive to Prescott-Russell.” Roumeliotis has always been cautious with discussing caseloads in different areas of the EOHU region, stressing the virus can travel anywhere and that continued practise of public-health measures and vigilance remain important. All three of the regions under the EOHU’s umbrella, declared a state of emergency at the same time earlier this year.

Article content “I declared that alongside my colleagues, Pierre Leroux (Prescott-Russell warden) and Frank Prevost (SDG warden),” said Clement. “We all worked with Dr. Paul (Roumeliotis) closely.” The rising number of cases in both Ottawa and Prescott-Russell has and continues to be a worry, according to Clement, who spoke of the challenge the pandemic has created for municipalities and elected officials. “When you run for office, whether for city council or any office really, you run because you want to move things forward,” she said. “You want to make sure that there’s growth and that the potential of your community is fulfilled. That’s why I ran. You never run thinking that you’re going to have to manage a crisis. That’s never in your mind.” Being mayor as well as executive director of the SDG legal aid clinic, Clement said she has witnessed the many emotions currently running high in the community during the pandemic — sadness, anger and frustration. “I know very well that the more vulnerable individuals in our community are even more vulnerable due to this pandemic,” she said. “The disparity between people who have little and people who have more is I think accentuated by the pandemic, and I feel that.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

The expected fall “second wave” has been occurring, and hospitals in Cornwall, Alexandria and Winchester all have the same capacity as in the spring – or greater.

Cornwall/SDG hospitals say they remain prepared for COVID-19 cases Back to video “We’ve taken a multi-layered approach to ensure our hospital can provide exceptional care for local patients – no matter the circumstance,” said Jeanette Despatie, CEO and president of Cornwall Community Hospital. Despatie referenced the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its passengers quarantined at Nav Centre last February, in noting CCH has been well-prepared for potential COVID-19 patients for many months, and that the hospital’s approach has always “been robust, and continues to evolve to meet the needs of patients during this challenging time.”

Article content Unlike in the early spring, area hospitals – and all of the facilities across Ontario – are dealing with COVID-19 while offering a lot of the regular services that had been suspended during the first wave. But the months of experience and opportunity to work at establishing safe processes for maintaining services – including diagnostic tests/procedures or outpatient surgical clinics – has been invaluable. Over the months since the pandemic began, Despatie said, CCH has provided staff and physicians with additional education and simulation training, as well as training in infection prevention and control measures. She said that, over the longer time period, the hospital has had the opportunity to purchase additional equipment required to expand patient capacity, should the situation worsen. “We’ve reconfigured our flexible spaces to identify up to a 30 per cent increase in bed capacity, should we need it,” Despatie said. “Fortunately, we’ve also been able to expand our supply of (PPE).” More On This Topic Cornwall, SDG hospitals to receive money for infrastructure upgrades Cornwall and area hospitals preparing to slowly resume regular service Plenty of COVID-19 capacity within SDG hospitals, for now At Winchester District Memorial Hospital, capacity hasn’t changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 late in the winter, and precautions and restrictions remain in place. Cholly Boland, the hospital CEO, said that, like all hospitals in the province, WDMH eventually restored outpatient and non-urgent surgical services, but that it did not alter the facility’s inpatient capacity.

Article content “Most of our surgical patients are admitted and discharged on the same day, and do not occupy an inpatient bed,” Boland said. Boland added the hospital has more people coming to its emergency department than was the case in the spring, and that “we’ve configured our waiting room and screening process to accommodate that increase.” And while Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria also is well-prepared and capable of treating patients with the COVID-19 virus, CEO and president Michael Cohen said there’s a very big difference between the spring and now for many hospitals in the region, in that the demand for inpatient beds “has never been greater. . . in the spring, the hospital system suspended elective activity in order to free up capacity and staff to respond to the pandemic. Provincially, elective activity resumed, and, at the same time, the wait for long-term care has never been higher. “I’ve been in the business for over 25 years, and I’ve never seen (Alternate Level of Care) numbers so high.” Cohen said that, regionally, over 700 patients are waiting for placement in hospitals. “Unfortunately, the (LTC) sector is suffering from outbreaks, staffing shortages and isolation requirements that limit and impede the flow of patients from hospitals,” Cohen said. “We’re just not able to access these beds as quickly as we once did. “Collectively we’re working with the province to develop temporary alternatives to get readily available beds into the system soon, which should bring welcome relief.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

“We don’t want spraying at the guardrails, it’s our right to not have leakage,” Faubert said during the presentation. “Obviously this will happen again if you spray (the guardrail area). . . you have a bylaw giving us a right to put up (the signs). We need to know the no spray bylaw is abided by.”

Diane Faubert at the virtual meeting detailed a “significant incident” back in mid-July when a stretch of pesticide spraying over two metres wide was done along County Road 43 guardrails, located between organic farms in the Alexandria area and where “no spray” signs are posted. She said the guardrails are above a steep embankment, and that the chemicals leaked onto the farmland below.

Faubert says she’s all in favour of roadside mowing, but why is the “excellent solution” of whipper snipping at the guard rails being abandoned in favour of pesticides?

Faubert said the signs have been going up for 11 years, and she thanked SDG for never spraying in that area, until 2020. She said her farms include conservation wetlands, organic fields and swamps, and beehives and honey bees, insects that are at-risk if there’s spraying.

Faubert spoke about 270 acres of organic land, all managed without spraying any “dangerous chemicals.” She said 8,000 trees were planted last year on her land, that lawnmowers are “used around every single tree” and that there’s “not one iota” of herbicide used, yet those trees are doing very well.

When councillors commented on Faubert’s presentation, Coun. Carma Williams struck a conciliatory tone, saying “I happen to be sensitive to the contents of your delegation today. . . we have to modernize our thinking, how we deal with (signs).

“In the future we have to be more respectful with regards to spraying.”

Coun. Steven Byvelds said as an agriculturalist, he found Faubert’s “blanket statement” that all spraying is bad to be an overstatement, and the science on the issue has to be followed.

“There’s a balance (to strike), but we can certainly work together on making that balance happen,” he said. “I look forward to (the debate at county council).”

Faubert said she agreed with the spirit of compromising, but “we also have no spray signs – those have to be respected. . . it’s not easy to put up those signs, it’s a lot of work. I’d appreciate them being respected.”

Byvelds in a follow-up comment said SDG crews did make “an error by spraying in your area.”

328,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/5-ways-businesses-can-rebuildbetter/,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: 5 Ways Businesses Can #RebuildBetter,"By Zahid Torres-Rahman

We are a decade away from the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, yet when they were set in 2015, very few people would have anticipated a global pandemic affecting almost every country and territory across the world in 2020. The predictions are dire, from the projected number of people who will die from the virus, to the impact on food security, livelihoods and markets, to the effect on the social fabric of many communities.

However, among the crisis and chaos, there is also a real opportunity to rebuild better following the pandemic, in a way that leaves vulnerable people and communities significantly better off than they were before.

Decent jobs must be top priority as “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic.

Business Fights Poverty has conducted extensive collaboration with businesses, organizations and individuals, and held online events in July and during the UN’s high-level week in September. Through these discussions we have identified five primary ways that businesses can help with the global effort to rebuild better.

1. Demonstrate a purpose beyond profit

There will be increasing demand from employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders for companies to more actively articulate and demonstrate their wider societal purpose beyond profits (recognizing that firms with purpose also do better financially). Such purpose should include tackling inequality, protecting human rights, supporting climate action and acknowledging their carbon footprint, and being better at, and more transparent about, measuring impact. Practical measures could include a company’s board of directors issuing a “Statement of Purpose” committing to bringing a positive return for their communities and stakeholders, not just shareholders.

2. Support the most vulnerable people and communities within value chains

The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing fragilities in global value chains. Such fragilities include micro, small, and medium enterprises without the cash reserves to endure the economic impact of lockdowns, and hourly workers without access to sick pay or social protection. We have produced an action toolkit, which is free to download from our website, looking at vulnerable workers whose health is at risk due to exposure to the virus, and those whose livelihoods are at risk because they depend on export sectors that have ground to a halt. Articles on tackling hidden labor and a video on enhancing social justice in global supply chains offer additional insight.

3. Invest in building new skills and personal resilience

COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive to the world of work and learning, accelerating trends towards automation and new technology. There is an urgent need for upskilling and reskilling workers – not only with technical skills, but also with the soft skills that are increasingly demanded by employers.

As “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic, decent jobs must be top priority. With support from The Lab at the International Labour Organization (ILO), Business Fights Poverty has created the Better Jobs Action Toolkit to provide guidance to businesses and organizations on ensuring that recovery efforts prioritize decent work.

We have also launched an innovative partnership with life sciences company Bayer, to explore how a wider uptake of “self-care” approaches can reduce pressure on health services, improve health incomes, and empower individuals and communities. Learn more through this online discussion.

4. Prioritize action on equity

The pandemic has affected people differently, based on their gender, race and income level. Women have been more exposed to infection as they make up the majority of front-line health workers. Women also are often in the most vulnerable positions in workforces and value chains, they have faced a surge in domestic violence, and they taken on the burden of unpaid care. At the same time, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery in the U.S. and the resulting protests have exposed deep-rooted, systemic racism and an urgent need for action.

Natalie Deacon of Avon writes that flexible, digital earning opportunities can support women’s well-being and avoid the rolling back of gender gains. On 3 December 2020, Business Fights Poverty will host a one-day online learning and collaborative event on gender equity in pandemic responses. Uwe Gneiting from Oxfam America also shares thoughts on how businesses can tackle inequalities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

5. Build system-level partnerships

COVID-19 has highlighted how truly interconnected we all are as well as the large-scale challenges we face, such as inequity and climate change. So, we need to rethink how we partner – shifting from traditional, transactional-style partnerships to ones that bring together multiple partners from across a company’s value chain, among peer groups, with government and civil society. With Seth Green, founding director of the Baumhart Center, an interdisciplinary center at Loyola University Chicago that prepares leaders to tackle society’s most pressing challenges, we created a “How To” video for companies on how to partner for transformational change.

The global pandemic is far from over and the consequences will be felt for many years to come. Business Fights Poverty will continue to play a key role in helping businesses to respond to threats, build trust, and connect partners for purposeful collaboration. It’s crucial that we leverage the learnings and changes brought on by COVID-19 to forge ahead into the Decade of Action to improve millions of lives by 2030.

The group is expected to develop a plan of action for the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021) and beyond.

The Gender Advisory Group was constituted to inform the Presidency’s work in mainstreaming gender equality and women’s empowerment throughout the UNGA.

As announced on 22 October 2020, the members are:

Jukka Salovaara, President, UN Women Executive Board

Nahla Valji, Senior Gender Advisor to UN Secretary-General

Sanda Ojiambo, UN Global Compact Executive Director

Dubravka Simonovic, Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women

Patricia Torsney, Inter-parliamentary Union Permanent Observer

The Group will begin meeting on 10 November 2020.

In 2017, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched a UN system-wide strategy to address gender parity. It provides a roadmap for reaching gender parity within the UN’s senior levels of leadership by 2021 and across the UN by 2028. The strategy addresses setting targets, special measures, senior appointments, mission settings, and the enabling environment and organizational culture. A dashboard tracks progress towards gender parity, using the latest gender balance data.

At a meeting of the Group of Friends of Gender Parity in March 2020 Guterres reported that the UN had reached parity in the Senior Management Group, among Resident Coordinators, and among all full-time senior leaders (Assistant Secretaries-General and Under-Secretaries-General), not including the specialized agencies. He identified several steps that need to be taken next to make further progress, and requested Member States’ support.

330,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-synthesizes-messages-from-47-vnrs-presented-in-2020/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,DESA Synthesizes Messages from 47 VNRs Presented in 2020,"The UN has released a synthesis report of the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) conducted in 2020. A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

In September 2020, DESA released a synthesis of the 2020 VNRs with a specific focus on the reported impacts of COVID-19 in each country.

This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

The outcome will be sent to the upcoming fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, at the opening of the meeting, officials drew attention to the impacts of COVID-19 on single-use plastics, noting in particular the burden on waste management posed by disposable masks and other personal protective equipment that contains plastic.

Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream” activities will be needed to prevent pollution.

Delegates discussed a stocktaking conducted by the Secretariat of current actions on marine litter and microplastics, and considered the effectiveness of current responses to the problem. The Secretariat found a predominance of “downstream” efforts that are performed at the national and sub-national level, and focused overwhelmingly on awareness-raising activities and beach-clean-ups. Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream activities” related to pollution prevention are going to be key to addressing this challenge.

The Group agreed to a Chair’s summary, which was hailed as a neutral and factual document and contained a “non-exhaustive list of response options to marine litter and microplastics.” They annexed the summary to the report of the meeting, which will be presented to delegates at UNEA-5. Delegates supported the summary as a balance of views shared during the entire AHEG process, acknowledging that the document was not a negotiated outcome. However, several reiterated their hope that the summary would include stronger language on the need to establish a negotiating process towards a new global agreement on plastic pollution.

UNEA-5 is expected to consider these options, including whether to endorse a global agreement, when it convenes virtually in February 2021.

333,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-risk-of-losing-the-2030-agenda-in-brazil/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Risk of Losing the 2030 Agenda in Brazil,"By Alessandra Nilo and Claudio Fernandes

COVID-19 found a perfect storm in Brazil, which has the sixth-largest population in the world and the seventh-highest level of inequality.

The health and economic crises triggered by the pandemic have exposed our multiple inequalities. While Brazil’s population is now paying the high price of pandemic unpreparedness and government irresponsibility, the planet is bound to pay an even longer-lasting price for environmental recklessness and devastation.

This warning comes from 105 specialists from the Civil Society Working Group for the 2030 Agenda in the latest Spotlight Report on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Brazil, which monitors the implementation of the SDGs. This fourth edition is based on the analysis of 145 of the 169 global SDG targets. The report shows that there is no progress in 88% of the environmental targets – only two out of 91 show progress. In addition, more than a third show regression, another third is either threatened or stagnant, and 17.6% of them have no data available.

Environmental Issues: Worsening Statistics, Shrinking Resources

Deforestation hit a record level this year, increasing by 35% in the Amazon (between June 2019 and June 2020) and 30% in the tropical Atlantic Forest, which had already lost 75% of its area throughout history. While 43 million people were hit by droughts, the 2019 budget on disaster prevention was the lowest in 11 years, and less than a third of it was disbursed.

The report shows also an increase in pollution, land grabbing conflicts, and violence against indigenous people and human rights defenders. In this context, it must take a great deal of disregard for governing for the current administration to cut bodies of democratic governance, keep civil society out of discussions, and lose international partners in the Amazonian Protection Fund, which resulted in stopping disbursement for projects led by CSOs[1].

Moreover, due to the administration’s lack of transparency, we do not have recent data on subsidies for fossil fuels, internal consumption of solid materials, or the amount of hazardous waste generated or disposed.

Economic and Social Issues: Less Public Money, More Inequality

The pandemic is highlighting the consequences of fiscal austerity policies. As those policies were implemented, legislation that increases inequality was simultaneously reinforced. A 2016 constitutional amendment established a cap on public investment in health, education, science and technology, and social assistance, effectively transferring wealth from the bottom to financial investors for the resources cut from the programmes used to pay off debt interests. It is not surprising that, of the 85 SDG targets linked to the social dimension analyzed in the report, 68% show no advancement whatsoever in the last two years (2018-2019).

In 2019, when 77 million people (37% of the population) lacked access to basic sanitation and unemployment, and job informality rose sharply, only 1.26% of Brazil’s federal budget targeted poverty reduction programmes, the same ratio since 2016. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) will have to update its hunger map because, according to our National Statistical and Geographic Institute (IBGE), hunger in Brazil reached more than 5% of the population for the first time since 2013.

Other social indicators are also worrying, including:

Brazil is the fourth, in absolute numbers, in child marriage and sexual abuse cases against children and adolescents. In 2019, these were the highest since 2011[2].

Violence against women and LGBTI+ population increased, while the budget for the VAW Program decreased 75% in the past five years.

HIV infections have increased in the North and Northeast regions (the poorest ones) and follow a pattern that points to structural racism: black people make up 60% of the deaths associated with HIV in these regions.

Governance Issues: Perceptions, Rights, and Regulations

Corruption in Brazil has worsened for three years in a row, based on citizens’ perceptions. In 2019, out of 180 countries, Brazil occupied the 106th position in the Corruption Perception Index, and saw a 20.1% increase in deaths from police intervention alongside the dismantling of the social participation policy: the National SDG Commission created in 2016 was dissolved by Presidential Decree 9.759 in April 2019. This decree also affected approximately 500 commissions and councils that had the participation of civil society representatives.

The Brazilian federal administration is openly opposed to the 2030 Agenda, as evidenced by its deregulating policies, weakening environmental protection agencies, and denying science and the climate emergency. The latest attack on the SDGs was published on 26 October 2020: Presidential Decree 10.531/2020 replaces the 2030 Agenda with the Federal Strategic Development Plan 2031. The plan seeks to justify a proposed regressive tax reform, policies of privatization for health and education, and social exclusion by reinforcing the traditional binary family arrangement, among other things[3].

It is symptomatic that while we are experiencing an extraordinary public health event, specialists are being replaced by unqualified military personnel. The current Minister of Health – Brazil’s third since February – is an Army General ready to follow the science-denying orders from the President.

Many of the rights-based accords currently in the multilateral arena were negotiated with leadership and participation of the Brazilian diplomatic corps. These same agreements are under threat at the national level, a situation that affects people and planet beyond our own borders. Losing Brazil on the path to sustainable development and environmental responsibility is a risk neither Latin America nor the world can afford, especially in this accelerated Decade of Action.

Will COVID-19 push the SDGs to the back of the global agenda, or will it underscore the persistent need for sustainable development? The answer depends in part on how the 2030 Agenda survives this “stress test” of its first five years. In our latest article, published in Journal of International Business Policy, we look into this question, and suggest three ways for the SDGs to help make societies more equitable after COVID-19.

COVID-19: A Stress Test for the SDGs

COVID-19 is exposing the true relevance of the SDGs. Before the pandemic, assessments on how the world is doing on achieving the SDGs already painted a bleak picture of widening inequality, more hunger, alarming erosion of ecosystems and biodiversity loss, and continued global warming.

Prioritizing economic growth over social inclusion and the environment undermines the “systems logic” of the SDGs.

COVID-19 further deteriorates progress: the resulting economic crisis is estimated to push 400 million people into abject poverty, meaning they will have to get by on less than USD1.90 a day. Moreover, the disruption of food value chains is estimated to double the number of people likely to face acute food shortages to 265 million. And as the virus is particularly affecting people living in poverty and those with underlying health conditions, COVID-19 is expected to exacerbate inequality.

Scientists have suggested that two-thirds of the SDGs are unlikely to be met amid a pandemic, and countries therefore should better define their priorities, and focus on a few broad strategic goals rather than all 17 SDGs. The editorial team of Nature added that it now is time to revise the SDGs to make them more achievable. This criticism echoes an early critique from the Copenhagen Consensus group that the 2030 Agenda has too many goals and too few priorities.

Others are not so sure. One group of scientists stated, also in Nature, that “great feats are rarely a product of lowered ambition” and the pandemic only “reinforces why the goals were established in the first place: to chart a better course towards common economic, social and environmental ambitions that will guarantee humanity’s long-term future.” The UN itself underscores this position and has not suggested revising or narrowing the sustainable development agenda. On the contrary, it has doubled down on the SDGs, asserting that they are “vital for a [COVID-19] recovery that leads to greener, more inclusive economies, and stronger, more resilient societies.”

Therefore, although it is good to remain critical about the design of the SDGs, they are likely to represent the best framework for navigating societies through the pandemic, and towards resilience and sustainability. COVID-19 is truly a stress test for the SDGs in general, and its universal and integrative ambitions in particular.

The Three-Part Logic of the SDGs

We argue that the SDGs provide three distinct “logics” that could help make societies more equitable after COVID-19. After the SDGs were adopted in 2015, a wave of reports, road maps, websites, and research papers investigated how the Goals could best be achieved. This has increased the world community’s intelligence on how to create more sustainable and resilient societies.

In our paper, we identify three types of logic illustrated by the SDGs: (1) a governance logic, (2) a systems logic, and (3) a strategic logic. These could facilitate a sustainable transformation during this crisis and beyond. But each faces significant hurdles.

Source: van Zanten & van Tulder (2020)

First, according to the governance logic of the SDGs, progress takes place by setting policy goals at the macro level, creating policies to achieve them, and measuring progress over time. The 2030 Agenda provides 17 SDGs with 169 targets and 232 approved indicators to guide this process. Policies are increasingly being formulated to achieve these. Vast data gaps in measuring progress remain, but they are gradually filled.

The way many governments have been dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, with ad hoc and fragmented approaches, has actually created a key hurdle for effective action. Short-term priorities may get in the way of maintaining the needed longer-term focus. In our paper, we discuss the diverging approaches of the EU (more holistic) and US (more fragmented) in setting longer-term policy objectives and their influence on the SDGs.

Second, the SDGs’ systems logic works through the interactions between SDGs, in which contributions to one SDG can advance progress on another SDG or target, but they can also undermine progress on other targets or goals. Tackling sustainable development challenges requires targeting the interactions between the SDGs rather than focusing on individual goals. A quick analysis issued by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in July 2020 shows both the impacts of the pandemic on many SDGs, and that the SDG framework can help map wider systemic effects of a crisis.

The main hurdle facing this logic is that SDGs that drive economic growth are given priority over SDGs aimed at social inclusion and environmental sustainability. It would be useful to pursue more targeted approaches that look into the net impacts of each type of economic activity.

Third, the SDGs feature a strategic logic. This works by actively involving private companies in sustainable development. Most major companies have responded supportively to the adoption of the Goals and begun to incorporate them in their operations and communications. Yet companies face a real hurdle in moving from intention to realization: they need to improve their impacts. Crossing this hurdle requires companies to integrate the SDGs into their entire organization, rather than positioning the goals in CSR or communications departments, and to measure and report on the results.

Outlook

Milton Friedman once famously said: “Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.”

In our paper, we argued that there are a number of interesting and relevant ideas constituting our SDG intelligence, that can help us move beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability and resilience. We only must avoid a parsimonious approach of focusing on separate elements of the 2030 Agenda at the expense of others, to ensure we do not throw away the child (the collective intelligence build-up) with the bathwater (crisis management).

The briefing focused on two recent reports from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Presentations included remarks from the UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, a role established 25 years ago due to growing concern about the dumping in Africa of hazardous waste generated in Europe.

Held on 20 October 2020, the briefing provided an opportunity to discuss: a report on issues of concern, detailing eight emerging policy issues and other issues of concern identified under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), and reviewing how regulatory and policy frameworks address them; and a report on strengthening the science-policy interface for chemicals and waste management, which assesses three options for such an interface: an independent platform; institutionalizing outlook development processes; and thematic subsidiary panels with specialized task forces. UNEP developed the reports in response to requests by the fourth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) for consideration at UNEA-5.

Marcos Orellana, UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, said the science-policy interface is particularly important regarding human rights implications of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. He said the “right to science” in the human rights field is anchored in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

He said criteria for a successful SPI in this area include credibility and independence, as well as transparency to prevent conflict of interest. He also highlighted the private sector’s role in the work of existing science-policy platforms in chemicals and waste, as well as the need to protect against inappropriate corporate influence. Orellana said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): preserves the integrity of the scientific debate; keeps discussions transparent; and enables access to the scientific evidences in which the assessments are based.

In response to questions from participants, Orellana also discussed disclosure of information by manufacturers. He highlighted: the complexity of balancing the benefits of scientific progress with intellectual property rights (IPRs); the need for governments to establish regulatory mechanisms to ensure access to information; and risks that platforms may be captured by special interests.

Felix Wertli, Switzerland, said the most effective SPI option for Switzerland is an intergovernmental panel, which would best prevent conflicts of interest and ensure scientific integrity. Speakers also pointed out that:

The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS) have embedded SPI mechanisms, such as the POPs Review Committee under the Stockholm Convention, and expert working groups, for example on plastic and on e-waste, under the Basel Convention;

Digital tools are important to maximize the impact of SPI platforms; and

Virtual working groups have been established during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure discussions continue on the post-2020 framework for chemicals and waste management.

Discussions also addressed the current model of the Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO), adopted at UNEA, and its deficiencies regarding strengthening the SPI.

Participants raised the need to strike a balance in the post-2020 instrument, including regarding funding, between the high-level, research/policy-oriented aspects and on-the-ground efforts on issues of concern. Exchanges also touched on technology transfer and institutional strengthening in developing countries, including through UNEP’s Special Programme on Institutional Strengthening for the Chemicals Cluster, which helps developing countries access funding and develop sound plans for managing chemicals and waste. [SDG Knowledge Hub sources]","The human rights implications of chemicals and waste management were a topic of interest at a briefing organized by the Geneva Environment Network (GEN).
Presentations included remarks from the UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, a role established 25 years ago due to growing concern about the dumping in Africa of hazardous waste generated in Europe.
Marcos Orellana, UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, said the science-policy interface is particularly important regarding human rights implications of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
He said the “right to science” in the human rights field is anchored in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C scenario.

The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.

There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.

Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.

A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.

“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”

The Protocol is available for comment for one month, from 13 October till 13 November.

Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, launched by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020. The Framework was developed with 70 leading global investors representing USD 16 trillion in assets. [Publication: Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol] [UNEP FI Press Release]

Annemarie Hou, acting executive director of the UN office for partnerships, said this is a critical time to “accelerate partnerships to address the world’s biggest challenges — from eliminating poverty, hunger and inequalities to reversing climate change and unsustainable consumption and production practices.”

Hou noted that the fashion industry “is an important ally for the United Nations in this Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs by 2030.”

Organizers said the Discover the SDGs event is underwritten by Arch and Hook, Artistic Milliners and Lenzing with support from Interwoven, ITL Group and Orta. The event “serves as a catalyst for a new era of fashion; exploring the intersection of the SDGs and fashion business including climate action, gender equality, industry innovation, digitization, life of land and responsible production and consumption,” organizers said.

Tricia Carey, director of global business development at Lenzing, noted, that, “As we close out a tumultuous 2020, we have optimism for a new year with a path to recover better together. Discover the SDG’s by the Conscious Fashion Campaign provides the fashion industry with the tools to make educated choices with regards to both the environment and society.”

Carey said Lenzing uses the SDGs as a “framework for our initiatives to be a responsible wood-based cellulosic fiber producer making Tencel, Lyocell and Modal.”

Murtaza Ahmed, owner and managing director of Artistic Milliners, stressed the importance of partnerships and collaboration to advance the SDGs. He said he believes “any one entity alone cannot rely on fragmented work to achieve global impact.”

“Therefore, we are leveraging the power of SDGs as the most comprehensive framework of collective action to bring about real impact,” Ahmed explained. “Our efforts have led to our recognition by the United Nations Global Compact as the Global Pioneer of SDG 5: Gender Equality. We want to share our best practices with our peers and partners and the Conscious Fashion Campaign provides the perfect platform to inspire the global fashion industry to action.”","The Conscious Fashion Campaign, which is an initiative founded by social entrepreneur Kerry Bannigan to “accelerate fashion industry action in support of the Sustainable Development Goals,” has launched a monthlong “virtual educational experience” that is in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Partnerships.

The intergovernmental review was originally mandated to take place during the 74th UNGA session (2019-2020), to reflect on the HLPF’s “first cycle” and to consider strengthening ECOSOC. The review was launched in February 2020. Member States exchanged views on the scope of the ECOSOC review, critical issues to be addressed in the reviews, ways to improve the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process and thematic follow-up and review, and how to include stakeholders in the thematic reviews.

Priorities that emerged in consultations for the HLPF review (according to the ECOSOC President) included:

More time should be provided during the annual HLPF sessions for the presentation of VNRs;

Changes should be considered to improve the “in-depth reviews” of each SDG, including examining the 17 Goals in a holistic and integrated manner; and

The political guidance role of the HLPF should be enhanced.

In April 2020, consultations were postponed until the 75th session (2020-2021) in order to hold in-depth discussions “after the most acute aspects of the COVID-19 crisis have been addressed and the United Nations has resumed its normal operations.”

In August 2020, the UNGA agreed that the review process should: account for the impact of COVID-19 on the 17 SDGs; consider progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda; address the interlinkages between Goals, to “promote integrated actions cutting across the three dimensions of sustainable development that can create co-benefits, address synergies and trade-offs and meet multiple objectives in a coherent manner, leaving no one behind”; and cover the SDG targets with a 2020 timeline.

In a joint declaration the Banks pledge to align financing decisions with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The Summit took place virtually from 9-12 November 2020. It was organized by the Government of France in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will be marked in December 2020. It was also envisioned as a key milestone ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26), the UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), and the Generation Equality Forum.

The organizers noted that public development banks provide the funding for large infrastructure projects in the energy sector, among others, and are key for redirecting finance from projects that rely on fossil fuels to lower-carbon projects. Public development banks make 10% of all global investments from public and private sources.

The banks issued a joint declaration pledging to increase their focus on the climate emergency. The signatories “commit to align our activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to reach zero net emissions as early as possible. The Banks also “will mainstream resilience and adaptation in our strategies and operations and enhance action to fund the definition and implementation of national adaptation plans. We will help redirect private financial flows in support of low-carbon and climate-resilient sustainable development.”

Pledges also address: the energy transition; biodiversity, oceans, and nature; health; gender equality; digitalization; and leaving no one behind. The declaration highlights the need for a “global framework for SDG-compatible finance.” Further on SDG financing, it supports the convergence of practices towards “core standards” set out in the 2018 report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance. The declaration cites instruments to shift more investment to sustainable assets, such as by using a shadow price of carbon and providing information on SDG reporting.

The declaration ends with a section on “the road ahead,” which notes that the second Finance in Common meeting will be convened in 2021 to take stock of the first initiatives and set up a method for monitoring progress on the declaration.

Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP), said that building on the pledge, the governments that fund each public development bank must ensure their mandates tie lending practices to lower emissions.

Before the Summit, a group of European development banks issued a separate pledge to phase out fossil fuel investments, and said they will work towards a stronger position on investment in coal in time for COP 26.

340,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/data-experts-seek-to-resolve-tension-around-non-official-sources/,"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Data Experts Discuss How to Harness Non-Official Sources,"During a side event at the recent UN World Data Forum, organized by GeoCensos, experts discussed ways to harness statistics produced by sources other than countries’ national statistical offices (NSOs). These non-official sources include the private sector, civil society, academia, and other research institutions.

Javier Andrés Carranza Torres, Director of GeoCensos, opened the event titled ‘Learning from open geodata platforms that worked in the midst of a pandemic.’ He noted that data experts are concerned about both quality and disaggregation of data in geospatial hubs during the pandemic. He noted that SDG 17 contains targets on partnering with the data community.

Steve MacFeely, Chief Statistician for the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), reminded virtual participants that at the 2018 World Data Forum held in Dubai, UAE, the resulting declaration said the data demands of the 2030 Agenda “require urgent new solutions to leverage the power of new data sources and technologies.” The Dubai Declaration explained this should be done through partnerships among official and non-official sources of data. Realizing that aspiration is the present challenge for the data and statistical community, MacFeely said.

The easiest SDG indicators have been populated; we have to work hard to populate the remaining ones.

He reported on the inadequate state of the SDG indicators, noting that approximately only half of them can be populated, and those are the easiest to populate. “The low-hanging fruit has been picked; now we have to work hard to populate the remaining indicators.” Therefore, SDG indicators should be compiled not just from data but also statistics, as long as an accreditation system can be established.

On sharing non-official data, MacFeely cautioned that an asymmetry could result from pressuring the public sector to share its data while “allowing the private sector to escape” and harvest public data for their own purposes. MacFeely’s presentation was based the second edition of ‘SDG Pulse,’ an UNCTAD report updated in July 2020.

Olga Henker, Data Quality Conformity Organization Body (GCC), highlighted data certification frameworks such as ISO/IEC 25012 or ISO 19115. She said during the pandemic, comprehensive, reliable, and readily available data are needed for business continuity, monitoring and predicting the pandemic’s developments, and accelerating digital transformation. The GCC proposes that unofficial statistics are only used when all official options have been exhausted. She expressed support for the potential certification of unofficial data for use at NSOs, with suggestions including that:

“certifications should be supported by previously accredited conformity assessment bodies” as designated by governments and “enriched with” NSO advice; and

NSOs help promote a culture of certification, in anticipation of “an imminent data revolution.” She called for democratizing the quality of data both in the product and in the process.

Luca Di Gennaro Splendore, statistical consultant, said the pandemic had disrupted the production of official data. This had yielded lessons: short, timely analysis is more appreciated than large studies. And granular, non-traditional sources can help pinpoint emerging needs. He said the pandemic can lead to the updating of routines, replacing inflexible, official procedures with up-to-date analysis, experimental statistics, and complementary granular data sources.

Beth Timmers, IISD, discussed the role of granular community data in recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. She said communities are the experts on how shocks affect them. To reconcile the tension about ensuring that community data is high-quality, she pointed to IISD’s Tracking Progress tool. The digital platform collates data that communities have deemed important, meaning that different data sources are used to track the same indicators.

Speakers held an in-depth discussion of how “open data” can include many different kinds of data, including qualitative research, which could be made official through venues such as a third-party certification process. Timmers expressed concern that a top-down certification process to legitimize data could simply continue marginalizing civil society input. The certification must be an inclusive process that engages community organizations, she stressed. An example from Canada is the experience of First Nation groups who say they have not been included in SDG implementation or data collection, and the framework is instead “implemented onto them.”

Providing an NSO perspective, Grace Bediako highlighted Ghana’s ground-breaking use of anonymized and aggregated mobile/cell phone data to help produce official statistics. The data is collected through a public-private partnership with Vodafone Ghana and the Flowminder Foundation, and is useful for providing insights on Ghanaians’ mobility, which relates to planning on public health, disasters, and recently responses to COVID-19.

Enrique Pelaez, CONICET (Argentina), moderated the question-and-answer session. The session was part of the three-day WDF programme that convened virtually from 19-21 October 2020. In a statement launched at the conclusion of the Forum, participants supported an “evidence-based response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” and noted the demand for data and statistics are greater than ever. They outlined a response that includes:

Creating data to leave no one behind by continuing to develop disaggregation in data to mainstream gender equality, and define common standards and tools to ensure that everyone is counted;

Developing capacity to modernize data systems not only at the national level, but also at the local and subnational levels, especially among lower-income and more vulnerable countries; and

Encouraging the establishment of more data partnerships, whether public-public or public-private, to work on new data sources, tools, and platforms to increase data availability and complement basic statistical infrastructure.

341,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/webinar-explores-role-of-voluntary-sustainability-standards-in-achieving-sdgs/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Webinar Explores Role of Voluntary Sustainability Standards in Achieving SDGs,"The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the University of Geneva’s Faculty of Law organized a webinar to explore how voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) across a range of commodities could be integrated into trade agreements, market access regulations, export promotion measures, and procurement policy to advance sustainability goals.

Part of a joint series on trade and sustainability, the 10 November webinar focused on the theme, ‘Voluntary Sustainability Standards, Public Procurement, and Trade Policy: Trends, Challenges, and Development Implications.’ Participants also discussed the implications of integrating such standards into trade policy, in particular for developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs).

Cristina Larrea, Lead, Sustainability Standards, IISD, moderated the discussion. She said the webinar built on a report titled, ‘Scaling up VSS through Sustainable Public Procurement and Trade Policy,’ produced by the UN Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS), in collaboration with the University of Leuven (Belgium).

Larrea defined VSS as initiatives that support industry actors in making informed decisions to advance sustainability, and highlighted that while not mandatory, VSS can act as de facto requirements. She noted that according to IISD’s Global Market Report, VSS-compliant production in commodities such as cocoa, cotton, coffee, and palm oil, grew between 2008-2018, reaching an estimated 20-30% of total production volume.

Santiago Fernandez de Cordoba, UNFSS, outlined the role of VSS as a tool to transform the way we are producing, consuming, and trading. He said UNFSS aims to harness VSS’ potential to achieve the SDGs by: facilitating developing countries’ access to global markets, stimulating well-informed dialogue among stakeholders, and elevating capacities for producers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and exporters who can be marginalized by VSS in global trade.

De Cordoba highlighted five proposals to integrate VSS into public policy:

Enhance national capacity;

Incorporate VSS within the trade regime by using the Standard International Trade Classification;

Avoid proliferation of VSS systems through mutual recognition mechanisms;

Curb over-certification; and

Conduct policy dialogue on the benefits of scaling up VSS.

Axel Marx, University of Leuven, highlighted the role of governments in facilitating the adoption and use of VSS through sustainable public procurement (SPP) to drive sustainable development. He recommended that in their efforts to integrate VSS in SPP, government buyers prioritize credible VSS over non-credible ones. Marx pointed to the emergence of VSS references in free trade agreements (FTAs), and said governments could use VSS as a conditionality in market regulation and export promotion.

Liesbeth Casier, Policy Advisor, IISD, said in order to ensure that VSS deliver on their full potential for SPP, it is important to address implementation, procurement agencies’ ability to determine what is sustainable, and compliance verification, among other issues. She underscored the need to ensure that “sustainability does not become a burden” and that public policy for VSS does not “crowd out” SMEs, which are crucial for job creation. Casier said governments can take complementary actions to ensure that SMEs have access to the SPP market by using e-procurement systems and introducing quotas for contracts to be awarded to SMEs, among other actions.

Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Senior Director, Economic Law and Policy, IISD, highlighted that while “trade and environment discussions are picking up again,” including in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and FTAs increasingly incorporate environmental provisions, few contain references to VSS. She highlighted the planned Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), where VSS encourage the promotion and application of ecolabels that are transparent in their criteria and meaningful for consumers. Bernasconi-Osterwalder warned that costly labeling and certification measures may cause developing country producers to lose market access, and recommended that countries undertake ex ante impact assessments of FTAs.

Responding to questions from the audience, participants discussed regulatory versus non-regulatory aspects of VSS, the benefits of mutual recognition between VSS, the need for multiple VSS labels to prevent monopolies, and the role of complementary policies in ensuring that VSS do not marginalize developing countries and SMEs.

In closing, Makane Moïse Mbengue, Professor of International Law, University of Geneva, stressed the importance of cooperation on enhancing developing countries’ capacities to ensure that VSS help them achieve the SDGs.

It provides practical information on steps that countries may take when preparing VNRs, presenting the VNR report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and following up after the HLPF.

VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Conducted voluntarily by national governments, the reviews are intended to track progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs at the country level, and comprise part of the follow-up and review of the Agenda. Since 2016, 205 VNRs have been presented by 168 countries. For the 2021 session, 43 countries are expected to present a VNR.

The 2021 VNR handbook was released in November 2020 as an updated version of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 editions. The 2021 edition recommends that countries include a section on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDG implementation, measures undertaken to ensure a sustainable, green recovery, and impacts on VNR preparations.

The handbook notes that the ten countries conducting their first VNR will be allocated 30 minutes. These countries are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and San Marino.

The 33 countries presenting second and third VNRs will present them in a panel format with 20 minutes each during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF. Twenty-four countries are conducting their second reviews: Bahamas, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, Chad, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Namibia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Nine countries are conducting their third reviews: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The handbook makes specific recommendations for countries preparing a VNR for the second or third time, including that countries should show progress made since their first VNR, and avoid repeating information presented in a previous VNR. The handbook encourages countries to address how they overcome challenges in SDG implementation and share lessons learned and good practices adopted.

On UN support for countries’ VNR preparations, the handbook notes that DESA is organizing three global workshops for working-level officials closely engaged in the national preparatory process, as follows:

October-November 2020: A virtual workshop to facilitate peer learning and exchange between countries conducting VNRs in 2021 and those that have previously carried out VNRs, as well as to cover key components of the preparatory process;

Spring 2021: In-depth exchanges on the preparation and presentation process, drafting sections of the VNR report, and presenting the VNR report; and

On 11 July 2021 in New York, US, a workshop covering final preparatory matters and addressing anticipated follow-up to the VNRs.

In addition, the five UN Regional Commissions are expected to organize workshops on the margins of their respective regional sustainable development fora to discuss regional specificities and lessons learned by previous VNR countries.

On deadlines, governments must submit main messages – the principal findings of the review – by 2 May 2021. The final VNR report is due on 11 June 2021.

The handbook concludes with suggestions for concrete follow-up steps after the HLPF. These include: presenting outcomes of the VNR presentation at the HLPF in a press conference; debriefing the VNR project team on the outcomes of the HLPF presentation; and sharing the VNR at the regional level. Further, the handbook suggests that countries promote concrete action on priorities contained in the VNR, such as through convening a cabinet meeting to consider VNR follow-up, and developing an action plan or road map that addresses the “who, what, where and when” of priority actions.

The 2021 HLPF is scheduled to convene from 6-15 July.

The 2020 Leaders’ Summit focused on the theme, ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All by Empowering People, Safeguarding the Planet, and Shaping New Frontiers.’

The ‘G20 Riyadh Summit’ convened virtually from 21-22 November. The Saudi G20 Presidency focused on issues including structural inequalities and debt repayments at a time when resources are needed to address the pandemic and ensure sustainable development.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G20 Leaders commit to leading the world in shaping a “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-COVID-19 era,” and emphasize the importance of “coordinated global action, solidarity and multilateral cooperation” to overcome current challenges and realize opportunities for all by “empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.” The Declaration focuses on four areas:

rising to the challenge together to address the pandemic, including through implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI;

building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, including points on health, trade and investment, and other financial topics;

ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities, including points related to sustainable development, access to opportunities, employment, women’s empowerment, education, tourism, and migration and forced displacement; and

ensuring a sustainable future, through work on environment, energy and climate, agriculture, and water.

A G20 press release notes that the G20 DSSI will provide the poorest and most vulnerable countries with “urgent and immediate liquidity relief from official bilateral creditors.” The Initiative provides USD 14 billion in 2020 to tackle the pandemic and its economic and social impacts. In addition, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working to provide US 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries between April and December 2020, as part of a broader USD 230 billion package for low-income and emerging countries. According to the release, G20 countries have also provided USD 21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, and over USD 1 trillion to support the global economy.

On building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, leaders addressed, inter alia:

the importance of tackling health and global pandemic preparedness, prevention, detection and response and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases based on a One Health approach;

trade and investment, including endorsing the G20 Actions to Support World Trade and Investment on the Future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recognizing the contribution of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO in allowing an additional opportunity to discuss and reaffirm the objectives and principles of the multilateral trading system (MTS) and to demonstrate ongoing political support for WTO reform. Leaders further recognize the need to increase the sustainability and resilience of supply chains to foster the integration of developing and least developed countries (LDCs) into the trading system and to promote inclusive economic growth, including through increased participation of micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in international trade and investment;

transportation and travel, including ensuring that global transportation routes and supply chains remain open, safe and secure;

international finance architecture, including a commitment to continue the process of International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform and an invitation to the IMF to prepare an analysis of external financing needs in low-income developing countries in future years, outlining sustainable options;

financial sector issues, such as a commitment to the Financial Stability Board’s principles underpinning national and international responses to COVID-19 and a work plan to improve the resilience of the non-bank financial sector;

digital economy, recognizing that universal, affordable, and secure connectivity is a key enabler for the digital economy and a catalyst for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and innovation;

international taxation; and

anti-corruption, including welcoming the first G20 Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting and endorsing the G20 Call to Action on Corruption and COVID-19.

On ensuring a sustainable future, leaders committed to safeguarding the planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all, including through conserving the marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Leaders launched the Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to conserve coral reefs and the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. They reaffirmed commitment to reduce marine plastic litter and to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Leaders further recognized the importance of expediting universal access to affordable and reliable energy for all, and endorsed the Circular Carib Economy Platform.

Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities.

Addressing the Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres outlined three key areas where G20 leadership is key to building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future:

halting the further spread of the pandemic;

mobilizing the resources to build forward better; and

aligning recovery efforts with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.

He said we have a “moral obligation” to ensure that the trillions of dollars “we are borrowing from future generations” for COVID‑19 recovery “does not leave them burdened by a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

In an address, WTO Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff identified three challenges facing WTO members: using trade to boost the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; facilitating trade in essential medical products needed to treat the pandemic; and reforming institutions that govern global trade, including restoring the WTO’s deliberative and negotiating functions and providing binding dispute settlement. He said a trade finance initiative should be seen as an essential part of economic recovery, and urged the G20 to support WTO action on economic recovery, pandemic response, and WTO reform.

The G20 brings together some of the largest economies, amounting to around 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic global issues. The G20 consists of 19 countries and the EU. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Turkey, the UK, and the US. In 2020, Spain, Jordan, Singapore, and Switzerland were invited as guest countries.

345,https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/323894/world-risk-poll-provides-compass-sdg-road-map.aspx,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gallup Poll,World Risk Poll Provides a Compass for the SDG Road Map,"The 17 goals that make up the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) build on the earlier success of the Millennium Development Goals and provide a framework for policymakers and others to use to focus global development ambitions. The 169 targets and 231 unique indicators that quantify each of the 17 goals provide a multidimensional lens to view the development challenges that each of the goals tackles.

The SDG indicators are extensive, but the indicators themselves do not have a hierarchy. This makes it challenging for policymakers to determine what needs to be prioritized. The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas the following open-ended question: ""In your own words, what is the greatest source of RISK TO YOUR SAFETY in your daily life?""

With road-related hazards topping the list, the World Risk Poll data clearly highlight the significance of SDG 11.2: ""By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety.""

Bar chart. In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas to name their biggest source of risk in their lives. Road-related injuries were mentioned most often.

Despite some of the successes of the World Health Organization's decade of action for road safety, road traffic injuries are still the leading cause of death among young people aged 5 to 29. The World Risk Poll reinforces calls for a second decade of action, to double down on activities to address this self-identified greatest global risk.

Although road safety is the most frequently given response to the ""greatest risk"" question, residents of countries that have the lowest numbers of road traffic fatality rates per hundred thousand are those most likely to report road safety as the greatest issue.

Bar chart. Percentage worldwide who name road-related hazards as the top risk to their daily lives, according to country income group and traffic fatality rates.

The individual country-level data provide insights into what underpins this apparent contradiction. Madagascar, the country with the lowest levels of road safety reported as the ""greatest risk,"" has 28.6 deaths attributable to road safety per 100,000, about six times greater than Finland, which -- at 4.7 per 100,000 -- is the country with the highest levels of road safety reported as the largest risk.

The prevalence of more-pressing risks to daily life in lower-income countries such as Madagascar helps explain why people in lower-income countries and territories were less likely to mention road-related risks than people in higher-income countries. People living in low-income economies often face extreme poverty, poor infrastructure and weak public services, all of which form relatively more immediate threats to safety in daily life than road- and traffic-related risks.

Therefore, these threats may overshadow road-related risks despite the statistics that show how many people are injured in road accidents. This is true in Madagascar, where crime and violence are the single-largest risks, with 30% of Malagasy mentioning them.

With 12% of people worldwide mentioning crime, violence or terrorism as their top risk, people in Madagascar are hardly alone in their concerns. It also illustrates why achieving SDG target 16.1, to ""significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere"" is so crucial, and why leaders need a laser focus on indicator 16.1.4 -- the proportion of the population that feels safe walking alone at night where they live.

Based on World Poll data that measure indicator 16.1.4, while Malagasy in 2019 were not the least likely in the world to say they feel safe walking alone at night where they live, they did rank 133rd out of 144 countries on this measure.

Implications

The United Nations' most recent progress report on its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 maintains that, ""conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice"" remain threats to sustainable development. These threats have only been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, further jeopardizing the world's admittedly slow progress toward achieving ""peaceful and inclusive"" societies.

If the SDGs are designed to be a road map to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030, the World Risk Poll provides a complementary compass of how to navigate safely toward that destination.","The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

The Council discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tropical forests and timber, and debated whether to extend the treaty that governs the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).

As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the Council session opened with the preliminary findings of an ITTO study on the impacts of the pandemic on the tropical forest sector and the tropical timber industry. The report notes that the entire timber and forest products sector was affected by severe drops in consumption, production, employment, and trade, but tropical timber and products were hit even harder.

“Many enterprises are failing, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and unemployment, rising poverty, and reverse migration (from urban to rural) is putting new pressure on forests and their resources. Supply chains have been disrupted, and the resulting changes may completely reshape supply and value chains in the post-pandemic period. The bottom line, suggests the ITTO study, is that tropical timber may not recover until 2026,” according to ENB. One delegation noted the need for strong ITTO leadership over the next 12-24 months.

The Council also debated whether to extend the 2006 treaty that governs the ITTO, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006, which is due to expire in December 2021. The treaty expires on 7 December 2021 unless the Council decides to extend, renegotiate, or terminate it.

ENB reports that delegates who spoke indicated support for extending the Agreement for another five years, but some Member States said they would need time to complete domestic and legal consultations before they could formally agree on such a decision. This decision was postponed until ITTC-57, which will meet just before the deadline for the treaty to expire.

The Council also adopted the ITTO Biennial Work Programme for 2021-2022, and decisions on:

the next phase of the ITTO’s New Financing Architecture, instituting a programmatic approach to financing and streamlined project cycle;

the extension of the current ITTO Strategic Action Plan (SAP) through 2021 so the ITTO Secretariat can prepare and present a new draft SAP; and

the selection of the next ITTO Executive Director.

The Council Chair said the adoption of five key decisions during the meeting was due to rebuilt trust between the caucuses and a restored “sense of family” within the ITTO. As reported by ENB, the pledging of USD 3.5 million during ITTC-56, “most of it from ITTO’s traditionally largest donor, Japan, that had withheld donations in the wake of ITTO’s financial impairment scandal, plus the news that some USD 40 million may be forthcoming soon from various pending funding proposals, helped buttress this sense that ITTO is slowly but steadily making its comeback.”

The Council agreed to convene its next session from 2-7 November 2021 in the ITTO host city, Yokohama, Japan.

Her portfolio features a variety of homes in a number of master-planned communities throughout California, and she’s been a member of the SDG team for two decades.

For the last two years she’s focused on Mariner’s Cove, a 7.5-acre master-planned community in Vallejo. Construction of the 175 single-family homes and two parks will begin next year.

“Re-establishing and expanding Vallejo’s connection to the waterfront was a major objective of the project,” she said. “There’s going to be even more public access, park space and amenities for everyone to enjoy. We worked closely with Gates Associates on how our housing designs integrated with their landscape and urban plan, with more accessibility to the waterfront through paseos and trails. Through the project’s view corridors you can see sailboats and the waterfront from several vantage points.”

Mastro holds extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of home design, project entitlements and construction documentation. Her methodical approach ensures her work gets delivered on-time and within the set budget. She’s an advisor to SDG’s project teams, providing guidance and direction to all of the firm’s project managers. Her diligent project management skills allow for trusted and enduring relationships with every client she serves.

She earned her degree in architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and began her career as an intern with SDG Architects in 2000. Now she serves as a principal for the company, overseeing a plethora of projects related to residential design and development. Mastro also mentors up-and-coming designers through Professional Women in Building, a part of the Building Industry Association.

In this interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Mastro talks about her favorite projects, how she stays organized and what she enjoys most about her work.

Q: What are some of your favorite projects you’ve worked on?

A: I’ve designed a variety of housing types in Northern California, including a big new waterfront project in Vallejo for Callahan Development. It’s called Mariner’s Cove and features 175 single-family townhouses and a pair of parks on 7.5 acres near the waterfront. The homes take advantage of their location close to the waterfront and the greenspace corridors. Homes next to paseos have direct access for taking walks or going to the ferry. The homes have garage access via alleyways so you have a really pleasing front-door entry off of paseos and pedestrian oriented streets. We’ve also stepped-back the homes so that they don’t feel tall and imposing next to pedestrian areas.The floor plan layouts, the detailing inside and out, the materials, everything has been designed for modern tastes and needs while also reflecting Vallejo’s neighborhoods and styles. We think Mariners Cove will fit in well and provide much needed housing and recreation space for the community.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?

Details Jennifer Mastro, principal, SDG Architects. Mastro started with the firm as an intern in 2000 and became a principal in 2015. Her portfolio includes homes at the Wilder Ranch community in Orinda and SummerHill Homes development in Mountain View. Most recently she's worked on designs for Mariner's Cove, a 7.5-acre waterfront community of 175 homes in Vallejo which will begin construction next year. Located east of Mt. Diablo in Brentwood, SDG Architects' portfolio includes residential, mixed-use, hospitality and commercial projects. The firm prides itself on sustainable, LEED-certified designs and has more than two decades of experience in the fields of master planning, community development and urban design. See More Collapse

A: We do a lot of homes for developers throughout California. One of our recent projects was Wilder Ranch in Orinda where we designed custom homes for that project. I also helped with the design of three separate projects for SummerHill Homes in Mountain View. These projects are all a learning experience. When we can work with the city and the builders collaboratively we can achieve a high level of design. It can be a little frustrating to get through the process with each city because it’s a learning experience. I’ve found projects turn out nicely when they require a high level of design from our builders.

Q: What’s one of your favorite parts of your job?

A: I enjoy working with different builders, taking a project through entitlement and getting to know each city and what they’re looking for in terms of architectural articulation. I myself enjoy the day-to-day aspects such as entitlements, which is the process where a design goes through the planning department. I’m also very fond of laying the floor plan out. You think a lot about how the home will be used and design it so that it is most beneficial to its owner.

Q: How do you stay organized?

A: I work to keep good notes, and remembering what each city and client might want as their standard keeps me organized. Notes, either handwritten or on the computer, play a major role in staying on task. We’re working on developing more tech-based solutions to stay organized. We have a database with our contacts and project specs, and the technology side makes the information available to everyone, which is especially helpful when you’re not working on-site.

Q: Are there any trends are you noticing about contemporary architecture?

A: I see us thinking more about the way people are living. There’s a big shift towards homes having offices or tech centers or smaller rooms that can be closed off. This is because people are working more from home or have kids who are doing remote learning. That seems to be the design trend of the moment. We have redone floor plans for a lot of our builders, so this might be more of a permanent thing. The most important thing is to listen to the client and learn what they’re trying to achieve.","Energetic, stylish and thoughtful, Jennifer Mastro proves on a daily basis why she’s an integral member of SDG Architects.

Its polycentric, non-hierarchical governance features could be used as a model for other environmental crises.

The brief, authored by Mari Luomi, highlights that multilateral governance of energy remains scarce and fragmented, as does governance of sustainable energy. However, Luomi notes that “there have been some breakthroughs, including the establishment of the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative, the SDGs, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).”

Luomi argues that two major energy challenges must be overcome to achieve sustainable development: energy poverty and climate change. Five decades after the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment recognized the harmful environmental effects of energy production and use, scientists have determined that limiting global warming to safe levels requires leaving at least two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves unburned.

The author recalls that the MDGs did not include an energy- specific goal, possibly because of a “long-standing disagreement between the Global South and North on whether energy was primarily a ‘social and economic good’ or an ‘environmental bad.'” She reports that the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative aimed to refocus the debate by emphasizing both the role of energy in sustainable development and the importance of protecting the environment (McDade, 2013), and its three targets adopted in 2011 influenced the negotiations on SDG 7, amounting to a “rather successful attempt to merge the access and transition agendas into one.”

To achieve SDG 7, the brief says that governments and other stakeholders must form partnerships and coordinate significant transfers of technology and financing, especially to support the most vulnerable. As an early adopter of multi-stakeholder approaches, Luomi concludes, the sustainable energy sector provides positive examples and lessons for other areas of global governance.

As an early adopter of multi-stakeholder approaches, Luomi concludes, the sustainable energy sector provides positive examples and lessons for other areas of global governance.

The 20 October meeting of the Negotiating Group on Rules heard a proposal from Brazil on percentage cuts to subsidies, and discussed the issue of proportionality in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing violations.

Ambassador Santiago Wills (Colombia) introduced a draft consolidated text on 25 June, with the aim of concluding negotiations by the end of 2020, in line with SDG target 14.6. Throughout October, the Negotiating Group of Rules held several rounds of meetings to review the text and propose amendments. During a meeting from 7-8 October, the Group discussed whether and how to define what counts as “fish,” whether to allow subsidies in the aftermath of natural disasters or similar events, how to address maritime disputes, and the issue of territoriality.

On 9 October, heads of delegations met and said a revised version of the draft consolidated text would be helpful. Some members supported continued small group discussions to draft compromise language before presenting it to the wider group, while others expressed concern about not being included in smaller meetings. Members expressed different perspectives on the pace of the negotiations, with some calling for more frequent meetings to conclude negotiations by the end of 2020 and others emphasizing challenges with the current pace and level of coordination needed. One member said the current placeholder for text on requiring members to be transparent about their subsidy programmes should now be expanded.

On 20 October, Brazil introduced a revised proposal to reduce and limit WTO members’ fisheries subsidies, which provides for adjustments to a table of percentage cuts that a member should make based on the size of its fisheries subsidies. The proposal would increase the amount of a subsidy programme shielded from cuts from USD 15 million to 25 million. Members falling under the smallest subsidy bracket, who can also demonstrate small catch volumes and short fishing distances, would have the possibility to add an additional USD 5 million, increasing their total cap to USD 30 million. Brazil said the proposal responds to suggestions and questions from members, and will provide a simple way for members to achieve an ambitious outcome.

Brazil also proposed an expanded negotiation timeline with three stages. The first stage would consist of an agreement on modalities (the percentage cuts and implementation process), and the second would consist of members providing negotiations with their baseline subsidy figure to which reductions would be applied. Brazil’s proposal states that big subsidizers who delay their notification would receive a penalty at this second stage. In a third stage, members with larger subsidy programmes would be expected to respond and adjust their figures if questioned. A final compliance and review would follow these stages.

On proportionality in IUU fishing violations, the Group discussed what criteria for due process, if any, a determination of IUU fishing should meet to trigger a subsidy prohibition and whether subsidy prohibitions should be waived when an IUU fishing infraction is minor.

The Group planned to continue discussing these issues on 21 and 23 October. Clusters of meetings will be held from 2-6 November and from 30 November to 4 December.

These IOAs are in six critical SDG (sustainable development goals) enabling sectors that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development, the UNDP, which works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities through the sustainable development of nations, said in a release.

""India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally. This initiative is an instrumental stride in India''s development trajectory, and I believe it couldn''t have come at a better time. We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India,"" Invest India MD & CEO Deepak Bagla said.

The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said.

It is thus critical to ensure that these pathways are sustainable, resilient and equitable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SDG financing gap has widened by an estimated USD 400 billion in developing countries, adding to the pre-COVID shortfall of USD 2-2.5 trillion per annum, it said.

Whilst the government continues to show strong support for the SDGs and a sustainable recovery, mobilizing this kind of capital and supporting the on-ground innovation needed to meet the SDG targets by 2030, requires the collective efforts of the public and private sector transition from short-term recovery to long-term sustainability, said the release.

The 6 SDG-enabling sectors include education, healthcare, agriculture & allied activities, financial services, renewable energy & alternatives and sustainable environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

This ensured that the Map''s findings were truly reflective of market sentiment, the UNDP said.

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust private equity and venture capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability.

The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors, said the UN development agency.

The UNDP said nearly 50 per cent of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs (internal rate of return) in excess of 20 per cent. While 84 per cent of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Invest India on Friday launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 investment opportunities areas (IOAs).

352,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/2025-plastics-targets-need-faster-action-by-business-government/,"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"2025 Plastics Targets Need Faster Action by Business, Government","The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation issued the second progress report on the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. The 2020 update highlights efforts to incorporate recycled content into plastic packaging and phase out single-use plastic bags and straws. The authors call for an international framework on plastic pollution.

The 2020 progress report towards the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment finds that “much more must be done, and at greater speed” to tackle plastic pollution and achieve the 2025 targets of the Commitment. Although progress has been made on incorporating recycled content in plastic packaging and phasing out the most commonly identified items, like single-use plastic bags and straws, PS and PVC packaging, and undetectable carbon black pigments, there has been limited progress in other areas. Progress is limited on shifting towards reusable packaging and increasing the recyclability of plastic packaging. On eliminating the need for single-use packaging, efforts have focused on a small set of formats and materials, and substituting other plastics or paper rather than reducing the need for single-use packaging.

The report finds “substantial differences in progress between signatories” to the Commitment towards their 2025 targets on a circular economy for plastics. For example:

The Coca-Cola Company is 99% of the way towards achieving its 2025 packaging design target;

Of the signatories for packaged goods and retail, 31% have established targets to reduce virgin plastic in packaging or eliminate plastic packaging;

On reuse, 39% of signatories are testing and piloting models, including a few that reported large numbers of pilots: Natura Cosmetics (24), L’Oreal (22), Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (10) and Unilever (9); and

Other signatories have shown little to no progress on quantitative targets; the report states many businesses will need to accelerate their efforts to meet their 2025 targets.

The report concludes with four calls to action for businesses and governments. Businesses are urged to: take bold action on packaging types that are not recycled today, either decisively innovating away from them or developing and implementing a roadmap to make recycling work; and set ambitious reduction targets that recognize that “voluntary action by industry alone” will not be sufficient.

The authors call on governments to: set global direction and create an international framework for action through the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA), building on the vision of a circular economy for plastics; and establish mechanisms and policies that provide dedicated, stable funding for collection and sorting, including through fair industry contributions, as recycling is “unlikely to ever scale” without such action.

The 2020 report uses 2019 data; the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet reflected in the numbers in the report. The report observes that the pandemic “has without doubt had an impact on the plastics system in 2020” and future reports are expected to report on this impact. The authors add that the pandemic presents an opportunity to address plastic pollution and climate change in recovery efforts.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all countries at the United Nations, provide a set of objectives and targets that can serve as a blueprint to “build back better” after the pandemic.

This week, a report card is being released on Australia’s progress toward achieving these goals. It also highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on our ability to meet our SDG targets by 2030.

The report shows Australia is performing well in health and education, but failing in climate, environment and areas linked to social inequality.

The good news is that trust in government has risen significantly since the pandemic began, no doubt reflecting in part Australia’s relatively good response to the crisis.

Australians are proud of what we have been able to achieve, and this trust and optimism will be needed as we try to tackle some of the stubborn challenges highlighted in the report.

Why targets are critical

In adopting the SDGs, all countries (including Australia) recognised the need to take a long-term and integrated approach to national planning informed by data and evidence.

Central to this approach is the setting of economic, social and environmental targets for 2030, which help to provide clear signposts for where we want to go.

Targets are critical. They set the priorities and level of ambition, encourage a shift from short to long-term thinking, provide investment certainty, and mobilise people to collaborate to solve problems.

They also enable a clear picture of where we are on track or off track, and the scale and pace of change needed.

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, Australia still lacks national targets for many of the specific goals, and this is undermining our ability to plan effectively for our future.

The report card makes three important contributions:

1) It proposes an initial set of 2030 targets for Australia across economic, social and environmental indicators.

2) It assesses Australia’s progress towards these targets over the past two decades, highlighting where we are falling behind and where accelerated action is needed.

3) It evaluates the effects of COVID-19 on Australia’s capacity to achieve the SDGs.

Where Australia is falling behind

Our key findings in this week’s report show where Australia needs to focus its energies to meet our SDGs.

Social challenges

Australians are living longer, but are more obese and, since the pandemic, drinking more alcohol.

Domestic violence has increased during COVID-19.

Homicide rates have halved since 2000, yet the prison population has increased by 32% since 2006, with Indigenous Australians vastly over-represented.

Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, experiencing more psychological distress and a greater chance of job disruption.

Environmental challenges

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined only marginally since 2000, and little progress has been made since 2013. Australia is not on track to meet a 2030 emissions target consistent with the Paris Agreement objective to keep global warming to well below 2°C.

Australia’s per-capita material footprint is one of the highest in the world – more than 70% above the OECD average – and rising.

Hard coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef has declined, and the number of species now threatened has increased since 2000.

Economic challenges

Women, young people and those without high school qualifications are more likely to have had their employment disrupted by COVID-19.

Australia’s relatively low levels of government debt will help in the COVID-19 recovery, yet household debt is well above the OECD average.

Wealth inequality is getting worse, with the share of household net worth of the bottom 40% of the population declining by 30% since 2004.

Since 2012, middle-class wages and incomes have stalled.

COVID-19 has stymied trade, foreign investment and skilled migration, prompting the need for new drivers of growth.

An opportunity for major policy changes

This report comes at a pivotal moment. All countries are facing a series of complex and related crises – a global health emergency, climate change, growing inequality, unemployment and biodiversity decline.

COVID-19 has reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but emissions are now returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.

And increased public deficits and debt may constrain governments’ abilities to address social and environmental challenges in the coming decade.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has given governments the chance to undertake much more significant interventions than previously thought possible.

Australia has a huge opportunity to design a recovery strategy that strengthens our resilience to future shocks, addresses many of the challenges of sustainable development that we have not properly dealt with, and ensures the country’s long-term, sustainable prosperity.

“The global coronavirus pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt,” he said. “The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe.”

The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, certainly seems to agree with Defoe (see below) that the world should now look on things with “differing eyes”.

“Another plague would remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes, than those which we looked on things with before.”

These are the words of Daniel Defoe in A Journal of the Plague Year, a vivid account of life in London in 1665 when bubonic plague wiped out 15 percent of the city’s population, and brought the economy of the whole of England to a standstill.

Many of those who didn’t die, lost their livelihoods, and just as in the global pandemic of 2020, after a period of fear, isolation and hysteria, the great and pressing concern was how to build a better world from the devastation. Defoe’s graphic description of the plague, and the subsequent economic ruin has distinct echoes for our times.

Some economists are forecasting a V-shape recovery; a fast bounce-back. But many more suggest the most likely outcome will be an L-shaped impact – a rapid dip followed by a long period of no significant growth, perhaps continuing for many years.

The United Nations, in its response to the pandemic is perhaps facing the greatest test since its inception in 1945. But the organisation is determined not to be blown off course in its pledge to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

The task of finding a way through this world-wide catastrophe has fallen to 71 year old Mr Guterres who became Secretary-General of the UN in 2017 having served two terms as Prime Minister of his native Portugal. The leader of the country’s Socialist Party, he was widely admired at home and abroad for his support for humanitarian causes. He began his career at the UN as High Commissioner for Refugees where he became convinced that sustainable development would be essential for the eradication of poverty and inequality.

Since his appointment as Secretary-General, he has enthusiastically championed the UN’s blueprint of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to achieve “a better and more sustainable future for all”. These include an end to poverty and hunger, promotion of good health and education, gender equality, clean water provision, clean energy and action on climate change.

This holistic response to the root causes of conflicts – integrating peace, sustainable development and human rights – was going to be challenging enough without an unforeseen global crisis like the Covid-19 virus.

The UN had hoped to achieve their SDG aims by the end of the decade, but the pandemic has thrown a giant spanner in the works, threatening destabilisation in many of the developing countries of the world, most notably in Africa, where progress was being made towards the SDG target.

Mr Guterres, attending a virtual high-level UN the meeting aimed at finding solutions to tackle the damage done by the pandemic to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, warned that Covid-19 would cause “unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world”. He predicted that millions would be pushed into extreme poverty, that there would be famines of “historic proportions”, and that we would witness the sharpest contraction of the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis – because of a microscopic virus,” he said.

He said that there must be immediate, collective action in six crucial areas: Global liquidity and solutions to debt; incentives for creditors; incentives to boost sustainable development; a crackdown on illicit financial dealings; the alignment of incentives in global financial systems with SDGs to boost confidence and relaunch investment in sustainable development; and finally, the creation of an over-arching global framework to aid rapid recovery.

“All our efforts must go towards building sustainable and resilient pathways that enable us not only to beat Covid-19, but to tackle the climate crisis, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty and hunger,” he said.

“Getting through Covid-19 and recovering better will cost money, but the alternative will cost far more. This is a global crisis and it’s up to all of us to solve it. Let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future.”

Mr Guterres has been at pains to insist that in the pursuit of sustainable economic recovery world governments must build upon the UN’s SDG blueprint. There was a triple imperative, he told the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in May, to stem the pandemic, safeguard development gains already made, and ensure that all recovery efforts followed the SDG 2030 Agenda.

“Working together, with our foot on the pedal and our eyes on the (SDG) 2030 Agenda, we will get through this crisis and reach our destination, protecting hard-won development progress and accelerating our joint efforts,” he said. “Our objective remains clear; to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.”

One element of the SDGs is gender equality, and Mr Guterres singled out the role of women in the world economy. The pandemic, he said, had laid bare the extent to which national economies are sustained by the unpaid domestic labour of women. He urged governments to tackle the issue in the post-pandemic world to ensure a better recovery. “Returning to our previous path is simply not an option,” he said.

His words were echoed by ECOSOC president, Mona Juul, who said that the pandemic had exposed the disproportionate burden on women who perform unpaid care work and are overrepresented as frontline health workers. She said that the inclusion of a gender perspective, as enshrined in SDG, into social and economic responses to the virus was essential.

Mr Guterres emphasised that bold action taken now, based on the UN’s SDGs, would not only protect the weakest, it would help ensure a stronger recovery. And he again stressed the regularly-quoted phrase that he would “leave no-one behind”. The recovery, he said, had to be focussed on building inclusive and sustainable economies that are more resilient in the face of future global challenges.

At the beginning of the year, the UN announced a “Decade of Action” for SDGs. The conversation at the time was about how to build momentum in the final ten years of the initiative. In its 2019 SDG report, the UN had warned that progress towards the goals was slowing, even reversing in some areas.

Now there are many who paradoxically believe the pandemic, far from being an unanticipated obstacle to SDG progress, may help reinvigorate the project. The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), for instance, pointed to the way many businesses supported communities and the vulnerable during the pandemic, showing a willingness to help society and go above and beyond the normal.

UKSSD blogger, Emily Auckland, said: “It is only by working together that we will create a post-pandemic future that is fairer, just and sustainable.”

Failure to respond quickly at this point in history, said Mr Guterres, could jeopardise progress already made towards achieving SDGs. The UN has drawn attention to several areas where a substantially improved outcome might be achieved because of the effects of the pandemic – one being the question of remittances.

Remittances – the money sent by migrant workers in developed nations to their families in poorer countries – currently account for more than five percent of GDP in as many as 60 low-income countries. During the pandemic, this flow of cash has been dramatically reduced, causing great hardship in developing countries.

But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the global remittance system, said Gilbert F. Houngbo, president of the UN agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He called for an overhaul of money-transfer systems to ensure more of the cash reaches needy families, and less is lost in transfer fees. IFAD is currently in negotiation with financial technology firms, mobile operators, banks and postal networks to find a solution to high transaction costs.

Mr Guterres focussed specifically on the effects upon mental health as a result of the pandemic, especially among the young. “Mental health is at the core of our humanity,” he said. “The virus is not only attacking our physical health, it is also increasing psychological suffering. Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief and anxiety will continue to affect people and communities.”

His observations were confirmed in late May 2020, when the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warned that more than one in six young people worldwide had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus.

The ILO reported that under 30s had been particularly hard hit, claiming that their financial prospects could be blighted for decades. Guy Ryder, the ILO’s Director-General said that many young people would simply be left behind. Youth unemployment in the EU for instance, which still stands at around 15 percent, had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, he said.

This was just one aspect of the potential fall-out from the pandemic. Mr Guterres also drew attention to the plight of the world’s developing nations, especially those in Africa, whose progress towards the UN’s SDG targets was being thrown off course as a result of the economic damage caused by coronavirus.

Mr Guterres had earlier called on UN member states to adopt a “war economy” to fight the effects of the virus. Defeating coronavirus, he said, was the first stage, but the world should seize the opportunity to create a global economy which was more “inclusive and sustainable going forward”.

“We need to prepare for a recovery for a better economy, a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” he said. “We don’t need to replicate exactly the economy of the past. Many things will change, I would say irreversibly in our lives.”

He said that the world needed to use the current situation wisely; “to seize it as an opportunity” to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability in national economies. He also expressed the hope that another effect of the pandemic would be to force governments to re-evaluate relationships with the environment, and redouble efforts to combat climate change.

Unsurprisingly for a man who sees his fundamental role as UN Secretary-General to be the achievement of the eradication of poverty and inequality, Africa is at the heart of his Covid-19 concerns.

As the virus began to spread across the continent, Mr Guterres called on warring factions in several African states to agree to a general ceasefire, in the hope that the pandemic would somehow make peace easier to achieve.

Mr Guterres knows that the pandemic will not be defeated until Africa is safe. Economic instability could lead to catastrophic collapse in the region, leading in turn to more conflict, famine and an upsurge in migration.

“In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people,” he said. “Economic growth has been strong; the digital revolution has taken hold. A free trade area has been agreed. But the epidemic threatens Africa’s progress. It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.”

It was already the case, he said, that African exports were in serious decline because of coronavirus, and demand in the continent’s tourism industry had all but dried up. The opening of a pan-African trade zone, upon which so much is staked, and which was due to take place in 2020, has been postponed as a direct result of the pandemic.

Mr Guterres praised the way African countries had moved rapidly to establish regional co-operation to fight the spread of the disease, including co-ordinated quarantines and lockdowns. He also commended African governments for drawing on their experience of epidemics like HIV/Aids and Ebola in the fight against rumour and misinformation, debunking anecdotal speculations and overcoming mistrust of government agencies.

But the international community, he argued, had to step in to help strengthen local health systems, and try to avoid a financial crisis which could push millions of Africans into poverty.

Elsewhere, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shone the spotlight on the effect of the pandemic on environmental issues, insisting that the world’s response must not be seen as simply a philanthropic reaction. Sustainable recovery and development will need to be fully future-proofed, she said. The threat posed by rising global temperatures increases the likelihood of more pandemics, flooding, droughts and the destabilisation of economies.

Meanwhile attention has also been focussed on the generational response to the crisis. Those reaching adulthood in the early 21st century – Millennials and Generation Z – were initially accused of having too carefree an attitude to the virus, even being blamed for helping to spread infection. But it is becoming clear that the response of young people is leading to intergenerational innovation to find ways to survive and grow.

Millennials and Generation Z make up nearly 40 percent of workers in fragile areas such as childcare, restaurants, and tourism – and are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of measures designed to tackle Covid-19. But these young people are also collaborative, comfortable with electronic communication and the use of technology, and above all, adaptable.

They are the generations most likely to seek out sustainable brands, say economists. Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is a pioneer of in this field. In 2018 their 28 Sustainable Living Brands grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business – up from 46 percent the previous year. Much of this growth, Unilever believes, is down to the attitudes of younger generations.

Elizabeth Uviebinené, the British author of Slay in You Lane: The Black Girl Bible, summed up this opinion, saying: “Despite the uncertainty ahead, I take comfort in the fact that millennials are a resilient and adaptable generation because we’ve always had to be, and this setback will be no different.”

The Business & Sustainable Development Commission, launched in Davos, Switzerland in 2016, believes that at least $12 trillion could be unlocked through the expansion of sustainable business over the next decade, creating up to 380 million new jobs by 2030.

Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, the Director of SDG Impact at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), says that the pandemic has exposed the world’s weaknesses, and “reminded us about how interconnected all our fortunes are”.

“We now have the opportunity to create a better, stronger, more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for all,” she says. “Rather than assume that the pandemic makes our task harder, we should capitalise on the opportunity and space it provides to challenge conventional wisdom.”

In 2018, KPMG reported that of the world’s 250 largest companies, only 101 mentioned SDGs in their corporate reporting, and of these, just eight made the business case for SDGS.

Ms Davidsen says: “Too often the SDGs are used as just another reporting lens to communicate existing activities differently, rather than to make different decisions. While interest in the SDGs has been building, business leaders tell us they still do not have all the tools and information they need.”

Her role, as the pandemic recedes, is to build a common business framework to guide companies, creating a greater sense of confidence in an uncertain time, she said.

António Guterres believes that people have finally become conscious of the seriousness of the virus and its effects, and now understand that global solidarity and co-ordination of action was required not only to defeat coronavirus, but also to keep the wheels of the world economy turning.

Despite the apparent chaos in the global response to coronavirus, the conflicting advice of experts, the attempts to pin blame, the rhetoric of leaders like Mr Trump, the failure to follow WHO guidance by some, the opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties by others, Mr Guterres remains optimistic that the world can recover, and a new, equitable future be created.

And it would seem that his cautious optimism is shared. Global Web Index, a London-based consumer research body, believes that optimism is a key factor in navigating the coronavirus crisis – and its extensive market research appears to bear that out.

An internet survey of 14,000 people across 13 countries conducted during the height of the pandemic in March 2020 found a reassuringly high level of optimism for recovery among respondents, though there were significant variations between countries.

China saw the highest levels of optimism at 93 percent, while in Japan only 17 percent were hopeful of a positive outcome. In the USA and UK, there was an approximate 50:50 split between confidence and pessimism. According to Global Web Index, good communication appears to be the key to maintaining consumer optimism, with those who felt well-informed being generally less concerned for the future.

The Great Plague of 1665 was the first time the citizens of England had suffered such pestilence since the dreadful years of the Black Death in the 14th century. It took them by surprise in much the same way as coronavirus shocked a modern world where such events were seen as things of the past. The Black Death wiped out almost 45 per cent of England’s population in the mid-1300s, and in doing so, also obliterated the feudal system, laying the foundation for a modern nation. Similarly, the Great Plague, followed the next year by the Great Fire of London, allowed the city to transform into a progressive capital. From calamity can come hope.

In his journal of the plague year, Daniel Defoe echoes this conviction with a grimly comic observation that there may yet be cause for hopefulness:

“This is a world of corpses strewn in the streets and pits, yet in the deadcart itself a drunken piper wakes up to cry, ‘But I an’t dead tho’ am I?’”

The summit brought together a worldwide community of more than 5,000 sustainability leaders, including business representatives, industry federations, national partner organizations, NGOs, and policy makers to promote dialogue on how to strengthen sustainable supply chains and create an economic system that contributes to the UN SDG Goals.

The participants included Mariette Herman, President of the Dutch Economic and Social Committee, Koen Doens, Director General in the European Commission, Johan van Zyl, President and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe, Mariam Dao Gabala, chairperson of the International Supervisory Board of the international civil society organization Solidaridad, Sun Luhui, Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals (China), and Björn Böhning, the Permanent State Secretary of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS THROUGH THE LENS OF SDGs

Looking at global supply chains through the lens of the SDGs, the minister highlighted the significant role of global supply chains in achieving the SDGs, as it represents over 80% of global trade and engages over one in five workers.

It can specifically help achieve Goal 8 for decent work through job creation and trade support for developing countries, Goal 9 for industry and innovation through increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises to markets and enhancing the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, and Goal 17 for partnerships for the goals through improving cooperation and increasing the exports of developing countries.

Al Mashat noted that enabling sustainable supply chains is a shared duty between the public and private sector, as governments play a role in ensuring that supply chains are sustainable through enforcing legal framework that protects the public interest and underpins responsible business practices, and regular monitoring of business performance.

In regards to the private sector, she added that the SDGs explicitly call on businesses to solve sustainable development challenges, as business is considered to be a vital partner in achieving sustainability and the development goals.

To push for sustainable supply chains, Al Mashat stated that governments and policy makers should practice “stakeholder capitalism,” which are principles that foster and promote meaningful engagement and offer economies a unique opportunity to prioritize a circular economy centered around human and social aspirations.

RETHINKING COOPERATION



On the cooperation between Egypt and the European Union, the minister stated that the two partners have a strong strategic partnership than spans over several decades, with more than 37 projects across transportation, energy, health, education and environment amounting to more than €1.35 billion grants.

She added that there has been a shift in development cooperation to a new paradigm – development cooperation effectiveness, where the emphasis is about partnerships - governments, development partners, the private sector and civil society – working together to advance global and national economic strategic goals, as well as well as accelerating progress in this decade of action to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

To achieve this, Al Mashat noted that Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation has been working to strengthen economic diplomacy through three main principles: regularly organizing multi-stakeholder platforms to ensure that all projects between development partners are streamlined and effectively aligned with the national agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); adopting a consistent Global Partnerships Narrative People&Projects&Purpose (P&P&P); and mapping ODA financing to SDGs for all projects with multilateral and bilateral development partners.

Since the launch of the lending operations in Egypt in 1979 till present, the European Investment Bank’s investments amounted to €10,640 billion for the public, private, banking, equity funds, and finances more than 95 projects in various priority sectors for the Egyptian government such as: renewable energy, transportation, water and waste water, and SMEs.","CAIRO - 1 November 2020: Minister of International Cooperation, Rania Al Mashat, participated in the European Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit for 2020, which makes it the first for Egypt to ever take part in the annual gathering.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

“Let’s get on with it.” That’s the message Dominic O’Neill, executive director of the newly launched Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, has for the sector on World Toilet Day.

“We know what needs to happen and we have a lot of good examples, but we now need to take it to scale and to bring about this much-needed change,” he said, adding that with progress on access to safely managed sanitation “well off-track” and “significantly overdue,” a change in collective behavior and commitment from all is vital.

Around the world, more than 4 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines, and 3 billion don’t have a basic hand-washing facility with water and soap at home.

“SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene Fund

To help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week. Working with donors and other partners, it aims to enhance the international response to the sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health crisis by providing grants to low-income countries for community-based solutions.

O’Neill said now is the time for a different type of approach.

“Not just because of COVID-19, but this is a very significant moment where the whole world is talking about the need for good basic hygiene in a way that we couldn’t have dreamed of before and they have a different level of understanding.”

How to campaign for WASH during an election With multiple elections on the calendar for 2020, WASH professionals discuss how to make clean water access and improved sanitation a priority for politicians.

Speaking to Devex, O’Neill explained why progress has been waning on Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 on sanitation and hygiene and the gaps this new fund can help to plug.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

What is the status of progress around SDG 6, and how does its progress impact other SDGs?

We know that in particular, SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it. Presently, we see nothing that is changing business as usual in a way that will make the difference. Goodwill and effort alone will not get us to our collective goal. Our feeling is that something isn’t working in the current approach and we want to change that.

This isn’t just about hitting that SDG on safely managed sanitation. We know the outcomes of having better sanitation and hygiene are much broader including the impact on girls’ education, gender equality, reducing sexual and gender-based violence, and on critical health indicators.

One of the other outcomes that we want to really focus on is the economic impact, not only the negative impact of people getting ill from preventable diseases and not being able to go to work but the economic potential and opportunity within the sanitation economy.

Speaking at the launch of the new Sanitation and Hygiene Fund on Nov. 17, Executive Director Dominic O’Neill said, “We know that money, well utilized, has the ability to drive positive and lasting change.” Photo by: SHF

If sanitation plays such an obviously central role in development, why are we not making adequate progress?

The sector is often poorly understood and lacks a champion. We’re hoping to turn over some typical thinking about sanitation because this isn’t just about the health indicators. This is a matter of basic human rights. This is about the dignity and ability to carry out normal bodily functions in a safe, hygienic, and dignified way so we need to raise awareness. We’ve done a lot of work over the last few years looking at the human rights element, and that’s a very important part of the approach for us.

This is an SDG target, but it’s also a very basic human right. Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better, in terms of the national and local benefit from a health perspective, from an education perspective, a gender perspective, and also from an economic perspective.

The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund launched two days ago. What is it, and what are its aims?

We’re evolving out of an organization that’s existed for 30 years: the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, which has been very successful and for the last 10 years has run a global sanitation fund, piloting a lot of equality-based approaches. About a year ago, there was a strategic review, and it was decided that there were two issues around why we weren’t seeing the change in the indicators and why we weren’t having the desired impact. The sector needs to be able to go to scale, and the current approach risks us going through pilot after pilot and project after project.

So this is the basis of our business model: we will raise funds, then provide grants to country governments, who will also co-finance. They’re using domestic resources, but we also hope to crowd in other potential investors, non-traditional donors, and countries that may not normally participate in this type of fund. We’re looking, for example, at Gulf donors, philanthropic funding, impact investment, social investors, and the like.

Through our financing, we will encourage and incentivize governments to present a nationally costed plan for sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health. [This is] a result of multistakeholder dialogue, and therefore country-owned, implemented, and monitored, which means it’s their plan, it’s based on their priorities, it aligns with their funding priorities, and with their own systems. We’re not doing projects, we’re basically inserting sanitation and hygiene into their routine development and investment planning and catalyzing it with external and funds from different sources.

There have been so many good examples of solutions, however, we’re just not seeing that long-term sustainability and the sustained impact over time. That’s because too many approaches have either been projectized as short-term interventions or there isn’t a local buy-in so once that activity stops, it doesn’t continue and behaviors aren’t changed, and facilities fall into disrepair.

“Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better.” —

How is COVID-19 affecting the work of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund?

Definitely, it’s given this issue a major push. As you can imagine, the world is focused on finding a vaccine. However, people [are realizing] a vaccine is not a straightforward issue and that not everybody can afford, or has access to, a mask or can do social distancing. So, you’re left with a very basic and important behavior, which is your ability to frequently wash your hands.

Kevin Rudd's guide to making the case for WASH financing The former Australian prime minister and high-level chair of Sanitation and Water for All sends a message to finance ministers ahead of SWA's upcoming meetings for WASH.

We’re yet to see the definitive entry points. We think we have a good proposition which can improve the facilities in both health centers and in education, and at the household level. We are exploring funding options to secure further support to be able to turn our plans into reality.

As the executive director of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, why did you take on this job?

My career started in environmental health. In 1996, I took a voluntary service overseas placement in Namibia working on sanitation and health education in a district health team, and afterwards, I joined the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development as their environmental health adviser in 2002. I then went off in different aspects of my career including heading up DFID country offices in Yemen, Sierra Leone, and Nepal and I was on the board of the African Development Bank for three years representing the U.K. government. This role brings me to where my early passion and career started.","On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene FundTo help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week.

The asset manager has unveiled the Allianz Positive Change, Allianz Clean Planet and Allianz Food Security funds, which will be jointly managed by its thematic team under Citywire A-rated Andreas Fruschki (pictured).

The team currently includes portfolio managers David Finger, Kofi Tweneboa-Kodua, Robbie Miles and Shibo Wang, as well as product specialist Alexandra Russo.

The new equity funds will closely follow eight larger themes: social inclusion, health, financial inclusion, education, food security, water, clean land/circular economy and energy transition.

The team will select companies that offer solutions to issues addressed by one or more of the SDGs. This in turn will allow the team to tap into specific themes and topics, for example education technology within the education theme or sustainable agriculture within food security.

The Allianz Positive Change fund, for example, will invest a minimum of 90% of its assets in the shares of international companies providing solutions to achieve the UN SDGs.

Meanwhile, the Allianz Clean Planet fund targets companies offering products or solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges related to three dimensions of a clean environment: clean air, clean land, clean water.

The third new strategy, the Allianz Food Security fund, allocates to companies offering products or solutions that actively contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes along the entire food supply chain across production, transportation, quality and safety of food.

For all three strategies up to 50% of their assets may be invested in the emerging markets. The SDG-aligned strategies also take an active approach to ESG integration, including a detailed assessment of the most significant risk factors, and exclusion criteria.

The three new strategies will sit alongsid the group’s existing thematic funds, which include the Allianz Global Water and Allianz Smart Energy funds.

Commenting on the launches, Fruschki said: ‘While each company that we consider eligible for an SDG strategy has a clear role to play in achieving the relevant SDG, the exact extent of its contribution to the UN goal can be difficult to quantify. That makes a thorough, qualitative research process essential.’

‘Given the global focus on the UN goals, companies that directly support them are likely to benefit from increased interest and growth. This may represent a strong investment case generating sustainable returns,’ he added.

The 17 sustainable development goals of the UN have 169 underlying targets, addressing global challenges related to society and the environment. According to UN, $2.5trn of capital is needed annually to finance the achievement of the goals.","Allianz Global Investors has launched three thematic strategies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Citywire Selector has learned.

Ms Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India acknowledged the launch of the Map at a time of pandemic to make economy and society more resilient and sustainable. This map uses critical factors such as enhanced productivity, technology adoption and increased inclusion to identify attractive sectors for investors.

Highlights

Out of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust Private Equity and Venture Capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability. The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors.

The map has also identified eight White Spaces, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs within a 5-6-year horizon. However, these require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

Nearly 50% of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded internal rate of return (IRRs) in excess of 20%.

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability, push forward the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology will be of essence to India as it grapples with the challenges of a post-COVID economy. The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in SDG enabling sectors and IOAs, bridging the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Moreover, investing in the SDGs is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhancing India’s resilience to future threats. 84% of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years) and 83% of the identified IOAs address job creation and industrialization needs, 70% focus on inclusive business models and 50% leverage digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

By mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest, the SDG Investor Map lays out pathways that can bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for SDG-enabling sectors such as Education, Healthcare, Agriculture & Allied Activities, Financial Services, Renewable Energy & Alternatives and Sustainable Environment.

An OPP cruiser, lights flashing, was parked in front of the Ingleside Foodland. There, a few volunteers and two auxiliary sergeants were on hand to collect monetary donations as well as food donations — and they were quite busy.

It was a different story for the SDG Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Stuff the Cruiser event however. Held on Saturday at various locations — Alexandria, Winchester, Ingleside, Chesterville and Morrisburg from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., the fundraiser that aims at filling local food bank shelves was a hit.

INGLESIDE — The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected local food banks — more residents are now using their services, while fundraisers struggle to collect enough funds to keep up with the rising demand.

In order to help the fundraiser, Foodland offered shoppers the chance to purchase bags of already assembled, non-perishable foods. These were made up of food staples — beans, pasta, pasta sauce and cans of soups.

Nearly every shopper that left the store had one in their cart, which they gently placed inside of giant barrels resembling cans of soup.

Yet it wasn’t just food donations that were handed out — so was money and lots of it.

“Usually, we have people handing us five dollars or something like that,” said Chris Quenville, another Agape Centre volunteer. “But today, we had people giving us forty dollars and even fifty dollars. It’s incredible. We even had someone give us 60 dollars. We’ve never seen this.”

Both Auxiliary Sgt. Doug Behn and Auxiliary Sgt. Lambia Kavitsiotis were also impressed with the amount of donations that were flowing out of the store during the fundraiser.

“The feedback we’ve been getting is very positive,” said Kavitsiotis. “People are really being generous today, it’s great.”

“This is their biggest food fundraiser and the barrels they brought are already nearly full,” added Behn.

The Agape Centre, like many other local food banks, has seen its customer base increase during the COVID pandemic.

“We serve 90 to 100 a day for hot lunches, three days a week,” said Quenville. “Some of them are also people we don’t recognize, people that have never had to come to us before.”

According to him, some of the Agape’s clientele is now made up of individuals having come from as far as Toronto or Ottawa.

“When the pandemic happened, they left the big hubs for smaller places,” he said. “It’s been very busy at the Agape.”

Although the exact number of donations had yet to be tallied, last year’s event resulted in a total of $3,700 in monetary donations and 4,400 pounds of food.

372,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/11/26/open-defecation-and-push-for-sdg-6-in-nigeria/,"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",THISDAY Newspapers,Open Defecation and Push for SDG 6 in Nigeria,"As Nigeria, last week, joined the rest of the globe to mark the 2020 World Toilet Day, Martins Ifijeh writes on the need to tackle the sanitation crisis, push to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6, as well as support the roles played by organisations like Reckitt Benckiser in addressing the public health challenge

Last year, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu mentioned that Nigeria ranks highest globally on open defecation, an index that suggests the country is still lagging behind in achieving Sustainable Development Goal Six – Clean Water and Sanitation for All by 2030.

What seems to be the new worry is that the number of persons and households engaging in the act in Nigeria are increasing by the day. For instance, as at October 2020, reports show that 112 million persons in the country do not have toilets of their own, a situation that has largely led to open defecation among the citizens.

The 2018 National Outcome Routine Mapping Report shows that Nigeria loses at least $1.3 billion (almost N600 billion) to poor sanitation, including open defecation, every year.

Globally, 673 million people engage in the practice with over 80 per cent of the figure in only seven countries, including Nigeria; a pool that has no doubt led to myriads of health challenges for the country, including diarrhea, cholera, among others.

To be clear, open defecation is the human practice of passing out faeces in the open – away from toilets, especially on fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space.

Many however do these because they do not have toilets readily accessible or due to cultural practices. Experts believed the practice has a huge link to child mortality, poor nutrition, poverty and large disparities between the rich and the poor; a narrative that spurred the United Nations to include SDG 6 in global goals by 2030.

According to WHO, 58 per cent of all cases of diarrhea worldwide in 2015 were caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate hand washing. This resulted in half a million children under the age of five dying from diarrhea per year.

To address this, the UN established the World Toilet Day commemorated every November 19 as part of measures to celebrate toilets and raise awareness of the 4.2 billion people living without access to safely managed sanitation across the globe. The day often buttresses the reasons why actions must be taken to tackle global sanitation crisis and as well as discuss models on how to better achieve SDG 6. This year, the theme remarks the importance of sustainable sanitation and climate change.

As part of measures to tackle the scourge in Nigeria, Harpic, one of Nigeria’s leading toilet cleaning brands from Reckitt Benckiser, in partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, refurbished and upgraded 47 public toilet units in six communities. It believes if the country must reduce its unfortunate ranking on open defecation globally, citizens must have access to toilets, as well as water which is an essential factor in proper defecation process.

Sharing his thoughts during the commemoration of this year’s World Toilet Day and the flagging off of the ‘Clean Lagos: Use the Toilet’ campaign last week, the Country Manager, RB Hygiene West Africa, Mr. Asif Hashimi said for Nigeria, the increase in sanitation crisis, high ranking on open defecation, obvious global warming, and the dearth of toilets has spurred Reckitt Benckiser to beam its light into addressing the gaps as well as inch the country towards achieving SDG 6.

He is of the view that everyone deserves sustainable sanitation, alongside clean water and hand washing facilities to help protect and maintain health security and stop the spread of deadly infectious diseases such as COVID-19, cholera, diarrhea and typhoid, among others, adding that with the presence of toilets, the country can as well fight climate change as wastewater and sludge from toilets contain valuable water, nutrients, and energy for the boosting of agriculture, reduction and capturing of emissions for greener energy.

As part of its recent contribution, the organisation, in partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources has refurbished and upgraded 47 toilets in Oshodi, Ojota, New Garage, Apapa, Costain, and Leventis in Victoria Island; a move the state government believed would in no small measure reduce open defecation in the cosmopolitan city.

It is believed that this would in no small measure push the state towards achieving SDG 6, as well as aid in reducing the health challenges caused by lack of water and improper sanitation in the cosmopolitan city.

Hashimi said the refurbished toilets at the six communities would help reduce the number of Nigerians engaged in open defecation, adding that, “We are reiterating Harpic’s commitment to changing the stories surrounding open defecation and toilet sanitation in Lagos and Nigeria in general. The brand is interested in tackling the challenge of open defecation in Nigeria as a way of ensuring healthier and happier lives for the people.

“At the moment, Nigeria ranks first among countries practicing open defecation globally. This ‘stigma’ can only be removed if we all join hands to work towards this goal. Harpic’s purpose is to help Nigerians access hygienically clean toilets and also be an enabler for change in the fight for improved sanitation in Nigeria. The Harpic toilet refurbishment project will inspire a big positive attitudinal change, which will impact the lives of the people and the environment. It is about taking action to tackle the global sanitation crisis and achieve SDG 6: water and sanitation for all by 2030.”

According to him, Harpic has been at the forefront in the fight against open defecation, donation and refurbishment of public toilets in Nigeria, adding that since 2018, it has donated about 80 toilets and refurbished 10 public toilets in Lagos State alone.

He said: “Sustainable sanitation begins with a toilet that effectively captures human waste in a safe, accessible, and dignified setting. The waste then gets stored in a tank, which can be emptied later by a collection service, or transported away by pipework.

“The next stage is treatment and safe disposal. Safe reuse of human waste helps save water, reduces and captures greenhouse gas emissions for energy production, and can provide agriculture with a reliable source of water and nutrients.”

He described Harpic as a leading toilet cleaning brand in Nigeria that provides superior cleaning, gives toilets 10 times better cleaning and kills 99.9 per cent illness-causing germs in toilets.

“Part of the brand purpose is to help Nigerian consumers get access to hygienically clean toilets and also be an enabler for change in the fight for improved sanitation for all Nigerians.

“For our 2020 donations, we have had six public toilets refurbishment, 47 toilet donations, 12 strategic signages (stop open defecation), among others. Harpic has been at the forefront in the fight against open defecation. Since 2018, Harpic has donated close to 100 toilets and refurbished 10 public toilets in Lagos State alone,” he added.

According to experts, providing sanitation has been estimated to lower the odds of children suffering diarrhea by seven to 17 per cent, and under-five mortality by five to 20 per cent.

World Toilet Day exists to inform, engage and inspire people to take action toward achieving this SDG 6. The UN General Assembly declared World Toilet Day an official UN day in 2013, after Singapore had tabled the resolution. Prior to that, World Toilet Day had been established unofficially by the World Toilet Organisation (a Singapore-based NGO) in 2001.

The SDGIF will be used to provide mentorship grants and debt financing to women and youths in business, social enterprises and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Fulfilling the promise of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires multi-sectoral approaches that bring together expertise from a range of perspectives. Harnessing comparative advantages and working within the context of respective mandates can collectively make significant progress towards realising the vision of the SDGs. UNDP Namibia, in partnership with SBN, MIT and EIF, will initiate three SDGIF calls for proposals during the respective earmarked windows to provide competitive matching grant awards, as well as mentoring, capacity building and entrepreneurship development training to MSMEs. The grants are aimed at MSMEs operating in any of the targeted sectors of agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, renewable energy, information technology, and with a product or service on the market. By creating a two-tier structure, stakeholders are attempting to ensure that promising MSMEs can access capital through private financing and are supported, while those that show promise are also given an opportunity.

In Tier One, successful MSMEs will receive a one-off limited duration grant, usually covering up to 50% of project costs (or up to N$650 000 as appropriate) with the remainder to be matched by own contribution or loan from a financial institution.

In Tier Two for Vulnerable MSMEs, successful applicants will receive a one-off, limited duration grant, usually covering up to 90% of project costs (or up to N$50 000 as appropriate) with the remaining 10% to be matched by own-in kind contribution.

At the launch, Minister of Industrialisation and Trade Lucia Iipumbu reiterated that ""The MIT's Growth at Home strategy implores us that we look locally at how we can support our economy. To attain the noble objectives of our Growth at Home implies the need to ensure that all strategic levers to support and sustain enterprise development are fully embraced. The establishment of the SDG Impact Facility platform with our technical partner UNDP Namibia is, therefore, based on this premise.""

The minister further stated the business case for supporting initiatives with a direct link to the SDGs is strong and offers a compelling growth strategy for the private sector, as it opens new opportunities, enormous efficiency gains; drives innovation, and enhances reputations.

Also, at the launch, Alka Bhatia, UNDP Resident Representative for Namibia said: ""The concept to building back better and growing our own sustainable future will require a collective effort to not only address immediate challenges but ensuring that the pre-existing inequalities are also tackled with as much vigour as we did with the pandemic. This period has reminded us of the importance of having robust and strong systems that are able to withstand shocks across our different sectors.""

Delivering the closing remarks, CEO of Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia Benedict Libanda stated that: ""This partnership provides an excellent opportunity to scale up financing for sustainable development in Namibia. The Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia is honoured to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility as one of the four major institutional stakeholders. Getting financing right is critical to meet the SDGs and our Vision 2030. Domestic finance and international development cooperation nevertheless remain central for the achievement of the SDGs. In every country, domestic public finance, in particular, has been the largest and most important source of finance for sustainable development. Private sector presents a huge opportunity to accelerate the attainment of the SDGs. However, unlocking private investment has been a major challenge despite the fact that there is enough capital on the domestic market.""","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade (MIT) and their partners - the Environmental Investment Fund (EIF) and Standard Bank Namibia (SBN), launched the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF) on Monday, 2 November 2020.

The Ontario government said its modernized funding model is a $761 million investment to build and renovate 11,000 spaces. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Additional funding for LTC homes includes four in Cornwall, SDG Back to video The list includes Parisien Manor and Heartwood, both in Cornwall, Woodland Villa in Long Sault and Dundas Manor in Winchester. “Our government has been taking historic steps to improve the quality of life for our loved ones by adding capacity and upgrading Ontario’s long-term care homes,” said Minister of Long-Term Care Dr. Merrillee Fullerton. “We introduced the modernized funding model to build and renovate these homes faster, and we’re already seeing results, with thousands of new, safe, and comfortable spaces in progress.” Fullerton and Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark announced details in a news conference in Eastern Ontario, at the Maple View Lodge in Athens, northwest of Brockville.

Article content The government said the additional funding is part of the province’s new funding model that helps break down historic barriers and accelerates the construction of urgently needed long-term care projects, providing seniors with the high-quality care they deserve. Under the project name Southbridge Cornwall (Parisien Manor), there are 95 spaces to be developed, and 65 existing spaces to be upgraded. Total funding is just under $185 million, which includes about $177 million in original funding, and over $7.4 million in additional funding under the modernized funding model, which is a four per cent increase. If this reads like old news, it’s because a lot of it is. In Sept. of 2019, while Parisien Manor was celebrating its 50th anniversary, it was announced there’d be a new, state-of-the-art, 160-bed facility built by 2022. Heartwood in Cornwall will have 10 new spaces developed, and 118 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just over $44 million includes just over $6 million under the new funding model, a 16 per cent increase over the original funding amount. Rural Healthcare Innovations, operating as Dundas Manor, will have 30 new spaces developed, and 98 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just under $75.5 million includes just under $6 million (eight per cent increase) added under the new funding model. In mid-March, Fullerton was in Winchester for a news conference that announced Dundas Manor was approved for the 30 new beds and redevelopment of 98 existing beds.

Article content Woodland Long-Term Care (Woodland Villa) in Long Sault will have 17 new spaces developed, and 111 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just over $55 million includes just over $6 million (12 per cent increase) added under the new funding model. Maxville Manor is not on the list, but back in Sept. the process moved forward when it got the green light from Infrastructure Ontario, financing approved for up to $20 million of what will be a $24-million capital project over the next 25 years. Maxville Manor’s ask has been for 38 new beds, which would bring its total up to 160. The government said the modernized model has boosted support for 74 projects that represent nearly 11,000 LTC spaces; 3,957 are new beds, and 6,796 are older beds being redeveloped to modern standards. Of the 74 projects, 49 involve the construction of a new building. The government said that as of June, there were 38,500 people on the waitlist to access an LTC bed. “The number of people in (SDG) who will need long-term care is expected to increase significantly over the next decade,” MPP Jim McDonell said. “The work underway here will make sure that our loved ones will have a comfortable, modern place to live, near family and friends, with the support they need, when they need it.” The government said the new funding model is helping the government deliver on its commitment to create 30,000 beds over 10 years. The new model moves away from a one-size-fits-all approach, and instead, provides tailored incentives to address the needs of developers in different markets: rural, mid-size, urban, and large urban. It also introduces an up-front development grant to address high cost barriers to construction. “Bringing the long-term care funding model into the 21st century means we have a targeted approach for improving and expanding long-term care capacity in our communities,” Minister Clark said. “For example, under the modernized funding model, Maple View Lodge (in Athens) will receive an additional investment of close to $7 million. This will help the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville build 132 new and much needed spaces in Athens Township sooner.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

376,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/pacific-islands-report-on-sdg-efforts-for-blue-pacific/,"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Pacific Islands Report on SDG Efforts for Blue Pacific,"At the two-year mark of the Pacific region’s sustainable development plan, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat has released an update report measuring progress on the SDGs. It focuses on nine action areas contained in the 2018 Quadrennial Pacific Sustainable Development Report that aim to contextualize the SDGs to Pacific realities.

The nine action areas, which align with a commitment by the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, are:

Addressing vulnerability and increasing inequality; Tackling gender gaps and high youth unemployment; Continuing to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth; Intensifying multi-sector efforts with increased finance to address non-communicable diseases; Strengthening efforts to tackle the dual threats of climate change and disasters; Addressing the consequences of population growth and poor waste management practices; Continuing to address de-risking issues and the high cost of sending remittances; More effective use of existing and new finance and stronger coordination; and Increasing investment in the collection and use of timely and accurate disaggregated data.

The report makes recommendations for the nine action areas. To address vulnerability and reduce inequality, it recommends that countries strengthen existing social protection and economic empowerment measures, develop education policies and programs to promote disability inclusive education, and mainstream an inclusive approach to ensure all development, including COVID-19 response and recovery, delivers shared benefits that include vulnerable groups.

To promote sustainable, equitable economic growth, the authors recommend that countries address the lack of data, methodologies and limited statistical capacity in the region to monitor SDG progress, adopt the Action Plan for the Regional Longline Fisheries Strategy, with indicators to measure progress, and support the work of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to improve labor conditions and address modern slavery conditions in the fisheries sector.

To build resilience and tackle climate change and natural disasters, countries are urged to ensure that local, national, and regional climate change adaptation planning process are effective and informed by up-to-date information.

The report also examines the Pacific region’s processes on the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), by which several countries decide to report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The report points to opportunities for strengthening capacity to involve stakeholders at national and sub-national levels, ways to strengthen linkages between budgets and plans, and ways to build and sustain data to better inform policy, planning, and budgets.

Nine member countries of the Pacific Island Forum had produced VNRs by 2019 and four more countries reported in 2020. The 2019 VNRs identified a number of challenges facing the national governments that reported: human and institutional capacity constraints; lack of political will and ownership to respond to the cross-sectoral nature of sustainable development; lack of alignment at national level with global and regional commitments, including the importance of localizing global goals, targets and indicators, lack of stakeholder engagement with government agencies, civil society and the private sector; limited capacity to collect and analyze data; and insufficient financial resources and capacity for resource mobilization.

On gender equality, the PIF report reaffirms the need to increase the participation of women in Pacific economies, and the need to reduce the high rate of violence against women and girls. The report also reviews progress under the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration (PLEGD) and analyzes country progress reports for the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 25-year review. The report recommends advocating for decent work opportunities for all and continuing to address the root causes of gender inequality.

On the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, the report states that it has caused “unprecedented disruption” and is “likely to undo gains previously reported in 2018” as well as in the last two years. The report observes that COVID-19 has affected the region’s good progress towards sustainability in the fisheries sector, efforts to address the high costs of remittances, and progress to improve returns and increase community involvement in tourism.

At the report’s launch, PIF Secretary-General Meg Taylor said the report “confirms the slow progress on our development targets in the Pacific.” Despite some significant achievements, she said the report highlights increasing vulnerabilities, deepening inequalities, and limited access to infrastructure and basic services, including inconsistent access to affordable and quality health care, and a need to improve access to quality education. She called for the region to work together to accelerate progress on SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).

Taylor also highlighted the Forum’s ongoing work to develop the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, and she said that at least 90% of its member countries are expected to have completed their first or undertaken their second VNR by 2022.

Preceded by the South Asia People’s Forum on SDGs, the Forum reviewed the status of SDG achievements and the actions taken by the South Asian governments towards resilient and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including Bhutan and Pakistan, that will present their second Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in 2021.

Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, advocated greater action on strengthened social protection and financing economic recovery through innovative financing strategies, accelerating digital transformation and greening recovery through the use of clean technology. She also reiterated the commitment of ESCAP in continuing to work closely with member States and other partners in the region.

H.E. Mr. Mohamed Aslam, Minister of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure, the Maldives, summarised the devastation caused by the pandemic on the Maldives economy, including loss of jobs of over 22,000 people. He called upon the South Asian countries to join hands and foster sustainable recovery to achieve the SDGs through meaningful partnerships and collaboration in addressing the challenges faced by countries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

SAARC Secretary-General H.E. Mr. Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, further highlighted cooperation initiatives such as the SAARC Emergency Fund to curb the pandemic's impact and urged member states to put SDGs at the center of all policy making and recovery planning. He also complimented ESCAP for its work on COVID-19 and for establishing the portal of the South Asia Network (SANS) on SDGs.

H.E. Mr. Tenzin Lekphell, Secretary-General of BIMSTEC, emphasized the need for aligning plans with the 2030 Agenda and urged member states in South Asia to work together to address the impact of the pandemic and achieve the SDGs.

The Forum serves as a subregional preparatory process for the 8th Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (APFSD) to be held in March 2021, on the theme of ""Accelerating action and delivery of the 2030 Agenda in Asia and the Pacific."" Inputs from the Forum will also feed into the HLPF to be held in July 2021.

Only countries and stakeholders making new and ambitious announcements were given a speaking slot during the virtual event. The 111 speakers included Heads of State and Government as well as non-governmental actors representing youth, subnational governments, business, Indigenous peoples, and civil society.

The golden thread of climate action should weave through every international gathering in 2021. COP 26 President-designate Sharma

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report of the event, which took place on 12 December 2020, indicates that statements coalesced around four themes: new and enhanced Paris Agreement medium-term plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs); long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, as requested by the Paris Agreement, and mid-century, net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and GHG emissions targets; adaptation plans and strategies; and climate finance.

Seventy-five leaders announced new commitments, some of which had been communicated in recent months or days, or indicated ongoing work. Among the major announcements were China’s NDC-related commitment to lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% by 2030, from 2005 levels; the European Union’s NDC-related pledge to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030; and the UK’s NDC-related target of reducing GHG emissions at least 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Additional pledges included:

Net zero-related pledges by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden;

by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden; Adaptation pledges by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and

by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and Climate finance pledges including from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, and the UK.

The Cities Race to Zero – part of the global Race to Zero Campaign – was joined by 72 new cities and local authorities from Belgium, China, Denmark, and the UK. And companies from the manufacturing, industry, aviation, transport, technology, and fashion industries offered mitigation pledges.

In his closing remarks, COP 26 President-designate Alok Sharma, UK, announced that the UK will double its climate finance contribution to USD 15.5 billion over the next five years.

In all, Sharma said 45 NDCs, 24 net zero commitments, and 20 adaptation and resilience plans were announced during the event. He called for “the golden thread of climate action to weave through every international gathering” in 2021.

The working groups are part of the intersessional process leading to the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) planned for July 2021.

The intersessional process (IP) is proceeding virtually after in-person work was postponed due to COVID-19. The IP co-chairs and the ICCM5 bureau agreed to create the virtual working groups (VWGs) and hold a series of technical briefings in order to prepare recommendations regarding the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020, including consideration for the need to develop measurable objectives in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The VWGs will focus on the following topics:

Targets, indicators and milestones: This Group will build on work to refine targets and consider possible indicators. It aims to finalize proposed targets and develop recommendations for a process to establish indicators and milestones for the targets.

Participation is open to all SAICM stakeholders. A summary document for each VWG, reflecting views expressed, will be considered at the fourth meeting of the intersessional process (IP4) in March 2021.

Online Technical Briefings are convening on: options for strengthening the SPI; the new International Labour Organization (ILO) comparative study on ILO chemical instruments; the High Ambition Alliance; and implementation of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) implementation. During the first Technical Briefing on 22 October 2020, ICCM5 Chair Gertrud Sahler emphasized the need for sound chemicals and waste management to achieve SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The briefing reviewed the mandates and modalities of the VWGs.

The work of the VWGs, the Technical Briefings, and a drafting group on a high-level declaration are expected to continue until late January/mid-February 2021.

For the UN’s 75th, a concerted effort focused on asking a million members of the public for help in steering its next 25 years. Governments also spent several months, during a pandemic, negotiating a political declaration with 12 commitments for re-energizing multilateralism, and they have issued a request for a set of recommendations from the UN Secretary-General on ensuring the UN rises to the challenges of current and future generations.

The timeframe set for the UN’s self-reflection – looking to the world in 2045 – is longer than the usual timeframes of international road maps and agreements. We have International Days (so many that some days of the year contain more than one “Day” within them). We have International Years; 2020 is the international year of the nurse and midwife (thank you, nurses and midwives) and the international year of plant health (thank you plants, too). We are also accustomed to titling ten-year periods by broad goals that need worldwide attention and effort. We are in the midst of international decades on biodiversity, people of African descent, sustainable energy, nutrition, poverty eradication, water, peace, and several more.

Setting plans for longer than a decade is a display of ambition but also reflects the scale of the problem. The eight Millennium Development Goals had a 15-year timeframe (2000-2015). The 17 global goals devised to succeed and broaden the MDGs also look 15 years ahead, to what will hopefully be a more sustainable world.

But it is a singular initiative that looks 25 years into the future and sketches its contours by the dreams of the children and youth who will fill and govern that world, and decide how it is left for their own grandchildren. The UN75 process has not shied away from the scale of the problem. This policy brief reviews the milestones since early 2019, who said what along the way, and what might come next.

Timeline of UN75 Actions and Milestones

February 2019: Governments begin negotiating the details of the anniversary commemoration through consultations led by the permanent representatives of Iceland and Singapore.

April 2019: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appoints Fabrizio Hochschild as Special Adviser on Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary.

June 2019: Governments reach agreement (A/RES/73/299) on the theme of the anniversary meeting, date, format, and outcome, and note the importance of engaging civil society and youth in all commemoration activities. They decide to convene a youth plenary as part of the occasion. In this guest article for the SDG Knowledge Hub, Fergus Watt explains the points of contention regarding modalities.

October 2019: The UN announces a public consultation process to help determine how the UN should improve and assess “the future people want, and the UN we need.” Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild says that instead, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”

January 2020: The UN launches the “global conversation” with a one-minute survey. Over the next eight months the outreach process will comprise 1,000 dialogues in 80 countries, with over one million people in all 193 Member States of the UN, scientifically sampled surveys in 50 countries conducted by two independent companies, the first-ever AI analysis of social and traditional media, and university and think-tank research.

February 2020: The permanent representatives of Qatar and Sweden serve as co-facilitators for the political declaration and begin consultations. One speaker at an early meeting says the UN “has enough documents” and it is time to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlight the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.” Initial discussions also note the importance of engaging women, girls, and all youth. But one says that “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She calls for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

March 2020: The UN75 youth plenary is postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will eventually be rescheduled for early September 2020 and take place virtually. Intergovernmental consultations on the political declaration also shift to virtual formats.

May 2020: Civil society networks hold the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need via virtual formats. Participants adopt a plan for action and priority recommendations for the UN and Member States, including to establish a Member-State-mandated, post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance. Signatories see such a mechanism as ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions.

July 2020: Consensus is reached on a political declaration to be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the 75th commemoration. The 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is less fortunate: the ministerial declaration that was under negotiation for several months through remote means could not be finalized. But statements made during the meeting send a clear message that multilateralism is a priority for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stress that the only way out of the pandemic-induced crisis is through global solidarity.

Among the actions proposed for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, as reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, are:

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

using broader measures of vulnerability;

reform of international financial institutions;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

9 September 2020: The UN holds a UN75 Youth Plenary. One speaker says “people my age are unafraid to make change happen even when the world gives them little opportunity to do so.” Hochschild offers a preview of results from the global conversation, noting that 90% of young people surveyed – more than any other age group – believe global cooperation is vital. He observes, “this does not surprise me at all: young people are deeply multilateral.”

16 September 2020: The UN Economists Network launches a report with advice on steering five current megatrends toward positive outcomes. The authors stress that achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking,” but if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time” in a sustainable, equitable direction.

18 September 2020: A letter signed by 49 leaders calls on governments to undertake institutional retooling of the UN. In a press release, signatory Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, points to “hard months and years ahead,” and says multilateralism represents the “only path that can deliver a green, sustainable and equitable recovery” from the pandemic.

21 September 2020: The UN75 office releases interim findings of the global conversation. The Special Adviser reports that they reveal “remarkable unity among respondents of all ages, regions, and social groups.” This guest article by Fabrizio Hochschild underlines that regarding the world in 25 years, respondents’ overwhelming concern relates to the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment, and this is the top concern even amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents also find international cooperation to be even more urgent due to the pandemic, and believe that more lives would be saved with better cooperation. Finally, people are looking for a UN that better reflects the stakeholders of the 21st century, that innovates more, and that is more diverse, more transparent, more accountable, and more effective.

21 September: The UN General Assembly holds a high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary. World leaders adopt the declaration agreed in July (UN/75/1), which recognizes multilateralism as necessary for a more equal, resilient, and sustainable world, and implementation of the 2030 Agenda as necessary for survival.

October 2020: Meetings following the anniversary event intensify the focus on local-led action (ICLEI/Daring Cities Forum and UCLG gathering of mayors), with UCLG Secretary General Emilia Saiz emphasizing in a guest article, “Local and regional governments are saying it loud and clear. We need to change the game and we are the game changers.” Other events around the world amplify the message that youth are central to a multilateralism that works.

Beginning the Next 25 Years

Writing before the anniversary meeting, the SDG Knowledge Hub editors observed that after a year full of discussions on multilateralism, the international community should be prepared to shape their ideas into “a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.” If, as governments said during the HLPF in July 2020, the only way out of today’s crisis is through global solidarity, then the international community must make time for action along the lines highlighted at meetings over the past year. If multilateralism is to “survive the pandemic,” on top of all of the other challenges it faces, governments and other actors must find ways to use it in humanity’s time of greatest need. This begins with showing solidarity with others. Cooperating to provide COVID-19 vaccines is a key place to start.

On 15 December 2020, UN Member States will gather in the UNGA Hall to begin discussing the follow-up to the UN75 declaration. They will hear Secretary-General Guterres’ vision for reinvigorating multilateralism and revitalizing the UN. He is also expected to provide a glimpse of the process by which he will develop recommendations, responding to governments’ request in the September declaration.

The public consultation continues until the end of 2020. The final UN75 report will be published in early 2021, and will inform the UN Secretary-General’s response to the political declaration.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has said the interests of individual Member States have repeatedly prevented the international order from functioning as it was intended, forcing the UN to “lag behind its ideals.” This is a moment in history when saving oneself begins with helping others – but this will not be the last such moment. As the end of 2020 is finally near, governments that can afford to do so should prepare to help others in more and deeper ways than they have done before in order to save multilateralism and themselves.

The ESDR 2020 provides an updated SDG Index and Dashboards for European countries, reports on spillover effects on other countries, and makes recommendations for strengthening SDG implementation and the European Green Deal.

The ESDR 2020 is the second report on the SDG progress of the EU, its member states, and other European countries. The report is part of a broader series of Sustainable Development Reports tracking the performances of countries and municipalities around the world on the SDGs. The 2020 ESDR examines six policy levers and tools for implementing SDG transformations in the EU:

A New European Industrial and Innovation Strategy for the SDGs; An investment plan and financing strategy aligned with the SDGs; Coherent national and EU SDG policies; Coordinated Green Deal and SDG Diplomacy; Regulations on business standards and reporting; and SDG monitoring and reporting framework.

The report finds that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, “no European country was on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.” The region faces the greatest challenges on sustainable agriculture and diets (SDG 2), climate (SDG 13), biodiversity (15), and in addressing inequalities in living standards across its countries and regions (SDGs 1 and 10). The authors report that unsustainable diets, high and rising obesity rates, and unsustainable agriculture and farming practices are contributing to the EU and partner countries “performing especially poorly” on SDG 2.

The Nordic countries again performed the best on the SDG Index. Finland placed the highest, with a score of 81.10. Other countries in the top five are: Sweden (81.02), Denmark (80.05), Austria (77.35), and Norway (77.03). Even these countries face challenges on several SDGs. Finland, for instance, received red scores (classified as “major challenges remain”) on SDG 2, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13. Sweden scored red on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15.

The report features a leave no one behind score that tracks four dimensions of inequality: poverty, services, gender, and income. Countries with a higher score have fewer population groups that are being left behind. Norway (87.03), Finland (86.69), and Iceland (84.23) placed the highest. Greece (57.82), Bulgaria (47.97), and Romania (47.74) ranked the lowest.

On COVID-19, the report observes that suppressing the virus remains an urgent priority for the EU. The EU has recorded more cases and deaths from COVID-19 than the Asia-Pacific region. The authors underscore the need to strengthen the EU’s preparedness, coordination, and resilience for pandemics in order to achieve SDG target 3.d on preparedness for global health security issues, and to prepare for climate-related and other risks. The report further recommends using the SDGs as a framework to build back better and investing in green infrastructure, digitization, and responsible consumption and production, combined with efforts and investments to boost education and skills throughout Europe and coordinated efforts to reform tax systems, particularly digital taxes.

The report highlights the potential of the Next Generation EU-COVID-19 recovery package and the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2021-2027) to put Europe on a path towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery. SDSN Executive Director Guido Schmidt-Traub called on the EU to “provide global leadership on the goals.” He said the EU has the tools in place to achieve the SDGs internally, but they “must be more clearly organized around the six transformations.” In addition the EU must be prepared to “promote SDG and Green Deal diplomacy ahead of the climate and biodiversity COPs in 2021.”

The report includes the 2020 International Spillover report, which shows how unsustainable supply chains and trade-related spillovers from the EU have “serious environmental, social and economic consequences for the rest of the world.” For example, unsustainable supply chains lead to deforestation and increased biodiversity threats, hindering global progress on SDGs 13 and 15. EU imports of clothing, textile, and leather products are linked with 37 fatal workplace accidents and 21,000 non-fatal accidents per year. The report recommends that the EU address negative international spillovers by reducing trade in waste, enacting coherent trade and external policies, strengthening tax cooperation and transparency, and applying EU standards to exports.

The German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, and the European Network of Political Foundations provided support for the report. SDSN and IEEP produced the report in collaboration with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), SDSN Germany, and national and regional SDSN networks in Europe.

The brief warns that while the world has enough money to fund sustainable development, there is a financing gap and a persistent digital divide to achieve the SDGs.

The brief, authored by Elena Kosolapova, argues that “technology, finance, and capacity building, together with inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, and enabling environments” can help address climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, poverty, and hunger, among other challenges. It acknowledges that without transferring technological and financial resources to developing countries, the world cannot achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The brief traces the history of sustainable development finance since the UN Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and outlines the current global regulatory landscape for financing sustainable development and climate action, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the Paris Agreement.

According to the brief, “financing remains a major bottleneck”— a challenge exacerbated by “slow growth, high debt, growing trade restrictions, increasing environmental shocks, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” It argues the world could bridge the financing gap to achieve the SDGs, estimated at between USD 2.5 and USD 3 trillion per year, if about 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) went to sustainable development. However, “‘substantial backsliding in key action areas’ has been observed,” the brief warns, including a drop in official development assistance (ODA) of 4.3% in 2018, and a decrease in ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) of 2.2% in real terms. The brief notes that “developed countries’ pledge of raising USD 100 billion per year in climate finance has also proven difficult to achieve.”

The brief outlines “persistent gaps” between developed and developing countries’ access to and use of existing technologies, and points to “a persistent digital divide.” Recognizing technologies’ potential to “promote sustainable development and leave no one behind,” the brief cautions about possible risks that could compromise achievement of the SDGs, such as exacerbated inequalities and job loss, and recommends any tradeoffs be addressed.

Improved alignment between development cooperation and climate action, the brief argues, “can help ensure development financing activities do not undermine sustainable development,” which, it says, can be achieved though leadership, renewed commitment, political will, and global partnership.

The brief was published as part of the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series, which assesses “the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing on climate action, sustainable energy, wildlife trade, and biodiversity, among other issues.

The Chemical Dialogue is the main forum for the chemical industry in Asia and the Pacific, which represents more than 45% of global chemical manufacturing – approximately 7% of global gross domestic product (GDP) – and over 69% of global jobs in the chemical industry.

According to the Chemical Dialogue secretariat, the industry plays a critical role in producing supplies to fight COVID-19, including masks, other personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand sanitizer.

The plenary meeting convened online from 5-6 November 2020 to discuss updating the APEC Chemical Dialogue Strategic Framework 2020-2023. The framework: integrates health, environmental, and sustainable development considerations related to sound chemicals management; reflects the chemical industry’s commitment to health and safety and to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific region by providing essential materials required to fight the pandemic; and articulates the Chemical Dialogue’s primary goals. These goals are:

facilitating trade and raising the standard of sound chemicals management by expanding and supporting regulatory cooperation and alignment in the region;

promoting understanding of the chemical industry’s role as a provider of innovative solutions for sustainable economic, environmental and social development; and

enabling effective cooperation between industry and governments to improve chemical product stewardship and safe use.

The Framework will guide the Dialogue’s priorities and actions through four working groups on: Regulatory Cooperation and Convergence; the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS); Marine Debris, a cross-cutting initiative to promote development of and investment in innovative solutions to land-based waste management; and Data Exchange, which enables the sharing of data and information on chemicals management.

In 2000, APEC ministers welcomed an initiative to establish the Chemical Dialogue. It focuses on challenges imposed by different approaches to regulation, including the difficulty of balancing the protection of trade secrets and confidential information with the need for transparency, facilitating data exchange, and the varying regulatory approaches to the treatment of chemicals. The APEC Chemical Dialogue also emphasizes the integration of its work with the international chemicals agenda.

The updated principles and criteria reflect expanded coverage of marine biodiversity and sustainable tourism, as well as “the climate emergency.”

The BioTrade Initiative aims to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through promoting trade and investment in BioTrade products and services. Companies, governments, and other stakeholders apply the principles to conduct the sourcing, production, and commercialization of goods and services derived from native biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genetic resources) according to environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The BioTrade principles and criteria are based on the value-chain approach, adaptive management approach, ecosystem approach, and sustainable livelihoods. Further, the principles and criteria align with the objectives and principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the SDGs.

The ‘2020 BioTrade Principles and Criteria for Terrestrial, Marine and Other Aquatic Biodiversity-based Products and Services’ include seven principles:

Conservation of biodiversity; Sustainable use of biodiversity; Fair and equitable sharing of benefits; Socioeconomic sustainability; Legal compliance; Respect for actors’ rights; and Right to use and access natural resources.

The publication shows revisions to the principles and criteria. On conservation and biodiversity, for example, the revisions emphasize that the principles do not focus solely on protecting biodiversity but also on restoring and enhancing it. The principle now includes language on “restored, or promoted” genetic diversity. On compliance with national and international legislation, the document states that practices build upon compliance with applicable rules under local, national, and international legislation, and the principle now references “local, national” levels in addition to regional levels. On respect for the rights of actors involved in BioTrade activities, the relevant principle now references “fundamental human rights,” and states that the organization subscribing to the principles “respects the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.”

The BioTrade Initiative launched the original principles in 2007, and began the revision process for the 2020 principles and criteria in May 2018 through a series of meetings and webinars to discuss experiences and lessons learned. The initiative launched a public consultation in 2019 to review inputs and incorporate them into the final revised version. In addition, a session on Blue BioTrade at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference discussed ways to adapt BioTrade principles to the ocean and marine sector.

The publication includes English, French and Spanish versions.

The reports find it will not be possible to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) by 2030 without significant increases in committed investment and improvements in investment disbursement delays.

SEforALL partnered with the Climate Policy Initiative to publish the report titled, ‘Understanding the Landscape 2020,’ which tracks finance for electricity and clean cooking committed in 2018 to 20 “high impact countries” (HICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, home to over 80% of the world’s population without energy access. The fourth edition of this annual report finds that 789 million people lack access to electricity, and 2.8 billion people lack access to clean cooking. In 2018, only one-third of the annual USD 41 billion investment required to achieve universal residential electrification and less than 1% of the annual USD 4.5 billion required to achieve universal clean cooking access by 2030 were tracked in the HICs. Additionally, the report notes, investments are not flowing to the countries with the greatest need, nor are energy access investments channeled to the right energy solutions. Investment in fossil fuel-generated electricity increased in 2018, with fossil fuels accounting for the largest portion of electricity finance commitments to HICs for the first time in six years. Overall, the energy access investment portfolio continued to be dominated by a small number of large projects, and capital providers and private sector investments remained elusive in the clean cooking sector. The report concludes with recommendations for policies, regulatory frameworks, institutions, instruments, and business models to accelerate efforts.

SEforALL’s second report titled, ‘Missing the Mark 2020,’ identifies the gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy, as tracked in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System database between 2013-2018. The report finds that although disbursements for energy in HICs have increased at a faster pace than overall development finance disbursements, energy finance disbursements lagged significantly behind commitments of USD 52 billion. Furthermore, aggregate disbursements during the period reviewed of USD 32 billion were insufficient to cover even one year of the annual investment of USD 45 billion necessary to achieve SDG 7 energy access targets. While delays in disbursement have declined since 2002, the report finds delays remained substantial due to cumbersome administrative processes, a lack of capacity among donors and implementing entities, and design flaws that hindered project execution. The report provides recommendations for donors, development finance institutions, and national policymakers to accelerate disbursements and improve the efficacy of energy projects in HICs.

He also encouraged the Council to set robust targets for the eighth replenishment of the GEF Trust Fund (GEF-8), and to support the effectiveness of national-level programmes, including by sharing best practices.

Rodríguez further challenged the Council, noting that recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic provides a chance to address overlapping crises triggered by human-caused biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, and highlighting that the GEF plays a role in helping countries to break down institutional and national silos and develop integrated and innovative policy tools to leverage resources for environmental protection, including from the private sector.

The Work Program offers urgent assistance to 87 of the world’s most vulnerable countries.

By the conclusion of the Council meeting, which convened virtually from 7-11 December 2020, and brought together 184 representatives of governments, international organizations, and civil society organizations, Council Members approved a Work Program comprising 62 projects and programs, with total resources amounting to USD 409.2 million. The Work Program is designed to take into account COVID-19, and offers urgent assistance to 87 of the world’s most vulnerable countries. The Work Program also mobilizes USD 2.1 billion in co-financing, of which USD 1.4 billion is from investments. Among the approved projects are the following:

Combating Land Degradation through Integrated and Sustainable Range and Livestock Management to Promote Resilient Livelihoods in Northern Punjab;

Phasing Out Mercury Measuring Devices in Healthcare;

Promotion of Circular Economy in the Textile and Garment Sector through the Sustainable Management of Chemicals and Waste in Ethiopia;

POPs and Mercury-free Solutions for Environmentally Sound Waste Management in Paraguay;

Build a Blue and Stronger Mediterranean, through the Mediterranean Network of Effective and Sustainable MPAs; and

Enhancing Water-Food Security and Climate Resilience in Volcanic Island Countries of the Pacific.

In light of the recent audit report by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Office of Audit and Investigations (OAI) of UNDP GEF Management, all projects included in the Work Program implemented by UNDP shall be circulated by email for Council review at least four weeks prior to CEO endorsement/approval.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the Council meeting notes that Council Members deliberated on the pandemic’s impact on project management, and considered a white paper by the GEF COVID-19 Task Force that outlines how environmental action can reduce future threats of disease outbreak. Additional issues discussed included:

The endorsement of a new private sector engagement strategy, outlining how the GEF will work in a systematic manner with industry groups, companies, and investors to reverse unsustainable global trends and deliver global environmental benefits;

The opening of discussions on the GEF-8 replenishment, the negotiations for which are expected to conclude by April 2022 in order to ensure a smooth transition from GEF-7; and

Governance of the GEF, including an agreement to pilot a co-chairing arrangement by which the elected co-chairperson would be selected from among the GEF’s Members for the duration of one year instead of just one meeting, to facilitate a stronger involvement of the elected chairperson in providing input to the agenda, the chairing of the meeting, and the meeting report.

During the 29th meeting of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) Council, Council Members approved a USD 64 million LDCF Work Program, comprising nine projects, including three multi-trust fund projects that combine resources with the GEF.

The authors find that the VNR process is an “important engine” for countries to accelerate SDG progress, especially if strong follow-up processes are in place.

The report titled, ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews – a snapshot of trends in SDG reporting,’ notes that countries conducting review processes were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with various impacts. Holding VNR virtually broadened participation in some ways, but limited it in others due to varying digital access for different stakeholders. The pandemic also disrupted statistical activities, which may have affected the evidence base of some countries’ VNRs.

In other findings about national reporting:

SDG institutional structures and mechanisms have matured and advanced in several countries.

Countries that report for the first time can now benefit from the body of experience that has been built up globally since 2016.

Reporting typically increases from one reporting period to the next, with more content provided in the second or third reports. While some second or third reports highlight aspects of SDG implementation that were improved or lessons learned, the authors suggest that “greater continuity between the reports can enable ‘cyclical consideration’ and a structured analysis of progress.”

More individual stakeholder groups are reporting on SDG progress, and more countries are engaging stakeholders in VNR-related processes, i.e. the whole-of-society approach. However, many governments still engage stakeholders in “silos” and would benefit from multi-stakeholder (integrated) engagement. The best way for the VNR process to incorporate stakeholder input – e.g. spotlight/shadow reports, private sector reports, voluntary local reviews – is “still open to debate,” the authors write.

Progress on SDG localization is advancing, as some countries reported making headway in mainstreaming the SDGs at local level. However, further investment is needed to establish local SDG monitoring frameworks, identify existing and new local indicators, and facilitate local data collection.

Gaps in data and the lack of data availability are still considerable barriers. The report stresses that COVID-19 makes it all the more important to overcome these barriers in order to understand, manage, and mitigate the pandemic’s multiple impacts. As an example, the availability of disaggregated data is compromising compliance with the principle of LNOB, the authors argue.

The 2020 VNRs indicate that progress has been limited in supplementing and broadening official statistics, and the report notes the need to apply alternative data and raise international support for statistical capacity building.

At a virtual event to launch the report on 30 November 2020, officials and experts shared views on positive trends and areas where national governments can improve their SDG reporting. One suggested that going forward, countries provide more analytical depth when comparing their first and second reports and identifying lessons learned. The quality of the activities reported also should be analyzed, rather than only recounting activities that took place. Finally, in the 2021 VNRs, countries should reflect on their efforts to “build back better” from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants also discussed ways for countries to translate the 17 SDGs to their national priorities, and the value of using surveys to focus on people’s priorities. Mapping and modelling tools were also highlighted, including doughnut economics, the Millennium Institute’s Integrated SDGs (iSDGs) model, and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) rapid integrated assessment (RIA) tool.

A new schedule for meetings in 2021 is being developed, with the aim of bringing “this negotiation to the finish line.”

The WTO’s 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) and SDG target 14.6 give negotiators the task of securing an agreement on eliminating subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and to prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing by the end of 2020. In March 2020, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the suspension of in-person meetings, and members used online meetings and written exchanges to continue negotiations. Despite their efforts and “almost daily” meetings in late November, WTO members were unable to finish negotiations at the 14 December informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee.

Throughout 2020, members have negotiated on the basis of a draft consolidated text first introduced in June 2020 and then on a revised version introduced in early November 2020. The draft text addresses all the main pillars of the negotiations, including prohibitions on subsidies, a placeholder for a capping mechanism and a list of non-harmful subsidies, provisions for special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries (LDCs), technical assistance and capacity building, notification and transparency, institutional arrangements, and dispute settlement. During the final “cluster” of discussions in the 2020 work programme, heads of delegations provided drafting suggestions on IUU fishing, overcapacity and overfishing, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.

On overfishing and overcapacity, a provision in the draft text allows members to maintain or grant certain capacity-building subsidies if a member can demonstrate that fishery management measures are being implemented to maintain a sustainable level of fish stocks. Brazil and the US urged elaborating on a capping mechanism in the text to complement overcapacity prohibitions that are currently in the draft.

On special and differential treatment, members reiterated varying positions during a 2 December meeting. India had proposed draft text to exempt from subsidy bans developing countries that meet certain fishing volume and gross national income (GNI) thresholds. Several members observed a lack of convergence around this text although members also signaled openness to explore and refine the proposed criteria-based approach.

The chair of the negotiations, Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, said “while I am disappointed that we will miss the 2020 deadline, I am not discouraged.” He stressed “real progress” was made on the negotiations during 2020, despite difficulties caused by COVID-19-related disruptions, and emphasized that WTO members are committed to build on their progress and reach a conclusion.

WTO Deputy Director-General Karl Brauner recognized WTO members’ “intensive work on fisheries subsidies” at the Trade Negotiations Committee and Heads of Delegation meeting on 14 December. He agreed with Ambassador Wills’ assessment and observed that the negotiations have made “considerable concrete progress towards finding a solution that all Members can accept.” Brauner said greater political will, pressure from civil society, and renewed engagement will help members finalize an agreement. He called for “compromise by everyone, on all issues” and accelerated activity in 2021 that continues “until we deliver” an agreement.

The ‘Climate Dialogues’ programme included a number of mandated events for 2020 and fostered discussion of emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

The Climate Dialogues comprised nearly 60 openly webcasted events over ten days between 23 November and 4 December 2020, and were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as the Chilean Presidency of COP 25 and the incoming UK Presidency of COP 26. Several non-broadcasted events for Parties also convened to discuss outstanding negotiation issues, such as on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (market and non-market mechanisms) and common time frames for nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

During an Opening Segment, Marianne Karlsen, SBI Chair, stressed that the Climate Dialogues would ensure that key tasks scheduled for 2020 were conducted. Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, SBSTA Chair, highlighted that the Dialogues would permit interaction with the various constitutive bodies and deepen understanding of outstanding issues.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted recent “encouraging signs,” including a growing number of commitments to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said that for these targets to be credible, they must be reflected in national plans and policies as well as NDCs. She urged more progress on finance, including on the goal for developed countries to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020.

COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt noted the importance of non-state actors as key players, and welcomed recent announcements on carbon neutrality from major economies such as China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. COP 26 President Alok Sharma said the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December will provide a platform for leaders to make announcements on mitigation, adaptation, and support. He called for long-term strategies towards net-zero emissions.

During a segment titled the ‘Presidency’s Open Dialogue between Observers and Parties,’ Sharma stressed that achieving net zero and building resilience are only possible through joint efforts between parties and non-party stakeholders. He said the latter are vital for encouraging parties to raise ambition.

In the ensuing discussion between observer constituencies and parties, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the Dialogues indicates that key insights included:

Governments must work with all stakeholders in formulating their enhanced NDCs;

COVID-19 recovery should be undertaken in a way that also advances the green transition and the necessary structural transformation of economies;

According to the Production Gap Report 2020, fossil fuel production must decline by 6% per year until 2030 for Paris Agreement goals to be met, and yet G20 governments have committed over USD 230 billion to fossil fuels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic;

It is beneficial for a COP host country to “have its own house in order” to better encourage others to raise ambition;

COVID-19 and climate change are gendered crises, and both the recovery and climate action must be ambitious, inclusive, and gender-responsive;

Multilevel action is key to raising national ambition, and efforts by subnational and regional governments should be formally recognized;

Enhanced NDCs must focus on decent and good job creation, protect human and labor rights, and include workers and organizations in their creation; and

Young people have continued to organize despite the pandemic, and parties should give space and resources for youth to self-organize.

During the concluding segment, Julio Cordano, COP 25 Presidency, stressed that the COP 25 and 26 Presidencies and the Secretariat are “extremely well-coordinated” in their planning. Archie Young, COP 26 Presidency, highlighted the UK’s new NDC, which commits to a 68% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, and announced that the UK will host a series of bilateral and multilateral conversations with negotiating groups and parties in 2021.

Guyana, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said: the virtual format is not appropriate for negotiations; there is a “deficit of ambition” on pre-2020 commitments, which developed countries should address; and adaptation is lagging behind mitigation in the negotiations. Germany, for the EU, called for an inclusive, productive, and ambitious set of discussions between now and COP 26 on transparency and Article 6.

Speakers also emphasized the importance of continuing discussions, ensuring that the recovery from COVID-19 is consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, and the need to meet finance and mitigation commitments and operationalize the long-term goal on adaptation, among other priorities.

In her closing remarks, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa urged parties to “work like [they] never have before” to complete the necessary work at COP 26.

Speakers looked forward to continuing the dialogue at two virtual events the week after the Climate Dialogues concluded. The Thimphu Ambition Summit, taking place on 9 December 2020, will showcase leadership by least developed countries (LDCs) on climate action. The Climate Ambition Summit 2020, taking place on 12 December 2020, will mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.

TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Floating City, a virtual island created within the popular Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH), is providing elementary schools with a platform for special lessons on the theme of SDGs. Led by the 6th Sunamachi Elementary School in Koto-ku, Tokyo, the initiative kicked off on December 10 with a special open class titled “Special Lessons in ACNH.” Participating children visited The Floating City for an opportunity to learn about environmental issues via the game.

Here is the link for “The Floating City”: https://the-floatingcity.com/en/

The Floating City is a virtual floating island launched within ACNH on December 8, 2020, with supervision from one co-founder of Blue Frontiers, a sustainable property developer currently working toward the creation of a real-world sustainable floating island in the Southern Hemisphere. The in-game island’s content is designed to boost interest in environmental issues among the younger generation, leveraging gameplay to encourage them to think about the future.

The special open class saw participation from 30 children at Tokyo’s 6th Sunamachi Elementary School. The Floating City within ACNH is home to numerous animals, including some endangered species, and the virtual island also incorporates various activities for fun, guided learning.

Children actively asked questions in the session, which focused on current global environmental issues and was led by fisheries scientist Dr. Hiroaki Chiba, an associate professor at Kitasato University. After the lesson, Dr. Chiba commented, “Learning about the environment through games is a great educational tool which creates an opportunity to think about environmental issues and the future.”

In the special lesson, children experienced The Floating City within ACNH through gameplay, deepening their understanding of environmental issues while visiting the island’s various virtual facilities. They learned about sustainable living on The Floating City, which echoes a real floating island, with a wind farm to create electricity through the power of nature and a restaurant serving dishes prepared only from ingredients grown on the island. The game also provides enjoyable opportunities to experience environmental issues, such as visiting a museum of endangered animals and talking with an African elephant. Children were excited by the fishing and bug-catching activities, and enthralled by the island’s many unique features.

Lesson topics: Global environmental issues and the future of fish

Dr. Hiroaki Chiba joined as a special guest instructor and delivered a lesson on what can be done to resolve current environmental issues and marine pollution. Beginning with an explanation of the serious environmental impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels, he described how Japan’s abundant ocean ecosystem has been disrupted by global warming and the acidification of seawater caused by this greenhouse gas, as well as by overfishing.

Dr. Chiba also raised the pressing issue of ocean plastic pollution, pointing out that the cumulative amount of plastic waste in the world is predicted to exceed 12 billion tons by 2050. These plastics are the source of countless “microplastic” particles that cannot be broken down by waves or ultraviolet rays, and even hold the potential to turn oceans into a plastic “soup” uninhabitable to fish. When asked by the children about fish populations around the world, Dr. Chiba explained that fish numbers are decreasing worldwide due to shrinking habitats for cold-water fish caused by global warming and rising sea temperatures.

Finally, students studied the adverse impacts of environmental damage on humans. They learned what they can do to be more eco-friendly and help prevent marine pollution, including practicing the three R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle) and purchasing ecolabelled products.

About The Floating City and Blue Frontiers

Floating cities are a pioneering sustainability solution whose potential to combat various environmental issues has even seen them discussed by a UN-Habitat roundtable. The rich natural surroundings of this in-game recreation have numerous features designed to help users enjoy learning about sustainability and environmental issues––from the many animals representing endangered species who welcome visitors to the island, to fishing and bug-catching activities that generate a warning when users catch more than they need. The Floating City’s guided learning opportunities even include a museum dedicated to extinct animals and a restaurant with a menu that spotlights disappearing ingredients.

The Floating City was created under the supervision of one co-founder of Blue Frontiers, a company that aims to build an environmentally friendly, sustainable floating island in the near future. Visit https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/ for more information.

393,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/better-care-updates-on-sdg-goal-3-in-the-dominican-republic/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Better Care: Updates on SDG 3 in the Dominican Republic,"SEATTLE, Washington — The Dominican Republic has made moderate improvements toward U.N. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which aims for good health and wellbeing in a population. In spite of this headway, the country still has major obstacles to overcome – including high rates of traffic deaths, adolescent fertility and child mortality – before it can consider SDG 3 accomplished.

Traffic Deaths

Frequent traffic deaths pose one problem impeding the Dominican Republic’s public health agenda. In fact, the Dominican Republic has the highest rate of traffic deaths per person in the Americas. The rate of traffic deaths in the small Caribbean country was 29.3 per 100,000 people in 2013. By 2016, it increased to 34.6 per 100,000. That same year, average rates in Europe totaled only 9.3 per 100,000 people.

Part of the issue stems from the local popularity of two and three-wheeled vehicles, whose riders comprise approximately 46.6% of traffic deaths in the Latin Caribbean. Two-wheeled vehicles are the preferred transportation in the region because of their heightened maneuverability and fuel efficiency. In response to this high frequency of traffic deaths, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is directing monitoring efforts and making tailored recommendations in line with its Plan of Action on Road Safety. These include recommendations for infrastructure maintenance, tighter traffic legislation and public awareness campaigns directed at underreporting.

Adolescent Fertility

The rate of adolescent fertility in the Dominican Republic has slightly decreased in recent years, but it still remains high. From 2017 to 2018, it decreased from 94.3 to 93 births per 1,000 people in girls aged 15 to 19. As with traffic deaths per person, the Dominican Republic experiences the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the Latin Caribbean, the region with the second-highest rate in the world (after sub-Saharan Africa).

Early pregnancy falls under SDG 3 in part because it poses a health risk to both mother and child. According to the NGO Girls Not Brides, pregnancy and birth-related issues cause 70,000 annual deaths worldwide among adolescent girls. Fortunately, the prevalence of skilled health workers in the Dominican Republic keeps this figure low domestically. In 2015, 99.6% of births on the island had trained medical personnel on hand, and infants who received at least two WHO-recommended vaccines had a 94% survival rate.

Child Mortality

In 2018, the national mortality rate among children under the age of five was 28.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This marks an improvement over 2014, where the reported rate was 35 deaths per 1,000 live births. However, this improvement is undermined by increases in the maternal mortality rate, which escalated from 90 to 104.4 deaths per 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2017. This is seven times higher than that of the United States. The leading cause of maternal mortality in the Dominican Republic is internal hemorrhaging.

Pablo Wagner, hospital director at Los Mina Hospital in Santo Domingo, blames the high mortality rate on poor infrastructure. Hospitals like his deliver births for free under the Dominican Republic’s public healthcare option. Given the extent of domestic poverty, however, they are crowded by mothers who cannot afford private treatment. In numbers, Los Minos is equipped to handle 1,500 to 2,000 births per year. Instead, it handles between 12,000 and 13,000 births annually. Many of these patients have received little to no maternal education or prenatal care and are therefore unable to distinguish internal hemorrhaging from other pains, bypassing the window in which doctors can save them.

While the Dominican Republic is improving on its goal to bring good health and wellness to its citizens, the new administration – which took over in August 2020 – still has significant hurdles to overcome, particularly in infrastructure and public health awareness.

Robeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The fund would be benchmark unaware and applied Robeco’s proprietary SDG assessment framework which screen companies that contribute positively to the SDGs.

The SDGs were a set of 17 goals and 169 targets for government, business and society with the aim to reduce inequality, eradicate poverty and protect the environment.

The fund would be an actively-managed global credit strategy that could invest in opportunities across different segments in the credit market, ranging from investment grade to emerging markets credits to high yield.

Stephen Dennis, head of Robeco Australia, said the launch of the fund in the local market provided investors the opportunity to tap into Robeco’s global expertise in credit investing, and market-leading approach to sustainable investing.

“Local wholesale and institutional investors are increasingly responding to the sustainability demands of their clients and members, and the ability to access the SDG credit income fund is a development that will be welcomed by them,” Dennis said.

September 2020 marked the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the SDGs and Robeco urged the global investment community to do more as part of the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Sustainable investing is not going away; in fact, it’s only going to continue to evolve and attract further investor demand,” Dennis said.

“Investors are in a unique position to direct capital to companies that provide solutions to sustainability challenges.

“Robeco’s focus on this area over a long period of time means we’ve been able to refine our processes, and continue to offer investors products that not only generate market-leading returns, but also contribute on a practical level to the objectives of the UN SDGs.”","Select rating Give it 1/5 Give it 2/5 Give it 3/5 Give it 4/5 Give it 5/5 Cancel ratingRobeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

This article is part of the series — Post-Pandemic Development Priorities.

COVID-19 and the subsequent stringent lockdown has created large disruptions to economic activities in the short run, has brought a permanent loss of output and has impacted long-term potential growth. A similar disruption occurred to public policy choices — leading to their shifting away from achieving long-term development goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to minimising disruptions to short-term growth. With the increasing pressures on governments to undertake austerity measures and with dwindling fiscal space, it appears that focus on the SDGs could have been reduced. But, in our view, the pandemic actually provides an opportunity to recalibrate public policy towards a long-term sustainable development path as this could also absorb unanticipated shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in the future. Indeed, Goal 8 of the SDGs aims to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all,” and front-loading policies to achieve this goal could help post-pandemic recovery in a sustainable way.

In India, in our view, while the public policy discourse is limited and scattered among few states and at the Central government level, integration of the SDG goals within the long-term national and sub-national goals is limited. As the SDGs provide a neat analytical framework towards 2030, the domestic macroeconomic policies could have integrated these goals as part of the national strategy. For instance, the most important fiscal rules that India has adopted is the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (Amendment Act) (FRBM), 2018 — which is based on the FRBM Review Committee report of 2017 — does not even include SDGs in their report. While this is based on anticipated expenditures, costing could have been included as part of the rules; the report and the subsequent Act completely ignore that the SDGs need assessment expenditures. Hence, this leads to risk of failing on both counts — missing the fiscal rules as well as missing the achievement of goals. In a way, such flawed fiscal rules could be one of the main reasons for slowdown in the output growth even before the pandemic hit the economy. We do hope that the 15th Finance Commission report, that was recently submitted, could have addressed such flaws by making robust fiscal rules that include long term goals such as the SDGs as well as the growth aspirations of the country. We do have two other medium-term goals such as the New India 2022 and the aim of making India a US$ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25. Looking at the terms of reference to the 15th Finance Commission, these two goals appear to be independent of the SDG goals, which is puzzling. Now the pandemic has only worsened any such integration plans, if there were any integration plans at all to begin with.

Goal 8 of the SDGs aims to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all,” and front-loading policies to achieve this goal could help post-pandemic recovery in a sustainable way.

SDG-8 is not necessarily a new one for India as the erstwhile 12th Five Year Plan, indeed, focussed on most of the aspects covered by this SDG. Although there was no formal review of the outcomes of the Plan, the dismantling of the Planning Commission along with the subsequent shocks due to demonetisation and messy GST implementation, there appears to be large shocks to the growth potential of the economy. With all these factors, and primarily due to the dismantling of the Planning Commission, there is an institutional vacuum that can focus on the SDGs. However, at the state level, as there are still State Planning Boards and some have already constituted SDG commissions, planning and implementation appears to be better.

Of late, NITI Aayog has started undertaking measures that are shifting focus towards some aspects of these goals. However, there is less focus/assessment with regard to the “decent work” aspects and also the MSME sectors that are the focus of SDG 8. The painful reverse migration immediately after the lockdown that caught both state and central governments unaware suggests that achieving “decent work for all” needs a lot more policy focus than what has been done till now. Similarly, while there were so many demands to provide fiscal support to the MSME sector, especially since there have been high mortality due to three subsequent shocks (demonetisation, GST, and COVID-19/lockdown), the governments appear clueless regarding the existence, survival and demise of MSMEs. In other words, there were no databases/records about this sector, thus, weakening the policy efficacy. Regarding formalisation of the informal sector, which is one of the aspects of decent work, there seems to be some improvement. However, the closure of MSMEs do look like they will hugely out-weigh the numbers that have entered the formal sector.

The painful reverse migration immediately after the lockdown that caught both state and central governments unaware suggests that achieving “decent work for all” needs a lot more policy focus than what has been done till now.

Now, the question is, what needs to be done to recalibrate public policy towards achieving the SDGs in the post-pandemic period? As we still have a decade to achieve the goals, it is necessary to mainstream these goals into the country’s long term economic and human development goals. As we learnt during the Millennium Development Goals period, it is important to prioritise the goals, identify indicators, assess the gaps, assess the financial needs and, at the end, integrate them all with the overall macroeconomic framework. In a sense, we need to have what is called an ‘SDG consistent Macroeconomic Framework’ that is quantifiable, trackable as well as easy to implement. Further, while financial resources are crucial, our own studies at the state level suggest that increasing allocation alone is not sufficient to ensure better outcomes. It is good governance at the implementation level (at the district level) that becomes a pre-condition for achieving the goals through improving public expenditure efficiency. As all the SDGs are interlinked, in our view, at least for developing countries such as India and also for the Least Developed Countries, it is important to focus on Goal-17 to “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development” (especially 17.18 and 17.19) in order to achieve the rest of the goals.

To sum up, while the pandemic did, indeed, bring a major disruption in achieving the SDGs, in our view, it also provides an opportunity to rebuild with a focus on long term economic and social goals such as the SDGs. For this, there is a need to prioritise and integrate these goals into mainstream macroeconomic policies with strong democratic institutions that help in ensuring good governance.","It is good governance at the implementation level that becomes a pre-condition for achieving the goals through improving public expenditure efficiency.

This article is part of the series — Post-Pandemic Development Priorities.

The ravages to economic growth and employment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic obviates the need for a rights-based approach to recovery. In pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, the interlocking goals of achieving economic growth and providing decent work will be well served by an enhanced values framework rather than mere functional lines of cooperation.

The Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 8, focus on promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and full and productive employment and decent work for all. BIMSTEC members had made some progress towards achieving SDG 8, according to the 2020 ESCAP report on the SDGs.

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has adversely affected the achievement of SDG 8, and indeed many other indicators, as BIMSTEC economies came to a standstill. In India, for example, a “historic fall” in GDP figures (-23.9% in Q1) may have caused long-term damage to pre-existing jobless growth. Some 21 million salaried jobs were lost and millions returned home to rural areas amidst a draconian lockdown. Unemployment has soared to historic levels, thus, imperiling millions in precarious work, including migrant workers and the poor.

The pandemic has imperiled the achievement of SDG 8 targets.

This dismal picture is repeated across the BIMSTEC area, which is home to 1.5 billion people (21 percent of the world’s population). Bangladesh’s economic growth is reportedly in “dire straits” as it copes with the Rohingya refugees and the percentage of people below the poverty line is expected to double to 40 percent by the end of 2020. Myanmar’s economy, amidst civil conflict in various parts of the country and a turbulent transition to democracy, is expected to contract severely. Thailand’s economy, amidst protracted nation-wide student protests, is expected to contract by 5 percent in 2020, one of the sharpest declines in Asia and the Pacific, resulting in major job losses, particularly in the tourism sector, which comprises 15 percent of GDP. The impact on household welfare is severe, with household debt standing at worrisome levels. Other members, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka suffer likewise.

Globally, the United Nations (UN) expected some job losses for 1.6 billion workers globally in the informal sectors and a slow down in GDP per capita, which had already slowed to 1.5 percent in 2019. The pandemic, has thus, imperiled the achievement of SDG 8 targets.

In its COVID-19 Guidance (May 2020), the UN’s human rights office has noted that “respect for human rights across the spectrum, including economic, social, cultural, and civil and political rights, will be fundamental to the success of the public health response and recovery from the pandemic.” The SDGs, endorsed by all BIMSTEC members, embodies a move towards a values-oriented foundation for cooperation and connectivity.

The 17 SDGs aim at core human rights objectives. For example, achieving employment for all and decent work are directly related to the fundamental human right to work. General Comment 18 (2005) of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), an authoritative statement on the related international convention, stipulates the right to work as a fundamental right and notes its intimate connection with, inter alia, the right to decent, freely chosen and secure work according to international labour standards.

The SDG process allows for localisation and improvement on the SDG indicators.

BIMSTEC as an organisation may guide its members in better steering, framing and mainstreaming a rights-based approach. BIMSTEC members would do well to recall the conceptual framework for human rights and poverty reduction published by the UN in 2004. In the Foreword to the conceptual framework, the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that human rights may seem distant if your family is starving, if you cannot protect yourself or them from preventable illnesses, or provide your children with basic education. “Yet it is in circumstances of crisis and extreme deprivation that human rights assume their greatest importance.” He continued that a human rights approach to poverty reduction is increasingly being recognised internationally and is gradually being implemented. Asking, “What is a human rights approach to poverty reduction?” he answered: “It links poverty reduction to questions of obligation, rather than welfare or charity. It compels us to look behind national averages and identify the most vulnerable people and design strategies to help them.” He continued: “A human rights approach is grounded in the United Nations Charter.”

In this vein, one effective way of achieving this is to engage gradually in the process of refining and improving on the indicators for SDG 8 and bring them in line with more comprehensive rights-based indicators. The SDG process allows for localisation and improvement on the SDG indicators.

In relation to the right to work, for example, the BIMSTEC Secretariat may draw upon Human Rights Indicators: A Guide to Measurement (2012) for guidance. The Guide, in Table 8 on page 71, distinguishes between structural, process and outcome indicators for the right to work. Put together, the illustrative indicators for the right to decent and productive work would comprise, inter alia:

Structural • International human rights and ILO treaties relevant to the right to work ratified by the State. • Date of entry into force and coverage of the right to work in the constitution or other forms of superior law. • Date of entry into force and coverage of domestic laws for implementing the right to work, including regulations to ensure equal opportunities for all and eliminate employment-related discrimination as well as (temporary) special measures for target groups (eg., women, children, indigenous persons, migrants). • Number of registered and/or active NGOs (per 100,000 persons), including trade unions, involved in the promotion and protection of the right to work. • Time frame and coverage of a national policy for full and productive employment. • Date of entry into force and coverage of regulations and procedures to ensure safe and

healthy working conditions, including an environment free of sexual harassment, and establishing an independent monitoring body. • Maximum number of working hours per week stipulated by law. • Minimum age for employment by occupation type. • Duration of maternity, paternity and parental leave and leave entitlements on medical grounds and proportion of wages paid in covered period. Process • Proportion of received complaints on the right to work, including just and safe working conditions, investigated and adjudicated by the national human rights institution, human rights ombudsperson or other mechanisms (eg., ILO procedures, trade unions) and the proportion of these responded to effectively by the Government. • Proportion of target population receiving effective support to (re)enter the labour market. • Annual employment growth (job creation rates) by education level. • Average time spent on unpaid domestic or family care work as well as on unpaid work in family business by women, men and children. • Proportion of requests by parent or guardian for certified childcare arrangements (eg., kindergarten) reviewed and met in the reporting period. • Average number of job applications before being invited to an interview, by target group (eg., ILO discrimination testing surveys). Outcome • Employment-to-population ratios, by sex, target group and education level. • Proportion of voluntary part-time workers to total part-time employed population. • Share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector. • Proportion of workers in precarious employment (eg., short-, fixed-term, casual, seasonal workers).

In the post-pandemic world, a values framework must guide a sustainable recovery. The enhancement of the SDG framework in line with the human rights norms and indicators should not be onerous, given the voluntarism of the SDG process, that the SDGs aim at core human rights objectives, that all BIMSTEC members have accepted the SDGs and that they are all bound by international human rights law to begin with. India, as one of the Asian drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, can play a leading role in this endeavour.","The SDG process allows for localisation and improvement on the SDG indicators.

The open class saw participation from 30 children at Tokyo’s sixth Sunamachi Elementary School. The Floating City within ACNH is home to numerous animals, including some endangered species, and the virtual island also incorporates various activities for fun, guided learning.

Children actively asked questions in the session, which focused on current global environmental issues and was led by fisheries scientist Dr Hiroaki Chiba, an associate professor at Kitasato University. After the lesson, Dr Chiba commented, “Learning about the environment through games is a great educational tool which creates an opportunity to think about environmental issues and the future.”

Dr Hiroaki Chiba joined as a special guest instructor and delivered a lesson on what can be done to resolve current environmental issues and marine pollution. Beginning with an explanation of the serious environmental impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels, he described how Japan’s abundant ocean ecosystem has been disrupted by global warming and the acidification of seawater caused by this greenhouse gas, as well as by overfishing.

Dr Chiba also raised the pressing issue of ocean plastic pollution, pointing out that the cumulative amount of plastic waste in the world is predicted to exceed 12 billion tons by 2050. These plastics are the source of countless “microplastic” particles that cannot be broken down by waves or ultraviolet rays and even hold the potential to turn oceans into a plastic “soup” uninhabitable to fish. When asked by the children about fish populations around the world, Dr Chiba explained that fish numbers are decreasing worldwide due to shrinking habitats for cold-water fish caused by global warming and rising sea temperatures.

Finally, students studied the adverse impacts of environmental damage on humans. They learned what they can do to be more eco-friendly and help prevent marine pollution, including practising the three R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle) and purchasing eco-labelled products.","The Floating City, a virtual island created within the popular Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH), is providing elementary schools with a platform for special lessons on the theme of SDGs.

Deadline extended Citing concerns over storm sewers, county administration requested the deadline for tenders for the Morrisburg roundabout and streetscape project be extended to Dec. 22. The request was approved by the SDG council. In its report, administration outlined that it had concerns regarding how the layout and location of the storm sewer could create conflict between some of the pipes and maintenance hole elements of the not yet built roundabout. “Staff, in conjunction with the design consultant, determined that the issue could not be quickly resolved without the need for further design investigations,” reads the report. It’s expected that construction of the project should begin in spring 2021. New clerk sworn in SDG council approved a bylaw on Monday in order to confirm Kimberley Casselman as its new clerk on Jan. 1 She will replace retiring clerk Helen Thomson. Casselman began her training alongside Thomson on Dec. 7. “I look forward to retirement, having that second cup of coffee with Don, and be the granny that can help with her grandchildren at a moment’s notice,” Thomson told council, her voice full of emotion. “It’s hard to say goodbye. I’d like to thank the county for the past 42 years — it’s been an honour to work here, it really has.”

Article content Court lease extended

Council voted in favour of extending its lease of the Morrisburg court at the cost of $260 per day for 10 days per year. The new lease will extend until Dec. 31, 2023. The county has had to lease the Morrisburg court since 2001, when the administration of provincial offences was downloaded by the province. South Dundas currently owns the property and leases it to the SDG. Emily 9-1-1 goes into 2021 SDG council unanimously agreed to extend the unspent funds from Project Emily 9-1-1 to 2021. This will allow for municipalities to extend the program for another year. “This gives an extra year to put up signage on farm,” said Simpson. “We know this year has been rough on everyone, especially farmers.” Project Emily 9-1-1 strives to create visible signage on agricultural properties in order to assist first responders in identifying specific properties in case of emergency. fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

As mentioned in the book ""Summa de Arithmetica"", by the ""father of accounting and bookkeeping"" Luca Pacioli, in 1494, it is a simple calculation in which the rule number is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years required for doubling. Using this rule for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it can be shown that if per capita GDP grows at 1 percent per year, then it will take roughly 70 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today. On the other hand, if per capita GDP grows at 3 percent per year, it will take only a little more than 23 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today.

Thus, even small differences in the growth rate of the economy over long periods of time may lead to dramatically different standards of living for the people of a country. So, what are the characteristics of an economy that make it grow faster than others? What policies can the government take to accelerate the pace of economic growth? Regarding such questions, Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas remarked, ""The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.""

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 acknowledges the importance of economic growth. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has brought in sudden and drastic disruptions that have ravaged the world economy and will most likely produce the greatest rise in global unemployment since World War II. For Bangladesh, the economic fallout from Covid-19 will be multidimensional in nature and massive in magnitude. For example, as of October 2020, real GDP growth for Bangladesh in 2020 has been estimated to be 1.6 percent by the World Bank and 3.8 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Earlier in April, the World Bank had forecasted that on a disaggregated level, real growth in Bangladesh economy in 2020 would be 3.5 percent for the agriculture sector, 2 percent for the industry sector and 3.5 percent for the services sector. At this rate, the agriculture sector would create 0.10 million more jobs, whereas the industry and services sectors would create 0.21 million and 0.9 million less jobs respectively, compared to 2018-19, assuming that employment-to-GDP elasticity would remain equal to that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the level of employment would be equal to that in 2016-17. This suggests that the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 may reduce employment in services and industry sectors, but create jobs in the agriculture sector, which would reverse decades of gradual structural transformation and stall the development of the economy.

Such dismal predictions seem to reflect the ground reality since, as of June 2020, at least 50,000 low-income individuals left Dhaka and returned to their village homes after losing their jobs due to the pandemic.

SDG 8 also asserts the need for decent jobs. Unfortunately, despite the rapid economic growth, Bangladesh has struggled to provide productive employment and decent jobs for its young labour force. In 2017, the youth unemployment rate was as high as 10.6 percent, whereas the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Regrettably, the unemployment rate among the youth who had completed tertiary-level education was 13.4 percent. This implies that the education system in Bangladesh is being unable to endow young people with market-relevant skills. In 2018, the share of the youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) was 26.2 percent in Bangladesh compared to the global average of 21.2 percent. These issues are particularly disconcerting because the country is now at the juncture where it may be able to reap the demographic dividends if it can gainfully employ its enormous young population.

The International Labour Organization has estimated that the fall in working hours in South Asia due to Covid-19 in the first two quarters of 2020 would be equivalent to 161 million full-time 40-hour-per-week jobs. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling has estimated that almost 140 million people in five South Asian countries and 12.37 million in Bangladesh may lose their jobs due to the pandemic. A survey by the Asian Development Bank has shown that the number of online job postings in Bangladesh in April 2020 was only 13 percent of the number of online job postings in April 2019. As of April 2020, 71 percent of urban slum-dwellers and 55 percent of the rural poor had no jobs due to Covid-19.

In the book ""Youth Employment in Bangladesh: Creating Opportunities—Reaping Dividends"", which I co-authored, we put forward a few suggestions for achieving SDG 8 in Bangladesh that are more relevant now in the context of Covid-19. These include: i) creating a database of youth NEET; ii) linking youth with employers; iii) revolutionising the education system so that it can build analytical competence and instil critical thinking skills in students; iv) increasing availability of technology and internet, particularly in the rural areas; v) reforming technical and vocational training to address the current need of industries; vi) ensuring equal employment opportunities for all without discrimination, prejudice or nepotism; vii) improving access to information at national, regional, and local levels; viii) promoting self-employment through entrepreneurship; ix) providing career counselling for the youth from an early stage; x) fostering an enabling environment for female youth; xi) training informal workers; and xii) seeking employment opportunities abroad.

401,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-soul,"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Soul’: Going Beyond (and Before) ‘Inside Out’,"Pixar head Pete Docter is back with another increasingly rare throwback to Pixar’s glory days, this time a fanciful exploration of the foundations of personhood and what makes life worth living.

Pete Docter’s Soul is Pixar’s third straight original feature, following Coco and Onward, that is explicitly about death, finality and, in some way, what lies beyond.

The convergence of these three films brings to a head a striking preoccupation with death that began, perhaps, in Toy Story 2, with Woody’s parental anxieties about wearing out (“Toys don’t last forever”) and being literally left on a shelf — a phrase that idiomatically evokes the anxieties of elderly parents of being cast aside and neglected by their grown children. (Underscoring the point is the nightmare image of an apathetic Andy discarding broken Woody, dropping him onto a heap of playing cards that are all the ace of spades, beneath which is a waiting trash can full of broken toy parts sucking him down into oblivion.)

Even more overtly, the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3, with the toys taking one another’s hands, was a wordlessly eloquent expression of solidarity in the face of the inevitable.

Death as a plot point or a part of life is simply a part of storytelling, and it has been part of U.S. feature animation since the days of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi.

Death as a thematic concern — recurring or sustained existential angst in the face of mortality or the permanence of separation from loved ones — is something different, and it has become particularly characteristic of Pixar.

The death of Nemo’s mother, Coral, in the prologue of Finding Nemo is basically a plot point, an inciting incident behind Marlin’s helicopter-parent anxieties. The death of Carl Fredrickson’s wife, Ellie, in the prologue of Up is different. Up is essentially about grief in various forms, both healthy and morbid; about preparing for death.

In a more low-key way, Cars 3 was about growing older and passing the torch to a younger generation — pointedly, a more diverse generation. Then came Coco, Pixar’s first film with a nonwhite cultural setting; and, now, comes Soul, Pixar’s 23rd feature, the studio’s first feature with a Black protagonist and a predominantly Black cast.

It’s the best and worst day in the life of Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), a middle-aged musician teaching middle school to pay the bills while trying to make it as a jazz pianist. In his excitement over getting the gig of his dreams — playing onstage with acclaimed jazz saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett) — he takes a careless step and winds up on the path to the Great Beyond.

(Although Joe’s accident occurs less than 10 minutes into the film, it’s the kind of thing I prefer to avoid mentioning if I can — heck, I reviewed Up without mentioning the word “balloons” — but for this review I can’t indulge my most spoiler-averse sensibilities, so caveat lector.)

Joe’s soul — a luminescent, blobbish figure with Joe’s distinguishing fedora and glasses — finds itself on a conveyor belt in an inky blackness, moving toward a vast white glow. (It’s an image overtly reminiscent of the escalator to heaven in the 1946 British classic A Matter of Life and Death.)

As souls approach the shining frontier, they float up off the conveyor belt, losing their visual distinctives and vanishing with a brief buzzing sound that (I hate to say it, but I must) made me think of a bug zapper.

Visually, the image of shining souls drawn to an immense light is far more suggestive of some transcendent higher reality than the eschatology of Coco, in which the skeletal dead, once they are finally forgotten on earth, are wracked with tremors and fade into dust. And it’s significant that where Coco speaks alarmingly of “the final death,” Soul speaks of “the Great Beyond.” Still, that zapping sound nearly ruins it.

Other souls seem content or even excited to go into the light. Joe, though, is obviously anxious not to move on just when he feels the life he wants is finally beginning. In his efforts to go against the flow, he somehow winds up in a third realm, neither Earth nor the Great Beyond, but the Great Before — also known as the “You Seminar” — where preexistent souls are prepared for life on Earth.

Here, Joe finds himself saddled with mentoring a jaded preincarnate soul (voiced by Tina Fey) known simply as “22,” who, despite being mentored by the best — and I mean the best — has never found her “spark” or special passion forming the final component of one’s personality and has no desire to live on Earth.

And here, rather than in some final judgment on the threshold of the Great Beyond, a stunned Joe is confronted with the sum total of a life that he himself can only judge as meaningless.

The director of Inside Out, Up and Monsters, Inc., as well as chief creative officer at Pixar, Docter is the only surviving member of Pixar’s original brain trust who has yet to disappoint creatively. (Lasseter’s biggest creative fail is Cars 2. Andrew Stanton and Brad Bird both stumbled with mediocre live-action sci-fi efforts — respectively, John Carter of Mars and Tomorrowland — before running back to Pixar for lesser sequels to their biggest hits, i.e., Finding Dory and Incredibles 2.)

While it doesn’t quite pack the emotional wallop of Inside Out, Soul is cut from the same creative cloth. Visionary, stylistically inventive, grand in scope and ambition, it’s a true event film in everything except, alas, its small-screen debut on Disney+.

A decade ago, “a Pixar event film” would have been a redundancy, like “an action-packed Jackie Chan movie.” Today, alas, it’s is very nearly synonymous with “a Pixar movie directed by Pete Docter.”

Perhaps that’s giving short shrift to Coco (from Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich), a film with a visual grandeur and world-building panache not unlike Soul.

But Coco — in addition to gutting its ostensible Mexican Catholic milieu with its “final death” business and scrupulously omitting any reference to prayer in connection with Day of the Dead commemoration of loved ones — relied too heavily on two of the most exhausted tropes in family films of the last decade: Junior Knows Best and The Secret Villain.

You could almost say there’s an echo of Junior Knows Best in Soul, if that term can apply to a middle-aged man still facing the disapproval of his mother (Phylicia Rashad), who runs a tailor shop, over his dreams of succeeding in the music world rather than pursuing a safe career with a pension as a music teacher.

But Soul subverts the tropes as much as it relies on them.

Like many Pixar films, it’s an odd-couple road movie and a race against time as Joe has mere hours to resolve his increasingly complicated situation vis-à-vis his corporeal status and his relationship to 22 in order to make his all-important gig with Dorothea Williams. It’s also a Ratatouille-esque tale of pursuing one’s true artistic passion against all odds — except that, ultimately, it’s not, and this is what derails the tropishness of the film’s other tropes.

An important scene takes place, fittingly, at the local barbershop, where Joe has an illuminating exchange of sorts with a bushy-bearded, massively built barber named Dez, whom Joe describes as “born to cut hair.”

The conversation reveals unexpected sides of all participants, in the process hinting that Joe may have almost as much to learn about life as 22. Soul is the most persuasive statement of an idea that Pixar has been noodling since Monsters University: the idea that a life that doesn’t go the way you dreamed can still be worth living.

Even more boldly than Inside Out — which brought us into a metaphorical visualization of a child’s inner world, including a formally inventive excursion into abstract thinking — Soul presses Pixar animation to the limit in imagining a world of metaphor beyond corporeality.

Drawing inspiration from the overtly flat, linear animation style of 1960s Disney shorts — not unlike Fantasia 2000’s Rhapsody in Blue sequence and Pixar’s own “Day & Night” short — Soul whips up a friendly world overseen by cheery, ontologically ambiguous counselors who are all called “Jerry” (voices include Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade and Wes Studi) whose look is part Picasso and part UPA short.

There’s also a bureaucratic, bean-counting (or soul-counting) antagonist — not quite a Jerry but a Terry, voiced by Maori actress Rachel House in a variation on her role in Taika Waititi’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople — who might also remind viewers a bit of Roz in Docter’s Monsters Inc., but without the surprise reveal.

The use of line, geometry, color and black and white in these sequences is formally groundbreaking in a way Pixar hasn’t been in years.

Oddly, like Coco, Soul kept reminding me of a Pixar classic that is not about life and death: Ratatouille. Among points of contact here are colorful visual abstractions of nonvisual sense experiences (much better here than in Ratatouille) and the slapstick of one mind attempting to remote-control another person’s body (very funny in both).

I was also reminded of Up as Soul takes us to a fourth realm: the “zone,” the realm “between the physical and the spiritual,” where creativity takes you when you’re “in the zone.” Those “in the zone” float above a perilous sea of dark sand in which they may become ensnared, becoming “lost souls” mired in obsession. Somewhere among those “lost souls,” surely, Up’s Charles Muntz wandered for decades. (And, perhaps, Syndrome as well, since we see the devastating potential of thoughtless or callous words from one we look up to as a mentor.)

Soul has the sharpest Pixar screenplay in years, with a screwball vibe and consistently witty use of cutaway gags. So much of it works at such a high level.

What keeps it from achieving greatness?

Partly, I think, it’s the same tendency for schematization and rationalization that Docter brought to the inner world of Inside Out, where a child has exactly five emotions, five core memories and five islands of personality; where Riley’s subconscious fears are rational things like Grandma’s vacuum and Jangles the Clown, etc.

Souls in the You Seminar each get a little badge with so many slots, and personality traits are assigned like stickers. Then there’s one special slot for your “spark,” your special passion. No one gets to Earth without a spark, and, apparently, no one gets more than one. This is too neat, especially given the movie’s big idea.

We see how personalities are formed, but where do souls come from in the first place? Soul takes us to the very frontier of the Great Beyond, but can’t manage even a whisper of real spirituality or religious curiosity.

In a heartfelt conversation with his mother, Joe mentions church as the one context in which she appreciated his music. I appreciate that the Black church, which, like the barbershop, is an important landmark in Black culture and community, is at least referenced. And I appreciate that Joe, finding himself in a world beyond corporality, wonders aloud whether he is in heaven or “h-e-double-hockey-sticks.”

Yet is there no moment in Joe’s story where it would make sense for him to offer a prayer, a whispered plea, to God or the universe or whatever power is behind the Jerries?

Then there’s Joe’s early judgment that his life was meaningless, and the lack of closure at the end, which on one level I get is the point, but on another level … well, look.

Joe’s onetime student Curly (Questlove), who gets him his dream gig, tells him that Joe’s class was the only reason he went to school. Later, Joe plays a role, sort of, helping another gifted student on the brink of quitting decide that she really does care about music.

I’m not saying I wanted Joe to have an epiphany that he’s a middle-school teacher after all. But I wanted him to come full circle at least in realizing that, like Dez the barber, he hasn’t been wasting his life teaching middle school.

Caveat Spectator: Treatment of death with brief peril and mildly unsettling images; mild rude humor; fantasy depiction of spiritual realities, including preexistence of souls.

Good performance was recorded for all 17 goals, he said today at the virtual launch of the “SDG Indicators, Malaysia, 2019” report — the second report of the country’s SDG indicators published by the Department of Statistics Malaysia.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals based on five focus areas, namely people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The goals are measured according to 247 indicators set at the global level in 2019.

On indicator assessment, Mustapa said for Malaysia, 128 indicators or 52 percent were available while 73 indicators or 29 percent needed to be developed.

“A total of 13 percent or 31 indicators are not available while 15 indicators or six percent are not relevant to Malaysia,” he said.

Mustapa said the national SDG progress status was also measured based on the performance of 108 statistical indicators.

Among aspects that showed positive progress was under the people focus area, with the overall incidence of poverty improving to 5.6 percent (405,441 households) in 2019 from 7.6 percent (525,743 households) in 2016, he said.

Meanwhile, the prosperity focus area showed the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at constant prices grew 3.9 percent in 2019 compared with 3.6 percent in 2018.

“In line with the growth in the digital economy especially in the new normal following Covid-19, the percentage of individuals using the Internet has risen 3.0 percentage points to 84.2 percent in 2019 from 81.2 percent in the preceding year.

“For the Internet usage in the cities and rural areas, they increased 2.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively,” he said.

He added that all elements comprising the five focus areas would be continued in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) after having been incorporated into the country’s developmental policies such as the 11th Malaysia Plan and Shared Prosperity Vision 2030

“In fact, a new approach will be taken under 12MP to deal with poverty through a targeted programme based on local needs across all races.

“This is because the poverty issues differ according to demographics and current situations. The way to handle it must suit the local conditions,” he explained.

According to him, the SDG implementation requires commitment from all quarters to continue the people development agenda.

“Hence the role played by the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia on SDG (APPGM-SDG) is very critical to assist in achieving the Agenda 2030 goals.

“The group, which was established following the Dewan Rakyat approval on Oct 19, 2019, comprises 10 Members of Parliament including me,” he said.

Mustapa said APPGM-SDG was involved in SDG at the Parliamentary level by conducting local issue mapping activities and recommending solution ideas.

In the first phase, the group made field visits to 10 parliamentary constituencies in four states.

Next year, he said, APPGM-SDG would do the same programme in 20 parliamentary areas, especially in states that were not visited in 2020.

“For example, currently (the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs) offers a current program which requires 50 per cent matching funding and without core funding, an organization like EOAM cannot apply for those grants.”

Having core annual funding, Manley said, would allow the EOAFN to have core staff, essential services, networking activities, and training for operators.

“This would make sure that the operators see value in the services and are prepared to pay membership fees to contribute to that core funding,” he said. “It becomes a catch-22 situation — ‘show me the value and I will pay the membership fee,’ but we can’t show you the values without having the core funding.”

According to Manley, some of the value the EOAFN could offer operators include asset mapping, online marketing, promotional activities and regional distribution. This would also lead to the organization of more special events such as farm tours, and local food festivals.

Several councillors were weary of allocating the requested sum, stressing they would rather see a business plan beforehand.

“Personally, I’d rather see a business plan associated with a request of this nature,” said Coun. Carma Williams. “I know you’ve been around for a while — is there any such thing in existence?”

According to Manley, such a plan does exists and can be found on the organization’s website.

“There are so much work to do and so many different aspects of agri-tourism,” said Williams. “It’s very complex and the temptation — from my perspective anyway — is trying to be everything to everybody and meanwhile being nothing to anyone. It can happen.

“I think it’s important to really focus efforts so that actual concrete things can happen. I have more questions with regards with ensuring that the things would actually be accomplished here.”

In order to address Williams’ concerns, Manley told council he would invite SDG to appoint one of its members to serve on the EOAFN’s board.

The decision by SDG council on whether to allocate the funding request is set to be taken during 2021 budget deliberations, set to begin in February.

The partnership would entail SDG providing the network with a proposed $25,000 a year.
The EOAFN strives to promote small-scale agriculture, artisan food processing, agri-tourism, and local food consumption.
The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAFN) is hoping a partnership can be struck with the United Counties of SDG.

Article content An architectural and engineering design looking into the feasibility of accommodating new office space within the Warden’s House will cost up to $50,000. In its report asking to proceed with the work, administration said the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the need for additional office space. Although council approved the request from administration to move to the design phase, several members had harsh words for the aging building — some of them categorizing it as a money pit.

SDG council weary of investing in Warden's House Back to video EVB Engineering was initially retained in order to provide a structural review of the building. It determined that the Warden’s House does not meet the Ontario Building Code’s strength requirement for office space. According to rough estimates by EVB Engineering, upgrading the building for office space use could end up costing upwards of $400,000 — $300,000 in upgrades and $100,000 to create a corridor link between the current office space and the Warden’s House.

Article content The Warden’s House sits adjacent and attached to the former jail, part of the SDG administration building at Water and Pitt streets in Cornwall. SDG has spent money renovating and restoring the building’s exterior over the past several years, which is now brown-brick construction. The work done in the past however, did not address the improvements needed to use it as office space. “I don’t disagree with the thinking of using this office space, but my read of the documents leads me to believe that it could end up being scary,” said Coun. Steven Byvelds. “There are some preliminary numbers in the report that point to $450,000 and that’s just the big ball park numbers. But when you start peeling layers on these old buildings, it can become a challenge. “I guess the risk for the county is that we spend this $50,000 and it’s through funding, but then we might get less funding for the remaining $400,000.” “I don’t disagree with that stance,” answered Michael Jan, manager of infrastructure. “The Warden’s House could have designated substances that could be very costly to remove. This funding would give us a design that we could potentially shelve, at no cost to ourselves, for a future fit up when we deem the time is right.” County treasurer Rebecca Russell told council SDG could have access to $100,000 through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP). This stream of funding was established in order to build or renovate health and safety-related projects in long-term care, education, and municipalities to address critical local infrastructure needs.

Article content “That $100,000 can be used for capital projects in relation to COVID,” said Russell. “Our intention is to apply for that funding.” Russell also said SDG had also recently received $353,000 through the second phase of the Safe Restart Agreement which, although can’t be used for capital, can be used in order to cover operating deficits. “I think we need a turnkey price on this before we make a decision,” said Coun. Jim Wert. “In the farm world, sometimes we talk about holes that have no bottoms. I would hate for us to go too far down the road on that.” Byvelds compared investing in the building as putting lipstick on a pig. “Now we know that that building is severely deficient in a lot of areas,” he said. “You could end up with a study that tells you that you need to shut that building down until you rehabilitate it and then what are you going to do? “Sometimes you’re better off knocking it down and building something new later on.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

The funding comes from the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF), a multi-stakeholder financial and capacity building platform, that bridges entrepreneurship, social innovation, and blended capital to create sustainable economic and social returns.

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative. We hope that this go beyond the three windows and be a permanent intiative,” he said.","A total of 32 fledgeling and aspiring local entrepreneurs received N$2.5 million worth of grant funding on Tuesday.
